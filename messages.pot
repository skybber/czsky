"## Goal\n"
"**OpenAstronomyLog** is a free and open XML schema definition for all "
"kinds of astronomical observations. \n"
"Software that supports this schema enables an observer to share "
"observations with other observers or move observations \n"
"among software products.\n"
"\n"
"## History\n"
"The schema (formerly known as COMAST schema) was primarily developed by "
"the \n"
"german [\"Fachgruppe für Computerastronomie\"](http://www.vds-"
"astro.de/fachgruppen/computerastronomie.html) (section for "
"computerastronomy) which is a subsection of Germany's largest\n"
"astronomy union, [VDS](http://www.vds-astro.de/) (Vereinigung der "
"Sternfreunde e.V.) \n"
"Starting with version 2.0 the schema was renamed from COMAST (abbr. for "
"*Com*puter *Ast*ronomy) to **OpenAstronomyLog**, or **\\<OAL\\>**.\n"
"\n"
"## Documentation\n"
"Please see our [wiki "
"section](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/wiki) as "
"well as the "
"[doc](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/tree/master/doc)"
" folder\n"
"\n"
"## License\n"
"The schema is released under the [APACHE Software License "
"2.0](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/LICENSE)"
" and is currently supported in both open source and \n"
"commercial software. Just [download the schema "
"archive](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/OAL21.zip?raw=true)!"
"\n"
"\n"
"## Contribution\n"
"In you want to contribute to **\\<OAL\\>** please join the "
"[OpenAstronomyLog discussion "
"group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openastronomylog).\n"
