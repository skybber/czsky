<p>
Mission of this web is to build the engaged community of deepsky observers and to search for new ways to inspire astronomers and make
the hobby they love even more fun.

<i> ... the distant Edelweissspitze is the border of two different worlds. The boundary where the stone rests on the celestial vault. 
About the one from which during the day our Sun will shine white on the eternally snow-covered ridges of the Hohe Tauern. At night, then, 
the bright rays are replaced by a faint silver glow of ancient light from billions of unimaginably distant stars. That light still shines on the 
pristine black velvet of the night darkness in its primordial beauty. It shone so much before the first humans appeared, and it will shine even 
after the last one disappears. Those stars are shining right now so that we can come again and again and be spectators in their silent stage of eternity.
