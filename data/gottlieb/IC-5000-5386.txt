He found the galaxy again a month later (29 Aug 1897) and reported "eeS; eE in meridian [N-S]; curious object."  This time his RA was only 8 seconds too small.  So, IC 5011 = IC 5013.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5013 = Sw. XI-194, for the second time, on 29 Aug 1897 and reported "eeS; eE in meridian [N-S]; curious object."  His RA is only 8 seconds too small.  His first observation was a month earlier and the discovered was listed as Sw. XI-193 (later IC 5011), but his RA was 1.3 minutes too small.  His description "pB; vS; eE" clearly applies to the same galaxy. So, IC 5011 = IC 5013.  Malcolm Thomson equated IC 5011 with ESO 400-029, but was not convinced that IC 5013 was equivalent or applied to the companion on the southeast side (ESO 400-030).

Lewis Swift found IC 5015 = Sw. XII-20 on 18 Aug 1897 and reported "pB, pS, R, nearly bet 2 st with dist. companion"  There is no galaxy near his position that he might have picked up.   Harold Corwin suggests Lewis Swift's XII-20 (later IC 5015), found on 18 Aug 1897, may be a duplicate observation.  He feels Swift's description "pB, pS, R, nearly bet 2 st with dist. companion" is a reasonable fit, though the position is poor (typical for those made in 1897).  But I would be surprised if Swift called this galaxy "pretty small" as well as "round", and his position is well off in both RA (5.8 minutes of time) and Dec (17').  Another possibility is NGC 6923, which differs to 3 minutes of RA and 1.1° in declination and also is "nearly bet 2 stars", one with a distant companion.

Lewis Swift found IC 5039 = Sw. XI-197 = Sw. XI-198, along with IC 5041 = Sw. XI-199, on 29 Aug 1897 and recorded (for XI-197) "vF; pS; R; 2 F st near nf point to it; 1st of 3."  His position for IC 5039 is 17 seconds of RA west of ESO 463-020 = PGC 65249 and that of IC 5041 is 2.5' N of ESO 463-021 = PGC 65258.  The listing for Sw. XI-198 is only 15 seconds of time east with description "eeF; eS; eE; near p[receding] star of sev[eral] curved; 2nd of 3."  Howe rexamined the field in 1900 and found only 1 nebula near Swift's position of both numbers and concluded they referred to the same object based on the descriptions.


Remarkably, this was the 3rd out of 4 times he "discovered" this pair in the summer of 1897 at the age of 77.  His first observation of the pair, Sw. XI-200 (later IC 5046) and Sw. XI-201 (later IC 5047) was on 9 Jun 1897.  IC 5046 was described as "eF; pS; vE; eeF * and vF * near sf, point to it; sp of 2.", while IC 5047 says "eeF; pS; vE; 8m * 31' n[orth]; v diff; nf of 2."  His RA was about 1.5 minutes too large and his dec was 3' too far south, but the description fits.  He found the pair again on 26 Jul 1897 and recorded Sw. XII-22 (later IC 5029) and Sw. XII-23 (later IC 5030), but his RA was 3 minutes too small, and the dec for IC 5030 10' too far south.  The 4th observation was recorded as Sw. XII-18 (later IC 5003) and XII-19 (later IC 5007) on 8 Sep 1897 and this time his RA was 18 minutes too small!  Once again, the description of the field clinches this identification (uncovered by Harold Corwin).  As a result, IC 5003 = IC 5029 = IC 5039 = IC 5046 and IC 5007 = IC 5030 = IC 5041 = IC 5047.  The IC positions for 5039 and 5041 are from Howe and very accurate, though IC 5046 and 5047 refer to Swift's first observation of the pair.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 5057 on 27 Jul 1884.  His position matches a single star on the west edge of NGC 6962.


2MASX J20470744+0018016, a faint galaxy 3' SW of NGC 6962, was misidentified as IC 5057 in the 1921 Helwan Observatory observations, based on photos taken in 1914-16.  It was described as "vF, vS; a vF star 20" following."

18" (8/1/05): faintest of six in the NGC 6962 group.  Appeared very faint, very small, round, 15"-20" diameter.  At first I thought it had a faint stellar nucleus with direct vision, but with careful viewing this was a mag 15-15.5 star at the south edge.  Located 1.3' N of a mag 13 star, on a line with two mag 14 stars a similar distance to the east and west.  This galaxy is misidentified as NGC 6963 in most modern catalogues.


17.5" (7/16/88): very faint, small, slightly elongated ~N-S, broad concentration, barely visible continuously with direct vision.  Located 10' N of NGC 6962 within a triangle of mag 13-14 stars including a mag 14 star 1.4' E and a mag 13 star 1.3' S.  Faintest of six in NGC 6962 group.  This galaxy is misidentified in the RNGC, UGC, MCG, CGCG as NGC 6963.


17.5" (8/31/86): very faint (requires averted), small, slightly elongated ~N-S, faint stellar nucleus.


13.1" (8/23/84): requires averted vision to confirm, similar to NGC 6961.


13.1" (7/27/84): extremely faint, very small, round.  Located 10' N of NGC 6962 within a small equilateral triangle of faint stars.


Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 5058 = B. 438 (= NGC 6965) on 2 Oct 1891 and reobserved on 17 Oct 1897.  He reported "this object once appeared rather diffuse and once quite stellar, is distinct from NGC 6963."  His position applies to NGC 6965 (misidentified as NGC 6963 in many modern catalogues).  Unfortunately the NGC position for 6965 is poor, leading to misidentifications in later catalogues.  See NGC 6965.

24" (9/25/19): at 375x; this number applies to 3 mag 14/14.5 stars that were easily resolved.  The northern two stars form an 8" pair with the 3rd star 15" to the south.  Located 4.6' E of NGC 6962.


Ralph Copeland discovered IC 5061 = Big. 439 in an observation of the NGC 6962 group on 28 Sep 1873.  Part of his desription reads, "A pB, R, neb, gbM in Pos 55.9°, Dist 236.1" from (1) [NGC 6964] has a * 13 np and another *13 sp, both in contact; possibly the whole is a triple *; definition very bad."  His offset from NGC 6964 and description clearly applies to this triple star.  Bigourdan "discovered" it again on 27 Jul 1884, called it a "small cluster in which there are several stars; the brightest seems accompanied by a little nebulosity", and measured an accurate position.  Finally, Baron von Engelhardt observed it on 15 Aug 1887 and thought it was either a star with nebulosity or a double star.

18" (9/25/06): I viewed the IC 5068 complex using a 20mm Nagler (113x) with an OIII filter or UHC filter.  To the northwest of IC 5068 is an obvious second large patch of nebulosity that is generally designated IC 5068B (though possibly equal to IC 5067).  This piece is very large and elongated NW to SE, extending perhaps 40'x15'.  It contains a bright circular 10' patch to the south of mag 8.2 SAO 50061.  A broad river of faint nebulosity streams away towards the northwest from this brighter region.


Rev. Thomas Espin discovered IC 5067 visually, along with IC 5068 and 5070, on 7 Sep 1899 with his 17 1/4-inch reflector. He simply noted "faint" and there is nothing at his position, about 37' W of the neck of the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070).  Harold Corwin suggests that if Espin's declination was off by 1.5°, then IC 5067 corresponds with IC 5068B, described here.  Espin's positions for IC 5068 and 5070 are good, so IC 5067 is lost without additional information, but Corwin notes that IC 5068B is the brightest nebula in the region that he might have picked up.

Size 30'


18" (9/25/06): IC 5068 is the second of three very large emission nebulae roughly one degree south of the southern end of the Pelican Nebula.  At 113x and an OIII filter, this object appears very large, diffuse, irregular glow, roughly 25'x20'.  It is noticeably brighter in a 12' circular region about 10' N of a mag 7.3 star (HD 198690) and a group of brighter stars that are near the southeast side of the nebula.


To the northwest is a second large patch of nebulosity, generally designated IC 5068B, though if Espin's declination was off by 1.5°, this may be IC 5067.  This piece is very large and elongated NW to SE, extending perhaps 40'x15'.  It contains a bright circular 10' patch to the south of a mag 8 star (SAO 50061).  A broad river of faint nebulosity streams away towards the northwest from this brighter region.


To the east of IC 5068 is the least conspicuous section, dubbed IC 5068C.  This detached piece extends 30'x15' (elongated E-W) and overall has a low surface brightness appearing as a hazy glow.  A mag 6.7 star is at the southwest end and a mag 7 star is at the eastern edge.


Reverend Thomas Espin discovered IC 5068, along with IC 5070, visually on 7 Sep 1899 with a 17 1/4-inch reflector at his Tow Law observatory in England. He simply noted "very faint", but his position is only 6' NW of center of this very large, parallelogram-shaped nebula, so the identification is fairly certain.


Discovered by Espin (AN 3633).  Described simply as "very faint".  The Pelican Nebula is also announced in this short list of 6 objects.  His discovery position is 1 tmin W of the Sky Catalogue 2000.0 position!

Size 80'x70'


18" (7/17/07): The huge Pelican Nebula overfilled the 67' field in the 31 Nagler.  The UHC filter gave a higher contrast than the OIII filter.  Several brighter sections were noted on the close-up chart A1 in the U2000 atlas.  One of the brightest pieces is the "neck" of the Pelican located 20'-25' W of mag 4.8 57 Cygni and collinear with two mag 8/9 stars 10' and 12' due west.  The glow extends 10' in length.  To the SW of the mag 4.8 star is the large "beak" section that streams from NW to SE and extends roughly 20'x8', widening a bit at the SE end.  The west side of the beak is defined by a dark lane that parallels the nebulosity and the large, faint body of the Pelican is west of this lane and includes 5.1-magnitude 56 Cygni (the nebulosity is very weak here).  The brightest section of the body is a large, circular patch at the south end, ~12' diameter, and located 30' SE of 56 Cygni and 55' S of the "neck".


18" (9/25/06): This was the first observation of the Pelican Nebula in quite awhile and I forgot about this huge, interesting emission nebula.  The view was fascinating at 113x with an OIII or UHC filter as this object overfilled the 44' field.  I started exploring to the west of 4.8-magnitude 57 Cygni.  The brightest section is possibly on a line with this star and a mag 7.2 star further east and corresponds with the neck portion on the Pelican.  This is where the ionization front is most evident on photographs.  The elongated "beak" of the Pelican also begins to the west of the bright star and streams off in a wide river of nebulosity towards the southeast and passing out of the field.  A long darker lane apparently free of nebulosity isolates the "neck" from the main body of the Pelican.  The irregular body spreads out to the south of the neck well beyond the southern edge of the eyepiece field and extends at least 65' from the neck terminating at the SE end with a roundish bright patch of nebulosity ~12' in diameter.  The Pelican is located directly west of the North American Nebula and part of the same huge complex of nebulosity in this region (separated by the dark cloud LDN 935).


13.1" (7/5/83): the entire body of the "Pelican" is easily visible at 62x and a UHC filter.  The "head and neck" section is easy to view along with the fainter "bill" and a long body extending from head.  Located west of the North America Nebula in a rich field between two mag 7 stars.


8" (6/22/81): faint, surrounding scattered group of stars at 50x and UHC filter.  Appears as a bright patch to the west of two bright stars (neck section).


Reverend Thomas Espin discovered IC 5070, along with IC 5068, visually on 7 Sep 1899 with a 17 1/4-inch reflector at his Tow Law observatory in England. The discovery was included in a short list of 6 new objects (including the Cocoon Nebula) in AN 3633 and noted as "faint and diffused".  His position corresponds with the "neck" of the Pelican, the brightest part of the nebula, so the identification is certain.


Max Wolf photographed the region surrounding the North American Nebula on 1 Jun 1891 (AN 3048) on a 3 hour plate. He gives a general description of the region with no specific positions, though mentions strong nebulosity was recorded around the stars 56 and 57 Cygni, which are involved in the Pelican Nebula.  So, certainly it was captured on his early image.  Espin is credited with the discovery in the IC2, but Wolf should share credit.

The nebulosity has no regular structure and is of a fleecy character, the margins gradually fading into invisibility."

24" (7/28/19): very similar view as previous notes at 322x.  Visible with direct vision and not difficult to hold continuously.


24" (10/6/18): fairly faint, fairly small, round, ~25" diameter, very small bright nucleus.  The galaxy forms a right angle with a mag 14 star 0.8' W and a mag 14.5 star 1.3' SSE.  This compact CGCG is situated just 32' SE of the center of M15!


Lewis Swift discovered IC 5115 = Sw. XI-205 on 12 Sep 1896 and wrote, "eeF; vS; faint * near f; not [NGC]7068."  There is nothing at his position but nearly 30 seconds of RA east is CGCG 426-060, and this galaxy is taken as IC 5115.  Although a group of at least 8 stars is immediately west, there isn’t a faint star close east that would have drawn his attention.  Secondly, I find it odd that NGC 7068 was mentioned in the description as it is located 1.2° NW, well outside of Swift's field of view.  Finally, CGCG 426-060 has a very low surface brightness and was missed in my 24", I'm skeptical it was picked up by Swift.

21 32 31.0 +44 35 48; Cyg

V = 11.5;  Size 2"


18" (11/17/08): picked up at 175x in a rich star field by blinking with an OIII filter.  Excellent contrast gain using the filter.  Forms the fainter component (V = 11.5) of a "double star" with a mag 10 star 21" ENE, but with the filter the planetary dominates the star.  Interestingly, there is similar double (Es 1339 = 10.8/11.5 at 24") in terms of separation and position angle ~3' NE!  Without a filter at 175x, IC 5117 has a soft, bluish appearance.  Using 450x, a very small 2" disc was clearly visible but it was too small to resolve any structure.


13.1" (8/7/85): appears as mag 11.5 "star" without a filter.  Forms a 20" double with a mag 10 star just east.  Using an OIII filter the planetary is brighter than the star by one magnitude (contrast gain of roughly 2.5 magnitudes).


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 5117 = Fleming 104 in 1905 while classifying stars by examining photographic objective-prism spectra.  A note in the 1905 Harvard College Observatory Circular No. 98 ("Stars Having Peculiar Spectra") simply mentions "this object is exceedingly faint."  Thomas Espin made several visual observations in 1911 with his 17.25" reflector and the "nebula was thought to show a tiny disc."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported IC 5117 was "indistinguishable from a star on the Crossley negatives, but shown to have a minute disk visually with the 36-inch refractor."

Herbert Howe discovered IC 5122 = Ho. II-13 on 17 Sep 1898 and noted "vF, eS.  Near [NGC] 7103 and 7104."  He added a note "No. 13 is in the same field with 7103, 7104, and [IC 5124].

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 5127 = Big. 338 on 27 Oct 1894.  There is nothing at his position.  But Harold Corwin and Courtney Seligman re-reduced his position based on an accurate coordinates of his offset star (BD+5 4837).  The resulting position is just 5 seconds of RA east of NGC 7102, resulting in IC 5127 = NGC 7102.  But, Corwin mentions that "he dates his three measurements to the same night on which he made three measurements of NGC 7102 (these reduce to the correct position)."  So, this requires Bigourdan to have measured the same object twice, once assuming it was new.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5131 = Sw. XI-207, along with IC 5135 = NGC 7130, on 17 Sep 1897 and noted "vF; vS; R."  His position is 5.4' too far southwest, roughly the same offset as XI-208 = IC 5135 and XI-209 = NGC 7135.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate micrometric position (given in the IC2) in 1898-99.

17.5" (10/17/98): IC 5132 and IC 5133 refers to faint nebulosity surrounding a pair of mag 12 stars at 1' separation situated ~5' NNW of NGC 7129 (same complex of reflection nebulae).  It was difficult to verify with certainty as the background sky around six stars arranged in two parallel rows each ~2' in length appears to be weakly glowing.  IC 5132 and 5133 are surrounding the two stars closest to NGC 7129 and the background glow does appear very slightly enhanced around these stars.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 5132 and 5133 on a photograph taken 25 Sep 1895 of NGC 7129. He noted "there are three stara, each about 13th magnitude, surrounded by very faint nebulosity in the positions following, measured from the centre of the tristellar nucleus of the nebula: (1) 358" north following; (2) 326" north preceding; (3) 277" north preceding.  The stars Nos. 2 and 3 are not referred to in Dr. Dreyer's catalogues, and the measurements given above are approximate."  His offsets identify the two stars given here, although Dreyer's positions are offset to the southwest.  Roberts' first object didn't make it into the IC as Dreyer apparently thought it was identical to NGC 7133.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 5134 = Big. 339 on 15 Oct 1895 and noted "star, which appears accompanied by nebulosity located especially opposite 7129."  His position and description clearly applies to the nebulosity around the brightest southern star, as he thought NGC 7129 only applied to one of the northern patches. So, IC 5134 is technically part of NGC 7129.

His position is 4.5' SW of NGC 7130 (John Herschel made a 30' error in declination), close enough that Howe was able to find it in 1898-99 and measure an accurate position (used in the IC 2).

Harold Corwin suggests that Swift found NGC 7135, which is 1.2° south of his position and 1 minute of RA east.   I don't see what stars he had in mind, though, for the "wide D *" that points to the galaxy.   He found the galaxy again just 2 nights later and reported Sw. XI-209 as "eeF; pL; R; 3 B st form a triangle; nf of 2 [with IC 5135 = NGC 7130]."  Herbert Howe reexamined the field in 1899 and realized Swift's #209 was identical to NGC 7135, so Dreyer didn't assign another IC desigation.

CGCG 427-040, just 2.7' ENE, appeared extremely to very faint, small, round, 20" diameter, low even surface brightness.  CGCG 427-040 is misidentified as IC 5144 in MCG, PGC and HyperLeda.  UGC 11845 lies 4.6' ESE.  This difficult edge-on (B = 16.1) appeared extremely faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~20"x10", very low surface brightness! A mag 13 star lies 1.3' SE.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5144, along with IC 5145, on 30 Jul 1888 and described in his notebook, "1 outer radius + 1 thickness [of Ring micrometer] = 7' 17" south and 17 seconds +/- preceding this nebula [IC 5145] is a small faint neb close preceding several small stars." Dreyer was notified privately of both of these discoveries.  Very close to Barnard's offset from IC 5145 is the brightest galaxy of 4 within 3', which matches his description. MCG, PGC, and HyperLeda (as of late 2015) misidentify CGCG 427-040 as IC 5144 (though has an uncertain symbol).  See Harold Corwin's notes for more.

17.5" (8/8/91): at 82x using an H-Beta filter, the Cocoon Nebula appears fairly bright, very large, about 10' diameter.  Surrounds six stars including two bright mag 9-10 stars embedded near the center and at the south edge.  Has an irregular round shape with a very irregular surface brightness with dark mottling and brighter regions.  The nebula is quite prominent using an H-Beta filter, which gives an excellent contrast gain (higher than OIII). The nebulous glow is superimposed on a scattered star group and is situated at the east end of long dark lane = B168 which extends 1° WNW! (excellent in binoculars).  There is a distinctive edge to the Milky Way on the north edge of lane.


8" (8/12/83): about 20 stars over a very faint "milky" region, fairly large, just slightly higher contrast than Milky Way background.  A short arc of stars is off the west edge.  A long starless dark lane extends west.  Two bright stars oriented N-S are just east.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5146 = Cocoon Nebula on a photograph taken 11 Oct 1893 using the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.  Max Wolf also photographed the field on 28 Jul 1894 with the 6-inch camera at Königstuhl.  Wolf announced his discovery with a photograph taken on 10 Jul 1904 and discussed the dark lane (Barnard 168) and nebulosity in detail in his paper "Remarkable nebula in Cygnus" (MNRAS, 64, 838,1904).


Mary Clerke, who was in correspondence with Wolf at the time, includes Wolf's 1904 photograph (plate XX) in her second edition (1905) of "The System of the Stars".  She labeled the photograph "The Cocoon Nebula in Cygnus" and writes (p. 352) "The depicted nebula, which had been discovered ten years previously, is about 10' in diameter, of a round shape, and a complex structure.  "It is placed centrally," Dr. Wolf writes, "in a very fine lacuna void of faint stars, which surrounds the luminous cloud like a trench."  Moreover, this negative "halo forms the end of a long channel, running eastward from the western nebulous clouds and their lucanae, to a length of more the two degrees."  The coexistence in the same sidereal district of nebulae and stars could not well be asserted with stronger emphasis than by clearly of a dark fosse for the accommodation of the cocoon-like object in Plate XX."  I tracked down the nickname after a discussion on AMASTRO in August 2015.


The Reverend Thomas Espin discovered the nebula visually on 13 Aug 1899 and described object #6 in AN [3633] 152, 141 as a "large, faint glow about 8', well seen each night [2]."  Espin and Wolf is credited with the discovery in the IC.


Dave Riddle notes that B168 could apply to both the bright nebula and the associated dark lane. Barnard refers to a "small nebula at the E end of dark lane. This nebula is 10' in diameter with over a dozen stars of different magnitudes in it. There is no central condensation, nor does the nebula condense about any of the stars. There are some dark markings in it. The dark lane is 1.7 degrees long and 9' wide."

Contains a very easy central star, which seemed quite easy for mag 16.3-16.5.  The annulus appeared mottled and irregular in brightness.  A 60° arc along the NW portion of the annulus is slightly brighter and a 90° arc from SE to NE is much brighter and a little thicker.  A mag 10.5 star is off the SSW side (1.9' from center), but no superimposed stars were seen.

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, this beautiful planetary appears as a large round ring, nearly 2' diameter, with a bright, thick annulus that is irregularly lit.  The rim is slightly brighter and thicker along the SE side and also appeared slightly enhanced on the NW side.  The central hole appears 25"-30" diameter and is dark except for a central star that was intermittently visible with averted vision at 228x unfiltered, although the catalogued magnitude is 16.5!  Good contrast enhancement with a UHC filter.  A mag 10.5 is off the SSW side, 1.8' from the center.

Walter Gale, an amateur from Sydney, discovered IC 5150 on 4 Jun 1894 with his 8.5-inch reflector from Paddington and it was reported in the B.A.A. Vol VI, No. 5 (p218) in 1895.  He described it as just visible in a 6-inch reflector and a 5-inch refractor.  Using his new 10-inch reflector, it spanned 45"x35" N-S with the central vacancy less than half the diameter and not entirely dark.  He also commented it was remarkable that such a relatively bright object was overlooked by John Herschel.


Lewis Swift independently found this planetary on 23 July 1897 on Echo Mountain in southern California and recorded Sw. XII-29 (later IC 5148) as "vF, L, lE, 2 B st point to it, nearest in contact."  Swift's position was 30 sec of RA too small.  By priority, the primary designation should be IC 5150 (from Gale), although it is generally known as IC 5148 or IC 5148-50.  Baracchi observed it using the Great Melbourne Telescope and described the planetary as almost circular, ~1.5' diameter, not quite dark in the central portion.

21 59 35.1 -39 23 08; Gru

V = 11.0;  Size 120"


48" (10/23/14): beautiful, large annular planetary at 375x, round, roughly 2' diameter, with a relatively thick annulus and a 30" central dark hole.  Contains a very easy central star, which seems brighter than mag 16.5.  The annulus is mottled and irregular in brightness.  A 60° arc along the NW portion of the annulus is slightly brighter and a 90° arc from SE to NE is much brighter and a little thicker.  A mag 10.5 star is off the SSW side (1.9' from center), but there are no superimposed stars.


18" (8/30/08): viewed from Lake Sonoma at a very low elevation, though in a dark portion of the southern sky.  Beautiful view at 115x using an OIII filter as a 2' annular ring with a relatively thick rim and 30" central hole.  A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW side (1.8' from the center).


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, this beautiful planetary appears as a large round ring, nearly 2' diameter, with a bright, thick annulus that is irregularly lit.  The rim is slightly brighter and thicker along the SE side and also appeared slightly enhanced on the NW side.  The central hole appears 25"-30" diameter and is dark except for a central star that was intermittently visible with averted vision at 228x unfiltered, although it is listed with a magnitude of 16.5!  Good contrast enhancement with a UHC filter.  A mag 10.5 is off the SSW side, 1.8' from the center.


17.5" (10/30/99): Even at -39° declination, this moderately large planetary is a beautiful annular ring at 100x with an OIII filter.  Appears round, ~100" diameter, the annulus has an irregular surface brightness.  The central "hole" is perhaps 25" in diameter and fairly dark.  A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW edge.


17.5" (8/20/88): perfect annular 2' ring visible at 82x using an OIII filter.  A mag 10.5 star is just off the SSW edge 1.8' from the center.  The ring-shape is clearly visible with direct vision.


17.5" (7/22/87): beautiful ring at 140x with an OIII filter.  Appears fairly large, fairly bright with a mag 11 star off the south edge.


13.1" (8/17/85): fairly faint with OIII at 79x, fairly large.  Appears clearly annular with averted vision.  The central hole is possibly elongated N-S. A mag 11 star is off the south edge.  Similar view on 7/20/85.

11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): at 127x appeared moderately bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 ~E-W, roughly 2.5'x1.3', broad weak concentration to a slightly brighter core.  A 7.7-magnitude star (HD 209142) is superimposed just north of the west end of the galaxy and somewhat hinders the view.  With averted vision the glow appears to extend slightly west of the bright star and the core is just a small brightening to the east of the star.


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this nearby Irregular galaxy (probably just outside the Local Group) was viewed at 171x and 228x.  It appeared bright, large, elongated 2:1 ~WNW-ESE, ~3'x1.5'.  A mag 7.9 star (HD 209142) is perched on the NW end and detracts from viewing.  It's very surprising that John Herschel missed this galaxy as it is quite large and relatively prominent.  Gradually concentrated to a brighter 45" core.


DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 5152 = DS 732 on a plate taken in 1899 at Harvard's Arequipa station in Peru.  He noted "F, cL, cE at 150°, cbM."  This galaxy is often listed as a Local Group member though is likely outside the Local Group.

24" (8/1/19): at 260x; faint, moderately large, extremely thin edge-on, nearly 10:1 NNW-SSE, ~0.9'x0.1', can hold steadily with averted.  Forms an equilateral triangle with two mag 14.5/14.8 stars 1.7' NE and ESE.  Located 5' NNE of NGC 7214 and faintest in the HCG 91 quartet. Modern catalogues identify ESO 467-011 as IC 5168.


ESO 467-011, located 5.6' SW of NGC 7214, was a threshold object and popped a couple of times at 220x as a thin edge-on, ~5:1 NW-SE.

17.5" (10/13/90): extremely faint, small, edge-on NNW-SSE, can just hold steadily with averted.  Located 5.1' NNE of NGC 7214 in HCG 91.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 5168 = Sw. XI-211 on 31 Aug 1897 and reported in his 11th discovery list, "eeF; vS; vE; [right] ∆ with 2 F st."  In his earlier third discovery list from Lowe, he also noted the 2 faint stars were near south-following.  His position falls near the southeast tip of ESO 467-011, a faint edge-on, which all sources (ESO, MCG, PGC, NED, HyperLEDA, SIMBAD) take as IC 5168 based on the very good positional match.  But there aren't two faint stars close southeast matching his description or in any other direction that he likely would have seen.  Instead, in Aug 2019 I proposed to Harold Corwin that ESO 465-015 = HCG 91B, about 10' NE of Swift's position, was a better candidate.  This galaxy is a brighter edge-on with two mag 14.5 stars less than 2' NE and SE forming an equilateral triangle.  He agrees with this identification.


ESO 467-011 was found on a plate taken between 1914-1916 with the 30" Reynolds reflector at the Helwan Observatory.  It was reported as #242 in a list of 256 new nebulae published in 1921 and described as "pF, 1' long, spindle, mE 170°, lbM."

Lewis Swift found IC 5179 = Sw. XII-33 on 26 Jul 1897 and reported "vF, L, R, * close S, B * sp".  There is nothing at his position but 3 minutes of time further east is IC 5184, which Swift discovered just a week earlier and which also has a poor RA (off by 40 seconds).  In addition, IC 5183 is a third "discovery" by Swift just two months later. This happened during his last year at observing at Lowe Observatory when numerous errors occurred in descriptions and positions.  So, IC 5179 = IC 5183 = IC 5184.  See IC 5184 for more.


This galaxy was correctly identified in the Helwan Observatory Bulletin for 1935, despite the very poor position, and described as "1.5'x0.5', E 65°, spiral of the "S" type, with pF central region 1'x 0.25', lE 40°, no nucleus, very little absorption and condensation on the preceding side."

Joseph Lunt discovered IC 5181 visually around 1900, during a search for Brorsen's Comet with the 18-inch f/15 refractor at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.  IC 5181 is generally attached to ESO 289-001 = PGC 68317, though Lunt's RA is nearly 1 minute greater and his declination 7' further north, closer to fainter NGC 7232A.  But since PGC 68317 is much brighter, the identification is probably more likely.  This galaxy was found again on Bruce plates taken from Arequipa, Peru and reported as new in the list of 1659 nebulae published in Volume 72 of the Annals of the Harvard College Observatory (1913).

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5184 = Sw. XII-35 on 19 Jul 1897 and recorded "pF, pS, lE, bet 2 st in meridian, 8 1/2m star sp, np of 2 [with IC 5186]."  His RA was 40 seconds of time too small, but he clearly observed ESO 405-005 based on his detailed description.  Swift found this galaxy again just a week later and recorded Sw. XII-33 (later IC 5179) as "vF, L, R, * close S, B * sp", but his RA was 3 minutes too small.  Finally, he "rediscovered" this galaxy two months later on 20 Sep 1897 and described Sw. XII-34 (later IC 5183) as "pB, C, [sic] S, F * in contact sf, sev pB st form segment of large circle."  On the third observation his declination was 1° too far north.  So, IC 5179 = IC 5183 = IC 5184, all announced in his 12th (and last) discovery paper.   DeLisle Stewart also found it on a Harvard plate at Arequipa and reported "cB, S, cE at 40°, Spiral?"  He mistakenly assumed it was Sw. XII-36 = IC 5186, as Swift's position coincidentally matches this galaxy, otherwise it might have a fourth designation.

ESO 405-007 is 2.5 minutes of RA east and 2.5' north of Swift's position but a much better fit in description.  Swift's positions were generally very poor in his last two lists, so the large discrepancy in RA is not unusual.

Strongly concentrated with a large elongated bar oriented SSW-NNE (over 1' in length) within a brighter core. The bar dominates a much fainter diffuse outer halo of low surface brightness.  Still, there was a suggestion of spiral structure in the outer halo on the SSW and NNE ends.


A giant HII complex/OB association stood out on the SW side of the halo [1.5' SSW of center] as a small knot.  It appeared fairly faint, roundish, 12"-15" diameter, stellar or quasi-stellar nucleus.


Located 19' WSW of mag 6.4 Pi-1 and 23' WSW of mag 5.6 mag Pi-2 Gruis.  The pair is a nice binocular double at a wide 4' separation.  Pi-1 is a red giant transitioning into a carbon star and a very unequal double star (mag 6.5/10.7 at 2.8").


Joseph Lunt discovered IC 5201 visually in 1900 during a search for Brorsen's Comet.  He was observing with the 18-inch refractor of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.  Lunt's position was 22 seconds of RA too large and 2' too far south.

Lewis Swift found IC 5204 = Sw. XI-212 on 8 Aug 1896 and reported "vF, eE, a ray, p[receding] of 2."  There is nothing near his position, but Harold Corwin suggests this number is probably a duplicate of NGC 7300.  Swift's "f[ollowing] of 2" is IC 5228, which is a good match with NGC 7302 in position and description.  His comment "eE, a ray" fits NGC 7300, which is 21.5' WNW of NGC 7302 (within Swift's 33' field), though this implies he made a 10 minute error in time (too small), as well as nearly a 25' error in declination!

18" (7/2/08): picked up easily at 174x as a "soft" mag 11.5 with a pale blue color.  Good contrast gain blinking with an OIII filter.  A brighter mag 10 comparison star lies 1.8' S but blinking with the filter the planetary switches apparent brightness with this star.  At 435x, IC 5217 appeared as a 7"x5" blue disc, slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  With direct vision, a slightly brighter quasi-stellar center was visible suggesting the central star was just below the threshold of visibility.


18" (12/08/07): picked up at 115x as a soft blue-grey "star".  Good contrast gain using a NPB filter.  Without a filter, a brighter mag 10 star lies to the south though with the filter the planetary matches the star.  At 225x a definite small disc was visible, crisp-edged, round, ~6" diameter.  The seeing was too soft to use high power.


13.1" (10/10/86): at 166x appears fairly bright but just non-stellar.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  A bright compact bluish disc is visible at 214x, slightly elongated.  Estimate V = 11.5 and 5" diameter.  Located 1.3° due south of mag 4.4 Beta Lac.


8": stellar planetary at 100x, slightly fuzzy at 220x and an easy ellipse is visible at 400x.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 5217 = Fleming 102 in 1904 based on its emission line spectrum on a Harvard  plate.  Several visual observations were made by Thomas Espin in 1911 with his 17.25" reflector and he estimated the size from 2.5" to 4" in diameter and "apparently elongated N and S."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported "no central star can be distinguished.  A bright oval about 7.5"x6" in a 5 min exposure; slightly larger and quite "square-shouldered" in the long exposure.  Brighter along the middle, but no details of structure can be made out."

Lewis Swift found IC 5225 = Sw.

Although nothing is at his position, NGC 7294 is 36 seconds of RA further east and 2' S, and his detailed description matches (specifically "4 st np a curve, one D[ouble]".  So clearly IC 5225 = NGC 7294.


Harold Corwin notes that "ESO suggested that I5225 might be ESO 533-G039 = MCG -04-53-007, or that it might be ESO 533-G025 = MCG -04-52-045."  MCG list -04-53-007 as IC 5225?

There is nothing at his position, but his RA for IC 5225 was 36 seconds of time too small (not an unusual error at the end of his career at age 77).  It's reasonable to assume a similar offset for IC 5226, though there is nothing near this offset position.  But Harold Corwin found that if Swift made another error of exactly 1° in declination (too far north), this corrected position matches ESO 533-045.  Furthermore, the nearest star is about 4' away ("no * nr") and there are 4 stars to the southeast (including two 9th magnitude) matching his comment "trapezium".  ESO, MCG and PGC don't assign IC 5226 to ESO 533-045, but NED and HyperLeda follow Corwin.


ESO 533-045 was discovered again on a plate taken between 1914-1916 with the 30" Reynolds reflector at the Helwan Observatory.  It was reported as #248 in a list of 256 new nebulae published in 1921 and described as "F, pS, star surr. by atmosphere, another star 12 mag follows 40", edge of plate."

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5239 = Sw. XI-216 on 7 Jul 1897 and wrote, "vF; pS; R."  There is nothing anywhere near his position that he might have seen.  The ESO and PGC label ESO 345-038 (an interacting pair) as IC 5239.  Although this galaxy is only 2' from Swift's nominal position, Harold Corwin notes that this galaxy is much too faint to have been seen by Swift and I agree.  He suggests that Swift made a 10 minute error in RA (too large) and that ESO 345-017 is IC 5239.  Although a much better candidate, I feel this galaxy may still be too faint to have been noticed by Swift.  Perhaps he picked up ESO 345-021, a brighter galaxy that is exactly 8 minutes of RA (west) from Swift's position.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5264 = Sw. XI-219 on 15 Dec 1889.  He found this galaxy while measuring IC 1459 (discovered 2 nights earlier) with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  Barnard wrote in his logbook, "a small faint neb'y about 4' S and 1' p this neb [IC 1459].  Small and elong in parallel nearly [~E-W]."  No accurate offsets were measured, but this clearly applies to IC 5264.  As this entry was not published or passed along to Dreyer, Barnard never received discovery credit.


Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy on 10 Jun 1896 and described Sw. XI-219 (later IC 5264) as "vF; S; eeE; a ray; sp of below st; sp of 2 [with IC 1459 = IC 5265]."  His position is 0.2 min of RA too small and 3.5' too far south (same error in dec as IC 5265).  Curiously, he gave the discovery date as 2 Sep 1896 in his first Lowe Observatory discovery list and 4 Sep 1897 in his third Lowe discovery list (he made a number of mistakes on discovery dates and of course positions during his last observing year).  Ironically, Swift mentioned "I am glad I have at length found in Barnard's field a nebula his keen eye failed to see", though it turns out that wasn't the case!


Interestingly, earlier in March 1896 he wrote a short article in Popular Astronomy titled "The Lowe Observatory" and mentioned "Near some of Sir John Herschel’s southern nebulae I have discovered several overlooked by him, notably, one between [NGC 7418] and [NGC 7421], in field with the latter.  It is very faint, very small, exceedingly elongated to a ray five times as long as broad.  I am surprised at his failure to see it."   There is nothing between these galaxies, but assuming he confused the identifications of the nearby galaxies his description may apply to IC 5264!


In a 1912 report on observations of nebulae made at the Helwan Observatory between 1909-1911, Harold Knox-Shaw reported - due to Swift's poor position - there was nothing at the position for IC 5264 on photos taken with the 30" reflector and reported it as new (possibly equivalent to IC 5264).

Lewis Swift found IC 5265 = Sw. XI-220 on 16 Jun 1896 and reported "B, cL, R, betw 2 stars p and f; nf of 2 [with IC 5264].  There is nothing at his position but 25 seconds of RA west and 4' N is IC 1459 and the description matches. Swift mentioned his object "may possibly be = no. 1459 in Dreyer's Index Catalogue" in a footnote to his discovery list at Lowe Observatory.  The date of his observation is unclear; the big 11th list gives 16 Jun 1896 but his first discovery at Lowe (in AJ) gives 2 Sep 1896. Corwin notes that Dreyer questioned if IC 5265 might be identical to NGC 7418, but it's not.

Finlay's discovery (with no description) wasn't published until 1898 and he credited Swift in the table of nebulae (MNRAS 58, 329).  Dreyer gave Finlay primary credit in the IC.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5269 = Sw. XI-222 on 10 Sep 1896 and reported "vF; pS; R; np of 2 [with IC 5270]."  His position is 10 seconds of RA west and 6' north of ESO 406-032 = PGC 70110, not unusual for his later IC positions.  Swift confused the orientation as IC 5269 is the south-preceding of the pair, though the discovery dates are a month apart so the positions were perhaps recorded on different nights.  Furthermore, Swift gave the discovery date of IC 5269 and 5270 as 2 Sep 1896 in his first Lowe Observatory list (in AJ) and 4 Sep in this third Lowe list (probably different observations).  MCG reverses the identifications of IC 5269 and IC 5270.

13.1" (7/20/85): faint, edge-on ~E-W, even surface brightness.  Otherwise similar in size and brightness to IC 5269 11' SSW.  The IC orientation for the pair is incorrect.  This galaxy is the furthest north in a string of ~10 galaxies stretching south to IC 5273.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 5270 = Sw. XI-223 on 12 Aug 1896 and recorded "vF; pS; vE; sf of 2 [with IC 5269]."  His position is 14' too far south and IC 5270 is the north-following of 2.  According to Swift's large AN table, he discovered nearby IC 5269 a month later, though the pair would have both been in his 33' field.  Furthermore, the discovery date is given as 4 Sep 1897 in his earlier 3rd list of nebulae from Lowe Observatory.  He probably added the comment "sf of 2" when preparing the table for publication.  MCG reverses the identifications of IC 5269 and IC 5270, probably because Swift's position for IC 5269 is 10' north of IC 5270 .


E.E. Barnard probably made an earlier observation of IC 5270 and IC 5269 on 15 Dec 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He recorded in his logbook, "pL, vF, extended, a small, faint __ (can't decipher word) 5' +/- S.  A 6m star 22' N and 1' following."  There is nothing at his position (in ink), but his declination is just 3' off from IC 5270 and the galaxy 5' +/- south is probably IC 5269.  The 6th mag star HD 217096 is 22' NNE of IC 5270, though 8' following.  Barnard never published these discoveries or informed Dreyer, so Swift is credited in the IC.

NGC 7520 is listed as nonexistent in most sources.  Harold Corwin suggests the possibility that NGC 7520 is equivalent to IC 5290 (described above).

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 7520, discovered by Wilhelm Tempel in 1876 may be identical to IC 5290.  There is nothing near his rough position (given only to the nearest min of time and noted as very uncertain "::").  This would require that Tempel's declination to be 20' too far south, though the RA is less than a minute off.  Still this identification is very uncertain and PGC uses IC 5290 as the designation (HyperLeda gives IC 5290 as the primary and NGC 7520 as a secondary designation).

17.5" (9/14/85): faint, very elongated SSW-NNE.  A mag 14 star is at the south edge 22" from the center.  Located 7' NW of NGC 7611 in the Pegasus I cluster.


13.1" (9/22/84): very faint, very small, elongated 5:2 ~N-S.  Low surface brightness and requires averted vision.  A faint star is off the south end.  Similar size to NGC 7611 7' SE.


13.1" (11/5/83): very faint, diffuse, faint stellar nucleus.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 5309 = J. 3-1445 on 23 Oct 1903 and recorded "Faint, elongated fan-shaped, a mag 14 almost in contact to the south, ~30", no condensation."  He reversed the sign of the polar distance offset from his reference star, so the IC position is in error.  Once corrected it's a perfect match with UGC 12498.


Based on photographs taken between 1914-1916 with the 24-inch Yerkes reflector, Hubble described IC 5309 as "pF, mbB, E 0°, 50" x 30", *14m on south edge."

Lewis Swift found IC 5313 = Sw. XI-228 on 8 Aug 1897 and noted, "eeeF; pL; R; 10m * near sp."   His RA was 14 seconds too small and the dec 1.7' too far south but the comment "10m * nr south-preceding" clinches the identity IC 5313 = NGC 7632.  In his third discovery list from Lowe Observatory (in Popular Astronomy), he added "11m * f[ollows the 10m star].


Based on a photograph taken with the 30" reflector at the Helwan observatory, it was reported (1921): "No nebula here except NGC 7632"

James Dunlop probably discovered IC 5332 = D 546? on 14 Jul 1826.  He reported finding an "extremely feeble nebula, ill defined; it appears rather elongated oblique to the equator; it is north following a star of the 7th magnitude, and also north of the small stars."  His position is 1° south and 1 minute of RA east of IC 5332, but a 7th magnitude is 13' SW matching his description and a group stars is close southwest.  This identification was suggested by Glen Cozens in his analysis of Dunlop's discoveries.


Lewis Swift independently discovered IC 5332 = Sw. XI-233 on 19 Nov 1897 and reported "eeeF; vL; bet 2 st; D[ouble] * p[recedes] 45 sec little s[outh]; pentagon p[receding]."  The double is the unequal double SEE 489, mentioned in my observation.  This object was first reported in his 5th discovery list from Lowe Observatory in which he has the note, "..it is a remarkable object.  It appears to be a nebulous nebula, if such an expression be allowable.  Its appearance was as if a central, considerably elongated nebula with sharp outlines, was centrally superimposed on another nebula very much larger, and of unimagined faintness.  It was impossible, the seeing being excellent, to assign limits to the outer envelope.  It is the largest and among the faintest of all my nebulas. I have requested the Director of the Lick Observatory to examine it with the 36-inch telescope."  Swift was credited with the discovery in the IC.


IC 5332 was first recognized on a Helwan Observatory plate taken between 1914-16 by Harold Knox-Shaw.

Herbert Howe discovered IC 5349 = Ho. II-15 on 16 Nov 1898 and recorded "vF, vmE 200°, 20" long."  His position and description is an exact match.  He also added the note "No. 15 has puzzled me somewhat.  The southern end is the brightest portion, and at times it seems as if the object were really a faint double star, one or both components of which are nebulous."  He was right about this object being double!

This star has a companion of mag 12 at 70°, 6"."  Howe's accurate position was used in the IC.  Swift probably discovered this galaxy again on 24 Jul 1897 and reported Sw. XII-45 (later IC 5363) as "vF, eS, R, 3 st in line p[receding], one D[ouble]."  His position is a fairly poor fit; 18' SE of IC 5362 (not unusual in his last summer of observing).

E.E.

17.5" (10/4/97): very faint, very small, round, 25" diameter, weak concentration.  Second brightest in the IC 5370 group.  Situated between two mag 12.5 stars 2.1' W and 2.7' E.  Also 6' SW of a mag 9.1 star. IC 5370 lies 5' SW.  This is a contact double system, although I probably only viewed the brighter western component.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 5373 = J. 3-1464, along with IC 5369, 5370, 5371 and 5372, on 9 Nov 1899.  He recorded "pretty bright, round, 20", mag 13 stellar nucleus."  MCG doesn't label its +05-01-019 as IC 5373.  The CGCG magnitude includes both components.

24" (12/1/16): fairly faint, small, round, 15"-18" diameter, slightly brighter nucleus.  A 20" pair of mag 14.5 stars is off the west side.  MCG +03-01-016, a very low surface brightness companion adjacent to the north [30" between centers], was not seen.


18" (11/14/09): faint, small, round, 20" diameter, two mag 14 stars [23" separation] are close preceding [nearer star is 30" west].  A much fainter companion (MCG +03-01-016 = PGC 178) attached on the north side was not seen.  Located 30' NNW of NGC 7814.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 5378, along with IC 5377 and 5379, on a plate taken on 17 Nov 1895 of NGC 7814.  He described IC 5378 as "Faint; elongated north to south; one of three 15th mag stars involved; condensation at the north extremity; length including the star about 42"."  His position is 1.3' too far south (same as IC 5379), but his description is very accurate (except the involved mag 15 star is the nucleus).

13.1" (10/10/86): very faint, small, very elongated 3:1 SW-NE.  Located just NW of a small isosceles triangle of mag 12-13 stars with side about 1' with the closest star 43" SE.  Can just hold steadily with averted.  Forms a pair with NGC 7814 10' N.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 5381 = J. 3-1468, along with IC 5377 and 5378, on a plate taken with his 20-inch reflector on 17 Nov 1895 of NGC 7814.  He described IC 5381 as "Bright; elongated north following to south preceding about 50"; stellar nucleus about 17th mag; four 12 to 16 stars on the south near it."  It was found again by Keeler or Perrine between 1898-00 on plates taken with the Crossley reflector and catalogued as #740 in a table of 744 new nebulae published in 1908.  Finally, Stephane Javelle rediscovered it visually at the Nice Observatory on 12 Nov 1903 while measuring NGC 7814 and recorded it as #1468 in his third discovery list.

17.5" (11/6/93): very faint, very small, round, weak concentration, can just steadily with direct vision.  A mag 13 star is 3' NW.  Located 12' ESE of mag 8.2 SAO 147055.  The listed magnitude appears too bright.


Herbert Howe found IC 5384 in 1899-00 while searching for NGC 7813 with the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.  He reported "I do not find anything in the NGC place of this Muller nebula.  But 55 seconds following, at nearly the same declination, I found a similar object, elongated, however at 160°, while Muller puts the elongation at 80°.  He says "*8.5 f 38 seconds," while I found such a star preceding 49 seconds.  He also says "*9 np 40 seconds."  There are two such stars about 8' north, and a few seconds preceding.  The region may well be examined with a larger telescope."


Dreyer noted the possible equivalence with NGC 7813 in the IC description and Harold Corwin concludes "NGC 7813 is probably identical with IC 5384, though the descriptions do not match, and Muller's position is a typically poor one from the second Leander McCormick list in AJ."  MCG labels this galaxy IC 5384 as this designation is secure.

Lewis Swift found IC 5386 = Sw. XI-1 on 12 Sep 1896 and logged "pB; pS; vE."  His position is 5' southeast of NGC 7832.   The IC position (based on Herbert Howe's observation in 1898-99) matches NGC 7832.  Corwin notes that neither Swift, Dreyer nor Howe noticed the equivalence with NGC 7832.
