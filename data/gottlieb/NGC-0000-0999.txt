Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 1 on 30 Sep 1861 while testing the 11-inch f/17.5 Merz refractor of the Copenhagen Observatory, though he missed nearby NGC 2.  This was his first deep sky discovery, though d'Arrest was uncertain if his object was identical to h4 or h5 (both of which refer to NGC 16).  He described (combination of 4 observations) NGC 1 as "faint, small, round, 20", no concentration.  In a straight line connecting two stars 11 and 14 mag."  Herman Schultz also observed NGC 1 three times in 1866 and 1868 with a 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala and also missed fainter NGC 2.  The NGC 1 and 2 visual pair are not physically related. NGC 1 lies at a distance of ~200 million l.y. with NGC 2 at roughly 320 million l.y.

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 2 on 20 Aug 1873 using Lord Rosse's 72-inch and recorded a "vF companion [to NGC 1] south".  Dreyer confirmed the observation on 29 Oct 1877 Dreyer and noted, "Nova 2' ssf easily seen, vF, eS stellar."  NGC 2 was missed by both d'Arrest, who discovered NGC 1 with an 11-inch refractor, and Herman Schultz, who observed NGC 1 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6 = Sw. II-3 on 20 Sept 1885 with the 16" Clark refractor at Warner Observatory and recorded "eF; cE; vS; one of 5 stars which point to it is pretty near."  There is nothing at his position, but 75 seconds of RA east and 47' north is NGC 20 = UGC 84.  The RA offset is shared by several other objects discovered this night (NGC 19, 21, 7831, 7836) though the declination error is much larger (8' for the other objects).  But his description matches the chain of five stars just following NGC 20.  So, it is nearly certain NGC 6 = NGC 20 (discovered by R.J. Mitchell using LdR's 72" on 18 Sep 1857). The RNGC misidentifies NGC 6 as NGC 7831. See Corwin's notes for more info.

He described it as fainter than NGC 9 (found 2 nights earlier) and placed it 3' northwest (10 sec of RA west and 1' north).  At this exact separation is a fairly close, faint double star at 00 08 46 +23 50 16 (2000) with components mag 15.3/16.5. MCG misidentifies MCG +04-01-030 as NGC 8.

William Herschel probably discovered NGC 16 = H IV-15 = h4 = h5 on 8 Sep 1784.  He recorded "Stellar, or rather like a faint star with a small chevelure and two burs [sic].  F, S." His RA is 1 min 24 seconds east (using a different star Corwin found an error of 1 min 6 seconds) of UGC 80.  JH observed this object on 5 Sep 1828 and logged "pB; R; bM; 30" (? if not IV. 15)"  Due to the difference in position he wasn't sure if his object was new, but listed it as a Nova.  JH swept the area again 11 nights later and found h5, which he assumed was his father's IV-15: "a star 15m with a burr, RA from Cat.", though without an RA the identification of h5 is unknown.  In the NGC, Dreyer equates h4 = h5 = H IV-15 = NGC 16 and Corwin favors this interpreation. Wolfgang Steinicke feels H IV-15 more likely applies to NGC 22 than NGC 16.  His RA is off by 40 sec (too far east) and 7' too far south and the description "F, S, Stellar, or rather like a faint star with a small chevelure and two burs." may be a better fit.

Muller's position was 2.0 min of RA west of PGC 781 (typical error found in Leander McCormick observations) and his description of the nearby double star 2' west clinches the identification.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 19 = Sw. II-4 on 20 Sep 1885 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory. His description reads, "eeF; lE; in [the] center of 3 vF st forming an equilateral triangle, two of them double."  There is no obvious candidate at Swift's position but 74 seconds of RA east and 8' north is UGC 98.  Similar offsets in RA and Dec yield identities for NGC 21, 7831 and 7836, all discovered the same night (NGC 6 also shares the same offset in RA).  Furthermore, his description of the surrounding stars matches this galaxy.  Hermann Kobold suggested this identification when he measured its position in 1898 at Strasbourg with the 18-inch refractor.  Heber Curtis found it again on a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector in 1912-13 and reported it as new ("not noted in the NGC).


NGC 19 is mislabeled as NGC 21 in RNGC, PGC and UGC (and software Megastar) and not assigned a NGC designation in MCG and CGCG.  Finally, RNGC misclassifies NGC 19 as nonexistent because of the error in Swift's position.  See Corwin's Notes.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 20 using Lord Rosse's 72" on 18 Sep 1857 and recorded as "S; R; pB; bM").  Although no position was measured it was catalogued as GC 6 (Rosse nova) and later by Dreyer as NGC 20.  Herman Schultz independently found the galaxy on 16 Oct 1866 with the 9.6" refractor at Uppsala and it was entered by Dreyer in the GC Supplement as GC 5086, though Dreyer added the comment "Query = GC 6".  Schultz's micrometric position matches UGC 84.


Lewis Swift later independently found this galaxy on 20 Sept 1885 and published it in List II-3.  Based on this entry this galaxy was catalogued as NGC 6, but Swift's position for the galaxy was 1.1 tmin W and 47' S of UGC 84.  Swift's RA offset is identical, though, to the error in his positions for NGC 19, NGC 21, NGC 7831, NGC 7836 all found the same evening.  Although the dec error is large, his description ("one of 5 st which point to it is p nr") matches the chain of 5 stars just following, so NGC 6 is a duplicate of NGC 20 (primary designation).

William Herschel possibly discovered this galaxy on 8 Sep 1784 (H IV-15, sweep 260) and recorded "F, S, Stellar, or rather like a faint star with a small chevelure and two burs."  His position is poor -- 40 sec too far east and 7' too far south -- but the description is a reasonable fit.  Dreyer assumed the observation referred to NGC 16, which is 1 min 25 sec of RA to the west and he commented in the NGC notes "Some error in recording the transit, probably simply of 1 min; reductions correct."

48" (10/23/14): this showpiece, annular planetary was observed unfiltered (low-excitation) at both 488x and 813x and a remarkable amount of detail was visible.  The main section of NGC 40 is nearly round and 0.7' in diameter but outer extensions on the north and south ends increase the dimensions to roughly 1.0'x0.8' SSW-NNE.  The darker interior surrounding the blazing mag 11.5 central star (WC8-type carbon Wolf-Rayet) has a very uneven surface brightness and is slightly darker to the southwest of the central star.


The irregular rim in much brighter along fairly narrow N-S strips on the west and east side.  The western rim is the brighter one and somewhat patchy with a slightly darker notch to the south of its center.  At its north end is a small, faint extension. The rim is more uniform in brightness on the eastern side.


A very faint, thin outer loop curls north and west at its north end of the main disc!  A small, detached, elongated patch floats near its north edge, but slightly south of the tip of the outer loop to its east. A very faint star or stellar knot is involved in this patch.


The rim is very weak on the south side and an easy star is at the southwest end.  A faint, very small detached piece was easily visible at the southern extremity [32" SSW of the central star] of NGC 40.  This patch forms the eastern vertex of a small triangle with a star ~10" NW (noted earlier) and a fainter star 10" SE.


17.5" (12/30/99): at 100x appeared (unfiltered) as a slightly elongated, moderately bright disc surrounding a bright mag 11.5 central star. A slightly fainter mag 12 star lies 1.0' SW.  This is a low excitation PN with an OIII/H-beta ratio of just 0.4 and at 100x there was a noticeable enhancement using the H-beta filter, while it dimmed with an OIII filter.  At 220x, a star was intermittently visible at the SW edge and the PN was slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  The UHC filter gave the best response at this power.  The surface brightness appeared irregular -- darker around the central star and slightly brighter along the west and east side of the rim.  At 280x, the faint star I noted earlier was barely off the SW edge and the PN was weakly annular with a brighter rim along the west and east side and a darker center.  The SW and NE ends of the halo were clearly weaker, though.  380x provided a nice view with subtle irregularities in the interior.

William Herschel discovered NGC 40 = H IV-58 = h8 on 25 Nov 1788 (sweep 886) and recorded, "a star about 9th mag, surrounded with vF milky nebulosity; other stars of the same size are perfectly clear from that appearance. The star is either not round or double; but I am in the north and above the pole, I could not view it sufficiently to determine it. Less than 1' in diameter."  On 20 Nov 1829 (sweep 228), JH logged "a star 11m with a luminous atmosphere 30" to 40" diameter."  On 29 Oct 1831 he noted "a * 10m with strong nebulous atmosphere 15" diameter.  Exactly round and pretty suddently fading away makes a double star class 5 with a star preceding."


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) described, "Central star about mag 10.  The nebula resembles a truncated ring from the ends of which extend much fainter wisps.  The brighter central portion is 38"x35" in PA 14°, while the total length along this axis is about 60"."

John Herschel discovered NGC 45 = h 2313 on 11 Nov 1835 and logged "extremely faint; large; round; very gradually very little brighter in the middle; attached to and nearly involving a large star; the following of two. A very faint object of singular appearance, 3 or 4' diameter; forms a kind of cometic appendage to the star, which, however, is quite at the edge."  His position is 9 sec of RA west of ESO 473-001 (error corrected by Herbert Howe in 1900).

Edward Cooper discovered NGC 46 = Au 2 on 22 Oct 1852 with the 13.3-inch refractor at the Markree Observatory in Ireland.  While compiling the comprehensive Markree Ecliptic Catalogue it was noted (probably by assistant Andrew Graham) as a nebulous star  but there is only a single mag 12.2 star at his position.  Auwers reported only finding a sharp, nebulous star on 28 and 30 Sep 1861, but included it in his 1862 list of new nebulae. Bigourdan also reported he could not find a nebula at the Markree position.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 47 in 1886 with the 11-inch refractor at the Arcetri Observatory.  There is no published record on his observation, so the discovery must have been communicated directly to Dreyer, but Tempel's position matches PGC 967.  Lewis Swift likely discovered this galaxy again on 21 Oct 1886, though his position for Sw. V-3 (later NGC 58) is 1 min of RA east of PGC 967.  The discovery priority is unknown.

Gaspare Ferrari discovered NGC 50 = Nova #13 = Sw. V-1 on 8 Jan 1866 while searching for Biela's Comet.  He was using the 9.5-inch Merz equatorial at the College Romain as an assistant to Father Angelo Secchi (see AN 1571).  His position matches MCG -01-01-058 = PGC 983.  Lewis Swift found this galaxy again on 21 Oct 1886 and reported it in his 5th discovery list. Swift's position was 12 seconds of RA too large and 25" too far south. Frank Muller noted the equivalence with GC 5092 (later NGC 50) in a Sidereal Messenger article (Feb 1887) listing nebulae from Swift's 5th catalogue that had been discovered previously (acknowledged by Swift in the errata to his 6th list).

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran): NGC 55 nearly filled the 37' field of the 21mm Ethos at 264x, extending close to 30' in length WNW-ESE and roughly 4' in width.  The structure was fascinating at 429x with a highly irregular surface brightness due to dusty patches and rifts, along with bright clumps and knots.  The "bright" central section, which is offset WNW of center, spans ~9' in length.  At the west end of the central section, the surface brightness dims significantly and the galaxy tapers, extending several arc minutes further WNW.  At the ESE side of the central portion is a bright, elongated, mottled core, roughly 1' in length and slightly bulging.  Just ESE of the core are two noticeable knots; the first is small but elongated, the second knot is very bright and elongated.  With careful viewing the second knot resolved into two individual pieces or clumps.  Continuing further ESE, the surface brightness drops significantly very quickly and a large, elongated dark notch appears to take a bite out of the galaxy.  Just as the galaxy begins to brighten again towards the ESE end, there is another bright round knot and a second very small piece just detached to the ENE.  At the ESE tip the galaxy brightens a bit more and has an irregular, patchy appearance with a couple of brighter stars superimposed.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): viewed at nearly 60° elevation at 212x, this huge galaxy was an amazing sight and overfilled the 23' field (at least 25' in length).  Near the core were two small, prominent HII knots. A couple of additional low surface brightness knots were visible further east along the mottled extensions.  The appearance was asymmetric with the brighter WNW section bulging slightly.


17.5" (11/1/86): very large, edge-on 6:1 WNW-ESE, 16'x3'.  Very asymmetric with a bright, elongated western portion, darker center and a faint eastern section (IC 1537).  Faint stars are involved at the west side.  The eastern portion appears tilted at a slight angle to the main western portion.


13.1" (11/5/83): fairly bright.  The very faint eastern portion is near detached from the bright WNW section.


8" (9/25/81): very large, very elongated, brighter to the west, very faint eastern section.


15x50 IS binoculars (10/21/06): although very low in the southern sky, visible as a faint, relatively large elongated patch using handheld IS binoculars.  Easy to locate 3.8° NW of Alpha Phe as the galaxy is exactly collinear with three mag 7 stars to the east that are aligned east to west.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 55 = D 507 = h2315 on 7 Jul 1826 from Parramatta, New South Wales.  Using his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector, he described it as "a beautiful long nebula, about 25' in length; position N.p. and S.f., a little brighter towards the middle, but extremely faint and diluted to the extremities. I see several minute points or stars in it, as it were through the nebula: the nebulous matter of the south extremity is extremely rare, and of a delicate bluish hue. This is a beautiful object." Dunlop observed the galaxy on 4 nights and made a simple sketch (Figure 21).


John Herschel first observed this galaxy from the Cape on 3 May 1834: "bright; very large; very much elongated in a long irregular train, the preceding end being much the brightest. Whole length = 1.5 diam. of field, or 22' The nucleus is either a double star or a much more sharply terminated nebulous mass, elongated in a different position (146.5 ) from that of the nebula (109.8 )." He observed it again on 23 October 1835, recording it as "very bright; very large; very much elongated; at least 25' long and 3' broad. The following part is faint, the preceding and shorter trinuclear the 2d, nucleus taken. A strange object." His final observation on 4 October 1836 reads: "very bright, very large; a very long irregular crooked ray with 3 nuclei, the second of which appears to consist of stars." His sketch of the galaxy (fig. 8, plate IV) clearly shows its convoluted form and three brighter sections. In his discussion, he grouped it together with the galaxy NGC 300 and the star cluster NGC 1950 as "nebulae of irregular forms having a tendency to several centres of condensation; in the case of [NGC 1950] but little conspicuous - in that of [NGC 55] (otherwise remarkable for its extravagant length and crooked shape) much more so, while in [NGC 300], the formation of separate nuclei is decided, the intermediate faint nebula barely sufficing to mark them as forming a connected system."


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 55 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope on 29 Oct 1875 (plate I, figure 2 in "Observations of the Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope from 1869 to 1885").  He reported "The present appearance agrees well with H.'s description and drawing. The 'following' portion is now much fainter than shown by H.'s sketch; indeed it is so very faint that its exact outlines cannot with certainty be determined, a faint whitishness being all that can be made out, while the star-like appearance described by H. in his portion cannot now be seen. The 'preceding' portion is still, as shown by H., much the brightest. There are still three nuclei, the centre one of which is much the brightest. H. says this one appears to consist of stars; but although I have tried several powers, I cannot with any certainty, determine this point, although it has, at times, a sparkling appearance. The 'following' portion of this nebula appears to have become much fainter since H. observed it."  Turner's sketch shows the bright knot on the eastern end of the galaxy.


Sw. XI-2 (later IC 1537), found by Swift on 23 Sep 1897 and described as "eeeF; vL; eE; close f NGC 55; f of 2." is actually the ESE arm of NGC 55, which was sketched by both Dunlop and John Herschel (plate IV, #8).

In the GC, JH notes that Auwers misidentified H II-243, which is identical to H II-241 (the confusion was caused by an omitted offset star).

Lewis Swift found NGC 58 = Sw. V-3 on 21 Oct 1886, in a trio with NGC 50 and NGC 54, with a 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  There is nothing at Swift's position but his description reads "vF, pS, R, wide D * near sp; 3rd of 3." Herbert Howe, using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory, was unable to find NGC 58 on two nights and suggested that NGC 58 was a duplicate of NGC 47, discovered earlier by Wilhelm Tempel in 1886.  This requires that Swift's RA for NGC 58 was 1.1 minutes too large.  Despite Swift's comment "3rd of 3", his description of a "wide D[ouble] star nr sp" applies to NGC 47, making this equivalence very likely.  Dreyer repeats Howe's efforts in the IC II Notes and adds "probably = [NGC] 47".  See Corwin's notes for the full story.

Frank Muller discovered NGC 66 = LM 2-279, along with NGC 65, in 1886.  His position is 1 min of RA west and 1' south of ESO 473-010 = PGC 1236.  His description of a mag 9 star 1.2' NNE matches this galaxy.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes).  The MCG entry for this galaxy (-04-02-002) gives the NGC designation was  "uncertain".

24" (9/15/12): very faint, very small, round, 12"-15" diameter, just visible continuously. This galaxy is at the west end of the NGC 68 group and on a line extending northeast with PGC 1185, NGC 68 and NGC 70 with each galaxy separated from the next by less than 1'.  PGC 1185, misidentified in most catalogues as NGC 67 and the faintest galaxy in the central region, is situated just 44" NE.  PGC 1185 appeared extremely faint and small, 8" diameter.


18" (11/14/09): this galaxy and PGC 1185 were the faintest members viewed in the NGC 68 group.  NGC 67 appeared as a mag 16 threshold glow 1.7' SW of NGC 68.  It required averted to occasionally glimpse, though a few times I could tell it was elongated.  In a 22" scope, I was able to hold this galaxy continuously at over 400x.


PGC 1185 was occasionally glimpsed as a threshold "star" sandwiched between this galaxy and NGC 68 (0.8' from both galaxies).  Most sources identify PGC 1185 as NGC 67 and this galaxy as NGC 67A or anonymous although it was clearly shown on Rosse's sketch of the field.  The identification is corrected on the NGC/IC Project site.


17.5" (8/27/87): extremely faint and small.  First in the NGC 68 group of 9 with NGC 68 0.9' NE, NGC 69 1.8' SE and NGC 71 1.9' E.  This observation may apply to NGC 67 or PGC 1185 very close NE.


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 67 using LdR's 72" on 7 Oct 1855, while observing and sketching the NGC 68 group (plate XXV, fig 1 in the 1861 publication).  PGC 1185 (close northeast) is misidentified as NGC 67 in various sources including Megastar.  See Corwin's notes.

A spiral arm is visible on the northwest side, curling clockwise to the south but the long, thin tidally stretched extensions to the northwest and southeast were not seen.  Forms a striking (interacting) pair with NGC 93 2.8' ENE.  A mag 12 star is 1.3' SW.  Although this galaxy is often identified as NGC 91, that number applies to a mag 14.8 star 1.9' S.


NGC 90 = Arp 65 was classified as a Spiral galaxy with small, high surface-brightness companions on arms.  LEDA 1669552, the "companion" just beyond the northwest tidal extension (2.4' NW of NGC 90), appeared faint (V ~17.1), small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 10"x6".  A mag 15.7 star is 30" SE. No redshift is available on this object, so it may lie far in the background.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 90 using Lord Rosse's 72" on 26 Oct 1854. The description mentioned "Several S; F neb visible at once in finder" so JH assumed at least 3 objects were discovered, which he catalogued as GC 40, 41, 42.  But a sketch of the NGC 90 field shows only two nebulae labeled as Alpha (now NGC 90) and Beta (now NGC 93).  Herman Schultz observed the field on 17 Oct 1866 with the 9.6" refractor at Uppsala and measured an object he thought was GC 40, but was actually Mitchell's Alpha.  His micrometric position matches UGC 208 = PGC 1405.  Because of an uncertainty in the position and identification, Dreyer catalogued this object as GCS 5096 with the comment "Query = GC 40, 41, 42?". Dreyer equated GC 40 = 5096 in the NGC.


Modern catalogues misidentify UGC 208 as NGC 91 but Schultz's position for NGC 91 falls precisely on a very faint star 1.9' S.  This misidentification may have originated in Curtis' description of nebulae (1918) based on Crossley photographs at Lick observatory.  See Corwin's notes for further discussion.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): at 303x; the core was distinctly orange-yellow.  In addition, I immediately noted a couple of obvious orange supergiants at the south edge of the core and in the outer halo on the east side.


30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 163x and 264x): absolutely stunning view in the 30" at 163x and 264x.  Even in the 37' field of the 21mm Ethos, the stars appeared to fill the entire field, only thinning out near the edge.  The pinpoint stars were amazingly packed, but increased in intensity to a relatively small, blazing core, which was plastered with resolved stars.  The very center of the nucleus contained a small, intense knot overlaid with packed stars giving a strong impression of layers.  I immediately noticed the core had a pale yellowish tint.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at low power (76x using a 27mm Panoptic) the blazing core had an unusual, pale yellow hue.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was the best view I had of 47 Tucanae during the week.  At 212x, the entire 23' field was packed edge-to-edge with pinpoint stars and the blazing, intense core, which had a yellowish tint, was resolved into a mesmerizing dense mat of stars.  The halo extended to at least 30'.


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this breathtaking globular was viewed at over 50° elevation and was stunningly resolved into several thousand stars out to a diameter of over 25'.  The star density steadily increases towards the center.  The relatively small 4' core was blazing and highly resolved right to the edge of a very small compressed nucleus.  A 3-dimensional affect was very strong with layers of stars forming a dense mat over the core.  Many of the stars in the halo are connected in chains and lanes.  The 9 mm Nagler did a better job of busting apart the stars in the core, although the cluster overfilled the field at this power. Although the total visual magnitude is just slightly fainter than Omega Centauri and the size slightly smaller, 47 Tucanae is certainly equal if not surpassing Omega Centauri in visual impact due to its dazzling central blaze.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): While at Bargo, I observed 47 Tucanae for the first time. Though still very low in the sky the view was thrilling.  At 186x, the globular filled the 26' field with an uncountable number of stars. Strongly concentrated to an intense, blazing core which was only partially resolved at a low elevation.  The highly resolved outer halo extended ~25' in an irregular outline while the central halo was very symmetric.  This is the most prominent naked-eye GC as so much of its light is concentrated into the central core and it lies in a sparse field with no other rivals other than the SMC.


Naked-eye: easy 4th magnitude naked-eye blur just west of the SMC, seen many times from the southern hemisphere.  Visible in a dark sky while very low in the sky and from suburban locations when higher in the sky.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered the nebulous appearance of NGC 104 = Lac I-1 = D 18 = 47 Tucanae = h2322 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  It appeared "like the nucleus of a fairly bright comet."  He placed it in group I, consisting of nebulae without stars.  The cluster was noted, though, as a "star" in Bayer's Uranometria, which was first published in 1603. The designation "47 Tuc" comes from Bode's extension of Flamsteed numbers to the southern constellations (these are not used today except for 47 Tuc and 30 Dor). With his 9-inch speculum reflector, James Dunlop logged "(47 Toucan, Bode) this is a beautiful large round nebula, about 8' diameter, very gradually condensed to the centre. This beautiful globe of light is easily resolved into stars of a dusky colour.  The compression to the centre is very great, and the stars are considerably scattered south preceding and north following."  His sketch in figure 1 of his catalogue shows a beautifully resolved, elongated cluster.


John Herschel observed it for the first time on 11 Apr 1834 and logged "the great cluster preceding the Nubecula Minor. Estimated dia of the denser portion 5'; of the whole (not, however, including loose stragglers) 8'. Stars 14..16 mag. and one of 12th mag N.p. the centre. Excessively compressed. (N.B. In a sweep below the pole, when of course owing to the low altitude much of the light was lost.)"  His observation of 12 Aug 1834 reads: "A most glorious cluster. The stars are equal, 14th mag., immensely numerous and compressed. Its last outliers extend to a distance of 2 min, 16 sec in RA from the centre. It is compressed to a blaze of light at the centre, the diameter of the more compressed part being 30 arcsec in RA. It is at first very gradual, then pretty suddenly very much brighter in the middle. It is completely insulated. After it has passed, the ground of the sky is perfectly black throughout the whole breadth of the sweep. There is a double star 11th mag. preceding the centre (Pos. 226.5 - 6.5 arcsec in RA from centre of neb.)" On 21 Sep 1835 he wrote: "Fills the field with its stragglers, condensation in three distinct stages, first very gradually, next pretty suddenly, and finally very suddenly very much brighter in the middle up to a central blaze whose diameter in RA is 13.5 sec and whose colour is ruddy or orange-yellow, which contrasts evidently with the white light of the rest. The stars are all nearly equal (12..14 mag). A stupendous object."  His final record of the object was on 5 Nov 1836: "A most magnificent globular cluster. It fills the field with its outskirts, but within its more compressed part, I can insulate a tolerably defined circular space of 90" dia wherein the compression is much more decided and the stars seem to run together; and this part I think has a pale pinkish or rose-colour."  In his diary Herschel also refers to the "Rose coloured central mass".

James Dunlop discovered NGC 134 = D 599 = D 590 with his 9" reflector on 7 Jul 1826.  His description for D 599 reads "very faint nebula, about 25" diameter, rather elliptical.  North of Eta Caelae Sculptoris.  There are four small stars south of the nebula in the form of a lozenge."  His position is 22' NNW of the galaxy but the description of the four nearby stars to the south clinches the identification.  For D 590 he simply logged "a faint round nebula, about 2' diameter."


John Herschel's position is accurate and he noted that his h2327 could be identical D 590.  He recorded it on 25 Sep 1834 as "vB; vL; vmE; pslbM; 8' long; 1' broad; pos = 47.9°; dies away gradually at both extremities; has a star 10th mag., distance 45", pos = 327.9.  On a second sweep on 19 Oct 1835 he logged "bright; large; vmE; pretty suddenly little brighter middle; 4' long; 1' broad; position = 227°; the following of 2."  He also sketched the galaxy (Plate VI, figure 19), clearly showing its spindle-shape with tapering edges.


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 134 on 2 Nov 1875 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope and noted, "The present appearance of nebula is exactly as represented in Herschel's sketch; the centre is sharp and stellar-like with power of 255; but with 420 it is more diffused, and somewhat sparkling. A careful examination leaves the impression that it is practically unchanged since Herschel's time, the only difference between his sketch and present aspect being the position of the North star, which in Herschel's sketch is shown in a straight line with the centre of nebula and s.f. star, whilst at present it is somewhat to the n.f. of that point; this may however be the fault of the engraver."

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 135 = LM 1-5 on 2 Oct 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position is 2 min of RA west (typical error) of LEDA 138192 but his sketch (examined by Harold Corwin) clearly identifies NGC 135 with this galaxy.  Javelle rediscovered the galaxy on 4 Nov 1891, reported it as new, and Dreyer catalogued J. 1-19 as IC 26.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position for NGC 135 around 1899 (repeated in the IC 2 notes) though Dreyer failed to equate NGC 135 and IC 26.  See Corwin's notes.


RNGC and PGC (and second sources such as Megastar) misidentify NGC 135 as IC 27 based on their positions.  The correct identification is given in NED, HyperLeda and SIMBAD.

48" (10/29/19): very bright striking spiral with an inner ring and a long, drawn out spiral arm!  Overall, at 610x the galaxy extended over 2:1 WSW-ESE, ~3.2' x 1.4'.  Very strongly concentrated with a very bright core that gradually increased to the center.  Immediately west of the core was a noticeably darker gap and a lower contrast gap was east of the core.  These gaps were outlined by bright arcs, each about 90°, creating a partial oval ring surrounding the core.


The western half of the halo had a low surface brightness and extended at least 1.5' from the center.  I noticed a brightening at the extreme west end of the halo.  Checking the SDSS, this is a split spiral arm, separated beyond a darker dust lane.  A thin, long spiral arm was attached at the south side of the core (along the inner ring) and was easily seen gently curving northeast, extending directly to a mag 12.6 star!


A small, faint knot, at most 10" diameter, was easily seen near the end of this arm, very close SSW [16"] of the mag 12.6 star.  This "knot" is a companion galaxy (2MASX J00340814-0941481), though its redshift is 1/3 greater than NGC 151, so it may be in the background.


24" (12/1/16): bright, fairly large, contains a very bright boxy rectangular central section that is slightly elongated NNW-SSE (this is the central bar and nucleus), encased by a fairly low surface brightness halo extended at least 2:1 E-W, ~2.7'x1.2'.  A mag 12.5 star is at or just off the ENE edge (1.7' from center). A superimposed companion is at the tip of the eastern spiral arm of the galaxy, very close southwest of the mag 12.5 star.  It was marginally glimpsed but only occasionally popped.


17.5" (9/17/88): moderately bright, moderately large, oval 5:3 WSW-ENE, 2.5'x1.5', bright nucleus.  A mag 13 star is at the ENE edge, 1.7' from the center.


13.1" (8/24/84): fairly bright, bright core, very bright nucleus, very faint halo elongated ~E-W.  A faint star is at the ENE edge.


William Herschel discovered NGC 151 = H II-478 = h30 = h2330 on 28 Nov 1785 (sweep 479) and logged "pB, L, lE, lbM."  John Herschel observed this galaxy at Slough and at the Cape, where he recorded "pF; R; gbM; 60"."  JH's two entries were combined in GC 74 and his position matches MCG -02-02-054 = PGC 2035.  Lewis Swift (IV-1) found the galaxy again on 9 Aug 1886, but his RA was 17 seconds of RA too large.  He assumed it was new and catalogued it again in his 4th catalogue (Sw. IV-1, later NGC 153).  So NGC 151 = NGC 153 with NGC 151 the primary designation.


Based on photos taken at the Helwan Observatory in 1919-20 with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector, NGC 151 was described as "4' x 1.5', bright almost stellar nucleus; spiral with at least 3 long, much curved arms in what are almost stellar condensations.  One o the arms appears to wind completely around the nucleus, and possibly extend to more than 3' from it to a star in p.a. 190°."

Overall, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, ~3'x2'.  At the center was a very small, intense nucleus.  A beefy spiral arm was attached at the west side of the nucleus.  It showed a high contrast, due to inner and outer dust lanes with a brighter, curving arc at its southwest end.  This arm rotated clockwise towards the southeast side, and hooked towards the northeast.  The second thick arm as attached on the east end of the nucleus.   It also showed a high contrast arc along its northeast portion, then rotated sharply clockwise towards the west and angled southwest to the west of the central region.  Two mag 13.6/15.3 stars (0.6' apart) lie 1.3' NE of center.  A dusty triangular wedge (between spiral arms) extended from these stars towards the core.

NGC 162

Lawrence Parsons discovered NGC 162 on 16 Oct 1866 using Lord Rosse's 72" and by Herman Schultz on 5 Sep 1867 with the 9.6" refractor at Uppsala Observatory. Both observers recorded a single star 75" NE of NGC 160.  This star was possibly noted even earlier by Heinrich d'Arrest on 22 Aug 1862.  Schultz assumed this object was GC 82, discovered by R.J. Mitchell at Birr Castle on 18 Sep 1857.  But Mitchell's object is a close companion of NGC 169 (now known as IC 1559), not NGC 162 as JH assumed.  Dreyer also observed this star on 6 Nov 1874 and noted "An eS, F neb point, or probably a F* nf h79 in PA 78"."


In the GC Supplement, Dreyer incorrectly decided "Rosse nova does not exist [so GC 82 = IC 1559 did not receive an NGC number].  82 was undoubtedly observed instead of 79, which latter nebula is not double.  The description in PT 1861, agrees perfectly with the appearance of 82"  He added that "Schultz's GC 80 has not been seen in Birr before 1874: I have therefore entered it in the catalogue as a nova."  So, Dreyer assigned Schultz's GC 80 to the single star (the one first seen by Lawrence Parsons in 1866) following NGC 160 and renumbered it as GC 5107.  RNGC misidentifies NGC 162 with an anonymous galaxy close SE of NGC 160 and Dorothy Carlson incorrectly equates NGC 160 = NGC 162 in her NGC errata list.  Wolfgang Steinicke thoroughly covered the identifications of GC 80 and 82 in his book on the history of the NGC.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 163 on 20 Sep 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His mean position (also measured on the next night) matches MCG -02-02-066 = PGC 2149.  Although William Herschel's H. III-954 is equated with NGC 163, his observation more likely applies to NGC 165 (see that number).  d'Arrest noted the 32 second discrepancy between his RA for NGC 163 and that of H. III-953, but surprisingly d'Arrest didn't record NGC 165, so didn't make the connection between H. III-953 and NGC 165.


Lewis Swift independently found NGC 163 on 9 Aug 1886 and recorded it in his 4th discovery list (#3).  Swift's RA was 14 seconds too large and falls between NGC 163 and 165. Harold Corwin notes that Swift's positions for three other galaxies he observed on this night (NGC 153, 217 and 7774) are all 10 - 15 seconds of time too large.  Based on a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector between 1912-13, Heber Curtis described NGC 163 as "Almost stellar; structureless; bright nucleus. A very faint spindle is 1.5' s.p.

In the 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH", Dreyer noted the RA of H. III-954 was 28 sec too large (for NGC 163).  Wolfgang Steinicke and Harold Corwin agree with the conclusion that H.

Wilhelm Tempel independently found NGC 165 in 1882 with an 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and reported it in his fifth discovery paper.  In his note on NGC 163, he mentions he found another fainter nebula 30 sec following.  Tempel's second nebula was assumed to be new, so he was credited with the discovery of NGC 165 in the NGC.  Spitaler measured an accurate position in 1891 at Vienna.  Based on a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector between 1912-13, Heber Curtis described NGC 165 as "Nearly round, 1' in diameter.

R.J. Mitchell, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 169 on 18 Sep 1857 with Lord Rosse's 72" and noted "a vS, double nebula, the n one is E sp nf, bM.  A month later he logged "D nebula, alpha [on a diagram] is mE p f, bM.  Beta is lE nearly n s, bM."  In Lord Rosse's 1861 publication, it was mistakenly assumed the the observation referred to NGC 160 so was not a new object.  The following year Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered NGC 169 and he was credited with discovery in the General Catalogue (GC 82), published in 1864.  Mitchell's "Beta" was assigned GC 80.


d'Arrest listed his discovery in a large table of new nebulae published in 1865, he was able to add a footnote that his object was discovered earlier at Birr Castle (assuming it was identical to GC 80).  In the NGC, Dreyer correctly credited both LrR and d'Arrest for the discovery of NGC 169, but he mistakenly described NGC 160 as a double nebula (repeating Mitchell's error) and deleted GC 80 (Mitchell's "Beta").  Finally, the companion was catalogued IC 1559, though it should have received a NGC designation.  See that number for more.

R.J. Mitchell probably discovered NGC 178 = LM 1-7 on 7 Dec 1857 as the observer on Lord Rosse's 72".  He stated "about one field of finder [26'] south, and a few seconds preceding, is another neb., faint, E nearly n s, no nucleus."  Dreyer assumed this description applied to GC 108 = NGC 207, but the north-south elongation clearly applies to NGC 178, which is 18' S, though 1.4 minutes of RA to the west.  Yann Pothier caught this correction in March 2020.


Ormond Stone made an independent discovery on 3 Nov 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "F, S, mE 0°, bM, faint wing south-preceding."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is 1.5 min of RA too far west but his description and sketch (examined by Harold Corwin) matches this galaxy. Stone was credited with the discovery in the NGC.  Finally, Stephane Javelle discovered NGC 178 again on 26 Aug 1892, assumed it was new based on position and listed it as the 28th object in his first discovery paper (J. 1-28, later IC 39).  Herbert Howe later searched for NGC 178 and measured an accurate position in 1898-99 (repeated in the IC 2 notes), though Dreyer failed to equate NGC 178 and IC 39.  See Corwin's notes.


The galaxy was described as "sausage shaped with a tail south", in the 1924 list of "nebula" descriptions at Helwan observatory.

24" (9/14/12): Hodge V is the brightest globular cluster in NGC 185, first identified by Paul Hodge in his 1974 paper "Photometry of the Globular Clusters of NGC 185" (PASP, 86, 289).  At 325x and 450x it appeared as an extremely faint star (V = 16.7), forming the southern vertex of a small equilateral triangle with a mag 14.5 star 20" N and a mag 15 star 20" NW.  This extragalactic globular was repeatedly glimpsed for brief moments and a couple of times it could be held for a few seconds.  Situated 3.8' NE of the center of NGC 185 and outside the visible halo of the galaxy.

This is a satellite system of M31 and a Local Group member at a distance of 2.15 million light years.

William Herschel discovered NGC 185 = H II-707 = h35 on 30 Nov 1787 (sweep 786) and recorded "pB, vL, irr R, vgmbM, resolvable, 5 or 6' diameter."  The first observation with LdR's 72" on 28 Mar 1848 reads "Resolved by a power of 800, although the night was rather hazy." This is a good example of how preconceptions that nearly all nebulae were resolvable influenced the results.  The NGC position is accurate.


James Keeler first photographed the galaxy using the Crossley reflector at Lick before 1900.  It was described (1918 Curtis publication) as "rather irregular slightly oval, 3' long; there are two curious rifts near the nucleus; it appears to be an irregular spiral.  The nebular matter is faint and diffuse.  A star of mag 14 is north of the very faint nucleus."


In 1944 William Baade announced that NGC 185, along with NGC 147, were members of the Local Group (1944ApJ...100..147B) when they were resolved into stars on plates take with the 100-inch at Mt Wilson. In an unusual situation, Baade requested that an actual photographic print of NGC 185 was bound in his ApJ paper to demonstrate resolution, as detail was lost with an ordinary halftone illustration.

With careful viewing, the system just resolves into two very small round knots, just 20" between centers.  The northern component is ~20" diameter and the southern member ~15". The two knots both have faint stellar nuclei and appear virtually tangent.  A third member, HCG 5C, is occasionally visible as an extremely faint knot off the NW side.


17.5" (12/11/99): Initially seen as a single faint, elongated glow at 220x.  At 280x in moments of good seeing this object cleanly resolved into two very close, very small knots with the brighter component on the north side.  HCG 5C was only intermittently visible with averted vision as a 15" threshold knot.


17.5" (9/5/99): NGC 190 is a challenging double system best viewed at high power.  Using 280x, at first appeared as an elongated irregular glow but with extended viewing, two "knots" oriented N-S were resolved within a common halo.  The brighter and larger component (HCG 5A) is at the north end and appears very faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  The southern component (HCG 5B) is extremely faint and small, perhaps 15" diameter.  HCG 5C is a threshold knot 1' NW.  The HCG is a subgroup of AGC 76 whose core is ~20' SSE and includes IC 1565, 1566 and 1568.


17.5" (10/8/88): very close double system, faint, small, elongated SSW-NNE, irregular.  HCG 5B is a very small companion attached at the south edge just 22" between centers.  In a compact group of four (HCG 5).


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 190 = Sw. V-8 on 22 Oct 1886 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  His position is just 6 sec of RA east of UGC 397.  His description mentions "3 or 4 stars near sp".  There are two mag 13 and 14.7 stars about 2' SW, but perhaps he also noticed the companion at the south edge (HCG 5B) and took it to be stellar.  Herbert Howe, observing with the 20" refractor in Denver, noted a mag 12.5 star lies about 30" due south of the nebula.  But this probably refers to HCG 5B.  MCG identifies M+01-02-042 as NGC 190 instead of both -041 and -042.

Caroline Herschel discovered M110 = M110 = H V-18 = h44 on 27 Aug 1783.  In the 1785 Philosophical Transactions, William wrote "there is a very considerable, broad, pretty faint, small nebula near it; my sister discovered it, August 27th, 1783, with a Newtonian two-feet sweeper."  Charles Messier probably made an earlier observation on 10 Aug 1773, though no report was published, nor does it appear in his notes.  A sketch published in 1807, though, showed both companions to M31. Kenneth Glynn Jones suggested adding NGC 205 as M110 in a 1967 Sky & Telescope article. William Herschel first observed it on 5 Oct 1784 (sweep 282).  On 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 613), he recorded "vB, mE, above 20' long nearly in the meridian; a few degrees from np to sf, the branches lose themselves."  On 24 Oct 1786 (sweep 621), he also logged "eB, mE.  I suppose not less than 1/2° long and 10 or 12' broad.; vgmbM; so as to come to a luminous nucleus.  The time very inaccurate, the telescope being off the roller, and only guided by hand."


M110 was observed with Lord Rosse's 72" on 2 Nov 1850 and "spirality" was suspected (falsely).  A later observation on 16 Oct 1855 recorded "vL; mE np by sf; sharp nucleus, for some distance round which, the neb. is bright and then suddenly decreases; there is a bright star np the nucleus; and another involved in sf end; another in preceding border.”

Size 4.2'x2';  PA = 0°


24" (8/25/19): quite prominent, very large elongated patch, extending 4'x2' N-S.  A number of faint stars were easily seen superimposed.  A brighter, narrow "spine" stands out well with the general star cloud.  NGC 206 can be traced further SSW, where it merges with Association 79, a very large 6'x2' cloud of lower surface brightness oriented SSW-NNE.  Association 80 is 3'  patch directly south of NGC 206 by 7' and has 3 brighter stars superimposed on the north side.  This patch also includes C107, a 5" open cluster on its south side.


48" (11/1/13): Using Jimi Lowrey’s 48-inch f/4, we carefully examined the large association NGC 206 for resolved stars using the finder chart in Stephen Odewahn's 1987 study "A photometric survey of the rich OB association NGC 206 in M31”.  I assumed using a labeled photographic chart it would not be difficult to identify individual stars, but his chart failed to capture the range in visual brightness of the Milky Way and cluster stars.  As a result I had to carefully verify small patterns of stars (triangle, quadrilaterals, etc.) several times to feel confident of the identifications.  After several minutes of observation, I had identified the 6 or 7 brightest members down to V = 17.6, as well as the superimposed Milky Way stars.  The brightest “star" (Odewahn #12 at V = 16.1) at the north edge was relatively prominent, but most were in the mag 17-17.5 range.


Finally, I stopped carefully scrutinizing individual stars, relaxed my eyes and just gazed at the entire star cloud with averted vision.  I was startled that in moments of good seeing, roughly 20 additional extremely faint stars popped in and out of view, mimicking the appearance of a dense open cluster or partially resolved globular cluster!  Based on photometry in the paper, the magnitudes of the resolved stars extended down to approximately V = 18.3-18.4. The cloud, itself, was quite irregular and split up into several slightly brighter patches.


Checking journal articles afterwards, I found that Odewahn #12 (= BH05) was not a single star but was listed as a globular cluster candidate (M31GC J004030+404530) in Barmby & Huchra’s 2001 paper "M31 Globular Clusters in the HST Archive: I. Cluster Detection and Completeness”.  But the 2010 paper "A Photometric catalog of 77 newly-recognized star clusters in M31” by Paul Hodge described the results of an HST WFPC2 search for star clusters in active star-formation regions of M31.  BH05 was reclassified as a luminous and massive young cluster with an unusually elliptical shape.  In addition, Odewahn’s #40 and #112 (and perhaps others) are also clumps of stars or clusters, but visually were essentially stellar.


17.5" (8/18/93): fairly faint, fairly large, elongated 5:2 N-S, 4.0'x1.6', low and uneven surface brightness.  A few very faint stars are just visible over surface including a brighter star at the south tip.  Located 40' SW of the core of M31.  This is the huge star cloud at the SW end of M31.


8" (12/6/80): very faint, moderately large, elongated N-S, low surface brightness patch near the SW end of M31.


William Herschel discovered NGC 206 = H V-36 = h45 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 613) and recorded "vF, vL, mE, about 20' long nearly in the meridian, or a little from np to sf."  John Herschel simply called it "a very large space filled with neb.”


E.E. Barnard independently discovered NGC 206 in 1883 and assumed it was new.

I have now confirmed the observation with the 6-inch Cooke Equatorial and as I can find no record of such nebula I suppose it is new."  Barnard quickly caught his mistake and credited Herschel the next month [AN 2691].  Interestingly, Barnard also reported discovery of the M31 association A54 on the opposite end of M31, though for some reason Dreyer didn’t assign this object a NGC designation.

J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 207 on 29 Oct 1877 as the observer on Lord Rosse's 72".  He wrote, "About 35 seconds preceding and 25' ± south [of NGC 210] is [NGC 178], very faint, S, lE p f, mbMN, stellar, 5' nnf a coarse double star 10-11 and 12m.  A very insignificant object."  The description applies, as well as the time difference (actual value 32 seconds preceding) in RA although the galaxy is 5' NNW of the coarse double star instead of NNE as stated.


Dreyer assumed R.J. Mitchell's description from 7 Dec 1857 referred to NGC 207, but as it mentions the object is elongated N-S, it more likely applies to NGC 178.  Ormond Stone independently discovered NGC 207 at Leader-McCormick Observatory on 3 Nov 1885 and reported it as new (LM 1-9) in the observatory's first discovery list.


IC 41 (discovered by Javelle) lies 3.7' north, although MCG, PGC and HyperLeda incorrectly equate IC 41 with NGC 207 (error also in Megastar).  RNGC misclassified NGC 207 as nonexistent and it was reported as not found at Helwan observatory in 1924 (though.  MCG -03-02-035 was noted 4' S of IC 41).  See RNGC Corrections #5.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 211 = St VIIIa-2 on 18 Nov 1876 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  Corwin notes that Stephan misidentified his offset star (GSC 0014-1250 at 00 40 43.5 +03 28 05) and when his offsets are reapplied they point directly to NGC 203, which was found three years earlier by Ralph Copeland using Lord Rosse's 72" on 19 Dec 1873.  So, NGC 211 = NGC 203, with the original discovery going to Ralph Copeland.  Emmanuel Esmiol did not catch Stephan's error when his rereduced Stephan's positions at the Observatoire de Marseille, so the position is incorrect in his 1916 paper.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 218 = St VIIIa-3 on 17 Oct 1876 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  His published position implies an offset of just 40" S of mag 8.9 SAO 54096 (given as the offset star) but there is nothing at this position and his description makes no mention of a nearby bright star.  The only nearby candidate is UGC 440, which is located 45 tsec W and almost 2' N of Stephan's offsets, and this galaxy is taken as NGC 218 in all modern catalogues.


I checked Emmanuel Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions at Marseilles Observatory and found that NGC 218 was left off of the main tables, but replaced with an "Anonymous" galaxy using a different delta RA but the same offset star (SAO 54096) and the same delta Dec.  Esmiol's new position corresponds exactly with UGC 480, although apparently this correction to the position of NGC 218 has gone unnoticed until now.  At the bottom of the page is the note "wrongly identified as NGC 218".  So, NGC 218 = UGC 480.  Harold Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke agree with this analysis.  Wolfgang notes in his book on the history of the NGC, that Esmiol's catalogue gives 4 discoveries of Stephan that did not receive NGC designations, but he missed this connection with NGC 218.  This identification has now been incorporated into NED, although it is still incorrect in HyperLeda (as of 2013) as well as the NGC/IC Project, which has not been updated in a long time.

There was no resolution except for a single faint star near the center.  A mag 11 star lies 1' NE and just south of NGC 222.  NGC 220 is the first of three in a chain with NGC 222 1.5' NE and NGC 231 4.0' NE.  Also NGC 176 lies 24' NW.  NGC 220 is located at the west edge of a large SMC star cloud (Hodge Association 3).


John Herschel discovered NGC 220 = h2338, along with NGC 231, on 12 Aug 1834 in the SMC and recorded "F, vgbM, irregular figure."  On a second sweep he wrote "The first of an irregular string of nebulae and stars which descends at an angle of about 45 degrees from the centre to the edge of the field (i.e. in a north-following direction)."  Finally, on a third sweep he recorded "F, R; the field is full of the nebulous light of the Nubecula Minor."  Harold Corwin notes that NGC 222 = h2339 may be a 4th observations of this cluster (see notes).


James Dunlop probably made an earlier discovery of NGC 220 = D 2 on 1 Aug 1826 using his 9" reflector.  He described a "faint nebula, about 1 1/2' long, irregular figure, rather branched.  This is involved in the margin of the Nebula minor."  His position is 3.6' NW of NGC 220, though given his general poor positions this identification is not certain.  Herschel assigned D 2 to NGC 231 = h2340 instead.


Pietro Baracchi observed the cluster on 16 Dec 1887 (first of 14 objects) with the Melbourne telescope and called it "pB, irr, pS, lBM, amidst stars."

Guillaume Le Gentil discovered M32 = NGC 221 = h51 on 29 Oct 1749.  He reported "While observing the Andromeda Nebula with a fine 18-foot telescope ... I saw another small nebula, about one minute in diameter which appeared to throw out two small rays; one to the right and the other to the left."  Messier found it independently in 1757 while observing M31, unaware of Le Gentil's earlier observation.


In the Appendix to the 1912 'Scientific Papers of Sir William Herschel' this description is given of M32: "1813, December 26, 20 feet telescope, a vB R nebula, vgbM, up to a nucleus."  John Herschel recorded (1 Oct 1828), "eB; pL; sbM to a * 10m; 40"; a small star follows it 11.5 seconds."

John Herschel discovered NGC 222 = h2339 on 11 Apr 1834 and simply recorded "vF, R, outlying."  His position, though, is unusually poor - landing 3.7' S of NGC 220.  Since h2339 was only recorded on the single sweep 441, Harold Corwin suggests this number may be another observation of NGC 220, which was recorded on 3 later sweeps, but not the one on 11 Apr 1834!  As NGC 220 is much more prominent than the smaller cluster taken as NGC 222, it seems unreasonable that JH would have missed NGC 220.  On sweep 625, JH recorded NGC 220 as "The first of an irregular string of nebulae and stars which descends at an angle of about 45 degrees from the centre to the edge of the field (i.e. in a north-following direction)".  It's very possible that the cluster taken as NGC 222 was one of these "string of nebulae and stars" as it is just 1.5' NE of NGC 220, so perhaps he did see the cluster on this date.  See Corwin's notes for more on this identification.


James Dunlop's D 2, discovered on 1 Aug 1826, may refer to this chain.  He described a "faint nebula, about 1 1/2' long, irregular figure, rather branched.  This is involved in the margin of the Nebula minor."  His position is ~3.5' WNW of NGC 220/222 but given his general poor positions, this identification is not certain, and more likely would apply to NGC 220 (brightest cluster).  Herschel assigned D 2 to NGC 231 = h2340.

George Phillips Bond discovered NGC 223 = HN 7 = Au 4 = Sw. VI-5 on 5 Jan 1853.  It was found with the 15-inch Merz refractor during the Harvard Zone observations of stars near the celestial equator.  He noted a round nebula, between stars #131 and 132 and measured the dec, but not the RA.  The discovery was listed as #4 in Auwers 1862 list of new nebulae, though the RA was only given to the nearest minute of time.  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered the galaxy on 1 Jan 1862 and assumed it was a new discovery.  He added a note of Bond's earlier discovery in his 1865 catalogue of new nebulae.  Lewis Swift made another discovery (list VI, #5) on 21 Nov 1886.  Finally Swift "discovered" it again on 12 Nov 1890, and described Sw. X-1 (later IC 44) as "eF; S; R; bet 2 st." His position was ~2' too far north and Dreyer either assumed it was new or just missed the equivalence.  In any case, NGC 223 = IC 44.

Very large bright core containing a stellar nucleus using direct vision.  There are two black parallel dust lanes along the NW side of the core.  The galaxy extends beyond the star cloud NGC 206 located about 40' SW of the core.


18": a total of 38 globular clusters have been tracked down in M31 as well as 9 star clusters.


Persian astronomer Abd-al-Rahman Al-Sûfi first mentioned M31 = NGC 224 = h51 in his "Book of Fixed Stars" (964 AD) as the "Little Cloud" lying before the mouth of a Big Fish (an Arabic constellation).  Surprisingly, Tycho Brahe didn't mention M31 in his star catalogue (nor Hipparchus or Bayer), which included 6 nebulous objects (only real one was M44). German astronomer Simon Marius made the first telescopic observation of M31 (actually of any nebula) on 15 Dec 1612 and it appeared to be composed of rays of light, increasing in brightness towards the center, mared by a dull, pale light.  It appearance "resembling the light of a burning candle, atsome distance, shining through translucent horn."  Giovanni Hodierna listed it as a new nebula in his catalog based on his observation in 1654, so apparently he was unaware of Marius' observation in 1612.  Cassini, in 1740, represented its shape as nearly triangular.  Le Gentil considered it round for some years, then oval, but always of a uniform light.  In 1764 Messier wrote "it resembles two cones or pyramides of light, opposed at their bases, the axes of which are in direction NW-SE."  Due to these varying descriptions, it was thought the nebula might be variable.


William Herschel first observed M31 in 1780 ("has no star in it") but using a 6-inch on 2 Aug 1783 he noted, "227x, a strong suspicion of stars.  This speculum has not light enough.  I doubt not but 20 feet will confirm it.  460x, suspicion still stronger."  He was obviously mistaken on the resolvability.  WH also noted the nebula "begins to shew a faint red colour."  Perhaps he detected a slight hue to the nuclear region (red giants), though this seems unlikely.  In 1826 John Herschel wrote, "At present it has not, indeed, a star, or any well-defined disk in its center, but the brightness, which increases by a regular gradation from the circumference, suddenly acquires a great accession, so as to off the appearance of a nipple as it were in the midd, of very small diameter (10" or 12")...Its nebulosity is of the most perfectly milky absolutely irresolvable kind, with the slightest tendency to that separation into flocculi above described in the nebula in Orion..."


The quasi-stellar nucleus was observed by Johann Lamont on 13 Oct 1836 with a 10.5-inch refractor at Munich Observatory and measured as 6.9" diameter.  George Bond made a remarkable sketch in 1847 using the new 15-inch Harvard refractor, showing two sharply defined dust lanes, a stellar nucleus and M32 and M110 embedded within the halo of M31. He mentioned "a sudden interruption of light, appearing like a narrow, dark band, in which the eye could detect no deviation from perfect straightness, streating, in the direction of the axis of the nebula, entirely across the field of view; exterior to this, with respect to the axis, was another band or canal..."  Bond also traced the major axis to a length of 4°.  Leopold Trouvelot produced a beautiful sketch of the dust lanes in 1874 at the Harvard College Observatory.


The spiral nature, though, was first revealed in photographs by Isaac Roberts in 1888 with a 20-inch reflector (reproduced in many publications) and E.E. Barnard in 1890 with the 12-inch refractor, though neither used in the word "spiral" in their papers.  Roberts speculated wildly on the nature of M31, suggesting it was a "new solar system in the process of condensation from a nebula" and the two companions, M32 and M110, were "already undergoing their transformations into planets."


Ernst Hartwig discovered the first extragalactic supernova on 20 Aug 1885 near the center of M31.  SN 1885A = S And reached mag 5.85 and faded to mag 14 a half a year later.  The brightness (if a nova) seemed evidence that M31 was relatively nearby (within the Milky Way).  In 1899, though, German astronomer Julius Scheiner obtained a spectrum using a 7.5 hour exposure and found "No traces of bright nebular lines are present, so that the interstellar speace in the Andromeda nebula, just as in our stellar system, is not appreciably occupied by gaseous matter." He further stated "previous suspicion that the spiral nebulae are star clusters is now raised to a certainty, the thought suggests itself of comparing ..our stellar system, with especial reference to its great similarity to the Andromeda nebula."  This added strong support for the "island-universe" theory.  Hubble first identified a Cepheid variable (V1) in M31 on a plate taken October 5-6, 1923.  In 1944, while the Los Angeles area was in a World War II blackout, William Baade first resolved the central region of M31, M32, M110 as well as NGC 147 and NGC 185 using the 100-inch at Mount Wilson.

24" (1/4/14): bright, large, scattered group of ~50 stars in 10' group.  Includes 15-18 brighter stars that stand out (mag 9.5-11).  A ragged N-S string of stars defines the eastern border of the cluster.  There are no rich subgroups and a lack of faint stars.


A detached group of stars is off the north side, but these stars do not appear to be part of the cluster.  vdB 4, a very faint reflection nebula, is involved with these stars though it was not noticed.


17.5" (11/2/91): about two dozen stars at 100x in a 12' diameter.  Bright but scattered.  Outline forms an isosceles triangle with the vertex at west edge and the long base on the east side.  Most stars are mag 10-11 and evenly spaced.  The cluster appears completely resolved.  Only one fairly close double star in group.  Just ENE of the main group is a line of five mag 9 stars oriented N-S.


8": two dozen stars in a cluster, fairly bright but scattered, no dense spots.


Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 225 = H VIII-78 = h52 on 27 Sep 1783 (and seen again on 30 Oct 1783 and 23 Feb 1784) with her 4.2" comet seeker reflector.  The cluster was first seen by William on 11 Mar 1784 before he began the evening's sweeps. On 26 Nov 1788 (sweep 887), he recorded, "a good many coarsely scattered L stars of an equal size, they take up a space of 15 or 20'."

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this SMC cluster appeared as a moderately large, low surface brightness hazy region with an irregular outline, ~2' diameter.  A few mag 14 stars were resolved.  Last of three open clusters with compact NGC 222 2.5' SW and NGC 220 4.0' SW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 231 = h2340 on 12 Aug 1834 (sweep 482) and recorded "an irregular train of stars and nebulosity in the Nubecula Minor. (Evidently that referred to in sweep 625 [NGC 220])." His position falls very close to the cluster taken as NGC 231 (ESO 029-005 = Lindsay 25), but Corwin suggests NGC 231 really refers to the entire string of 3 clusters - NGC 220, 222 and 231.  I agree - this was his first observation here and he certainly wouldn't have picked up just the single faintest cluster but either noticed the entire string or just NGC 220 and 222, the two brightest clusters.


Herschel suggested h2340 might be equivalent to D 2, but Dunlop likely saw only NGC 220 or both NGC 220 and 221, which he described as "a faint nebula, about 1.5' long, irregular figure, rather branched. This is involved in the margin of the Nubecula Minor."

John Herschel discovered NGC 241 = h2342 on 12 Aug 1834 and described "a very F, R nebula or group (We are now fairly in the Nubecula Minor, and field begins to be full of faint perfectly irresolvable nebulous light."  There is nothing at his sinngle Cape of Good Hope position but 10' N is h2343 (later NGC 242).  Herschel caught this error and corrected the NPD in an errata list at the end of the CGH catalogue, though apparently he didn't notice the nearly identical positions.  Since Herschel only observed NGC 241 on a sweep where NGC 242 was not recorded, Harold Corwin (as well as ESO and Eric Lindsay) equate NGC 241= NGC 242.  Since NGC 242 refers to his first observation it should be the primary designation.  See Harold Corwin's notes for more.

John Herschel discovered NGC 242 = h2343 on 11 Apr 1834 and recorded "pL; vF; R; vgbM; (in a sweep below the pole and ill seen) the RA is probably also in error.  On a second sweep he recorded "a binuclear nebula, or two, vS, R, running together."  Finally on a third sweep he noted "a small irresolvable knot in the bright part of the Nubecula Minor."  NGC 241 = h2343, recorded in Aug 1834, is a duplicate observation (see notes).


Interestingly, Pietro Baracchi observed the cluster on 16 Dec 1887 (as well as numerous other SMC clusters) with the 48" Melbourne telescope and logged it as two objects (labeled as "D" and "E") "almost forming a double nebula".  The main NW clump was called "pB, very small, nebulous star" and the SE knot as "pB; eeS; nebulous star very close to D.  I believe two minute stars in D and one in E which makes the objects sparke, many stars in the field."  This matches Herschel's description of "a binuclear nebula, or two..."  SIMBAD labels the NW clump as NGC 241 = Kron 22w = Lindsay 29w and the SE clump as NGC 242 = Kron 22E = Lindsay 29e and NGC 241/242 is listed as a star cluster pair in 2000A&AS..146...57D.

00 47 03.3 -11 52 19; Cet

V = 10.4;  Size 240"x210";  PA = 120°


48" (10/23/14): At 488x with an NPB filter the view of the Skull Nebula was breathtaking and all the structure in a detailed photograph was visible.  The thin brighter rim varied in brightness, thickness and scalloped structure along its entire length.


The rim is brightest along a 60° arc on the western side, bulging inward just north of center, creating a small darker indentation in the rim due west of the prominent central star. Moving counterclockwise around the rim, a small brighter, elongated patch is at the northwest edge, close to a mag 11.5 star just outside the planetary.  The rim is relatively weak along the north side, but two brighter (detached) patches are along the northeast side.  An irregular, elongated luminous patch spreads inward here.  This glow is fairly prominent just northeast of center, on line with the central star and the second interior mag 12 star (southwest of center). A second luminous patch is midway from the central star to the north rim.  The rim is weakest overall along a 90° arc on the eastern side, near a mag 13.5 star, which is embedded just within the planetary. Two more luminous patches are visible at the south rim, with the westernmost glow both larger and brighter.


The interior is relatively dark, though glows weakly with subtle variations, creating pockets of darkness - one is northeast of the central star - and mild enhancements.  A small diaphanous glow is just south of the mag 12 star on the southwest side.  More extensive milky nebulosity extends inward from the southern rim, though the most prominent interior glow is the split nebulosity mentioned earlier on the northwest side.


33" (9/16/07): gorgeous annular planetary viewed at 200x.  The thin brighter rim was striking and varied in brightness and thickness around the periphery.  The rim is brightest along the western or WNW edge and weakest on the east side.  The interior was darker but irregular in surface brightness.


18" (10/13/07): 175x gave an excellent view using the NPB filter and the thin, bright irregular rim (only dimming on the east side) and darker center was quite striking.


18" (8/23/03): I took a quick look at 160x from Chew's Ridge with a thin waning crescent low in the ENE.  Without a filter I don't remember the brighter rim being so crisply defined and the annularity so clear.  The superimposed stars gave the planetary a transparent, 3-dimensional feel as if I was seeing inside the object.


17.5" (1/8/00): at 100x, appears as a moderately bright, 3.5' irregular glow with a darker center and encompassing four stars including the 12th magnitude central star.  Excellent contrast gain using an OIII filter, which sharpens up the edge of the roundish annulus and enhances the irregular surface brightness.  The halo is brightest along a 270° arc running from SW to NE and is clearly weakest at the east edge of the halo.  A mag 11.5 star is embedded at the NW edge of the halo 2.0' from center.  The irregular central hole is much darker but faintly luminous.  A mag 12 star is also superimposed southwest of the central star and a 4th star is just inside the eastern boundary.  The central star forms a thin right triangle with the other two brighter stars.  At 220x, the western 90° outer arc is brightest and there appears to be a knot embedded at the NE edge of the halo.


17.5" (9/19/87): fairly bright, large, 4' diameter, annular.  Four stars are involved including the central star.  This planetary has an irregular surface brightness with subtle structure.


13" (11/5/83): fairly bright with filter, clearly annular, sharper edges.  NGC 255 lies 15' SSE.


8" (11/5/83): fairly faint, large, four stars involved.  No annularity noted.


16x80 (8/24/84): faintly visible in finder.


80mm finder (10/13/07): visible unfiltered at 25x.  Nice contrast gain using the NPB filter and the planetary also appears to increase in size.


William Herschel discovered NGC 246 = H V-25 = h56 on 27 Nov 1785 (sweep 478) and recorded "four or five pL stars forming a trapezium of 4 or 5' diameter. The enclosed space is filled up with milky nebulosity faintly terminated. The stars seem to have no connection with the nebulosity."  The 1973 Revised New General Catalogue of Nonstellar Objects (RNGC) reversed the sign of the declination (+), and this typo was copied into some amateur software and digital setting circles.


Isaac Roberts described NGC 246 as a spiral nebula based on an early photograph.  In 1912 Knox-Shaw reported it was not a spiral, but "like the Owl nebula", based on a photograph taken at the Helwan Observatory with the Reynolds reflector from 1909-11.  Still Hardcastle later classified NGC 246 as a spiral nebula.  Campbell (at Lick) and Paddock found the spectrum to be of a PN.   Based on a Crossley photograph, Heber Curtis described (1918) "a somewhat irregular oval, brightest on western edge; 4'x3.5' in PA 120°.  Periphery clear-cut, with a broken ring effect.  Very faint, irregular matter in inner parts.  The central star is bluish, and considerably brighter photographically than visually."

V = 9.1;  Size 21.4'x6.9';  Surf Br = 14.4;  PA = 174°


48" (10/31/13): at 287x, NGC 247 spanned at least 18'x5' NNW-SSE and stretched from an HII region at the NNW tip to beyond a mag 9.5 star (HD 4529) near the SSE end.  A very large, elongated darker region (though not primarily caused by dust extinction), dubbed the "Needle's Eye", forms an interesting feature on the NNW side of the halo.  Visually it extended at least 3.5'x1.0'.  A relatively bright HII knot (identified in NED as MRSS 540-038059 from the "Muenster Red Sky Survey") is beyond this feature at the NNW end of the major axis, 9.5' from center.  This knot appeared fairly faint, relatively large for an HII region, elongated ~N-S, 20"x12".  A second well-defined HII knot is MRSS 540-038506, found 5' NNW of center.  This easy patch appeared fairly faint, elongated, 15"x10".  At least two small knots (including MRSS 540-038001) are on the SW side of the halo, ~2.4' from center and ~1.5' E of a mag 12-12.5 star just off the west edge of the disc.  Finally, I picked up a faint, very small knot, ~6" diameter, situated 3.5' SSE of center and 1.1' N of a mag 13.5 star.  This HII region (not in the MRSS) forms a "double" with a mag 15 star 15" N.


17.5" (11/1/86): bright, very large, bright core, elongated 7:2 N-S, 14'x4'.  The southern extension is brighter and mag 9 SAO 166572 is superimposed at the southern end about 6' from the core.  Burbidge's Chain (VV 518) lies 18' NNE.


13" (8/5/83): fairly bright, diffuse, very large, bright core.


8" (10/4/80): very large, elongated ~N-S, bright core.  A mag 10 star is at the south tip.  The southern extension appears brighter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 247 = H V-20 = h57 on 20 Oct 1784 (sweep 303) and logged "a Streak of light about 27' long, and in the brightest part, which was pB is 3' or 4' broad. The extension nearly in the meridian (I believe a little from from S.p. to N.f.) ... The situation is so low, that it would probably appear of much greater extent in a higher altitude."  John Herschel observed NGC 247 at Slough on 16 Sep 1830 (sweep 293) and noted "eF; vL; vmE; vglbM; 10' long; pos 172.0 deg. Has no bright star in it, but a star 8.9 mag at some distance n.p."  Surprisingly, he made no (published) observations at the Cape of Good Hope.


Based on a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector, Heber Curtis described NGC 247 as "a faint, very large spiral, 18'x5' in p.a. 175°.  Nucleus stellar; many almost stellar condensations.  Whorls somewhat irregular, and indistinct." (1918)

NGC 248 = SMC-N13A/B = ESO 029-8

00 45 24.0 -73 22 47; Tuc

Size 0.8'


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this fairly faint SMC nebulous cluster appeared as an irregular glow, 0.8'x0.6', elongated NW-SE.  There was a good response using a UHC filter at 76x.  One or two stars or knots are involved including a small nebulous knot at the southeast end.  NGC 256 lies 8' SSE and NGC 242 is 9' SW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 248 = h2344 on 11 Apr 1834 and logged "very faint.  Below the pole, and the sweep otherwise irregular."  On a later sweep he recorded "faint, elongated or binuclear, small, very gradually a little brighter in the middle."  His position matches the knot at the southeast end.


Pietro Barachhi observed this cluster on 16 Dec 1887 along with a number of other SMC clusters with the 48" Melbourne telescope.  He listed NGC 248 as two separate objects; the NW object (SMC-N13B) was labeled as "F" and called "pF; eeS a faint nebulous star" and the SE object was labeled as "G" (SMC-N13A) and described as "very close to F, almost forms a double nebula - this is a little brighter and larger than F.  pB; vS; R; pmbM."

NGC 249 = SMC-N12B = ESO 029-9

00 45 33 -73 04 48; Tuc

Size 2.0'


25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): NGC 249 is the first of four striking, collinear SMC nebulae and clusters with NGC 261 5' ESE, SMC-N19 10' ESE and SMC-N30 15' ESE.  At 244x it appeared fairly bright, large, roundish, ~1.5' diameter. A few individual stars were superimposed.  The view with a NPB was superb as the contrast was increased as well as the size to over 2'.  NGC 249 resides in a gorgeous region of the SMC with a bright background due to the star density.  This nebula contains one of only 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (SMC AB 10) in the SMC.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this SMC cluster with nebulosity appeared fairly bright, fairly large, slightly elongated, 1.3'x0.9', weakly concentrated. Two or three faint stars are involved including a mag 13 star just north of the center. The UHC filter produces a good contrast boost and increased the size to at least 2'.  Forms a pair with NGC 261 4.5' ESE with NGC 242 18' S.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 249 = D 19? = h2346 on 5 Sep 1826 with his homemade 9" speculum reflector and recorded "a small faint elliptical nebula - this is the preceding in a line of small faint nebulae."  His position is just 3.7' N of this SMC nebula, although his positions can be all over the map, so assigning a specific object is difficult as NGC 261 is close following.


JH recorded this nebula on 3 sweeps, first logging "faint, large, round; very gradually brighter in the middle; 2' across. Here begins a starry region of the Nubecula Minor." The second observation reads: "pretty bright, pretty large, oval, resolvable, 2' diameter." The last notes are "faint, round, 30 arcseconds." Herschel notes that this entry could refer to either Dunlop 19 or 21.

24" (11/21/19): at 322x; nearly moderately bright, moderately large, slightly elongated E-W, moderate concentration with a bright core and faint halo that extends over 1'.  The surface brightness seemed irregular like a face-on spiral (it is) and the periphery varied with averted vision.  A mag 12.5 star is 1' NE of center and a 3.5" pair of mag 14.5 stars is just off the E edge.  Located 10' E of mag 6.1 59 Psc.


UGC 477, located 25' WSW, is a challenging edge-on. At 200x and 322x it was very faint, moderately large, very low surface brightness streak ~N-S with only a slightly brighter core region, ~1.5'x0.3'.


17.5" (10/20/90): fairly faint, fairly small, oval 3:2 E-W, weak concentration.  Enclosed by a small group of four mag 12-14.5 stars including a mag 12.5 star (close double) just 0.7' E.  Located 9.5' E of 59 Piscium (V = 6.1).


William Herschel discovered NGC 251 = H III-204 = h58 on 15 Oct 1784 (sweep 291) and reported "vF, S, s.p. 2 vS stars, a third star in it but not in the center, and I suppose is not connected with it.  240 verified it."  On 13 Nov 1786 (sweep 635) he logged "vF, S, lbM, just preceding two stars are in the same meridian."  John Herschel recorded "vF; R; follows a *6.7 40s and is 1.5' north of it.  It is near 2 v s st.  If this be III 204, my father polar distance is 5' wrong."

NGC 253 = ESO 474-029 = MCG -04-03-009 = UGCA 13 = PGC 2789 = Sculptor Galaxy = Silver Coin Galaxy

00 47 33.1 -25 17 17; Scl

V = 7.2;  Size 27.5'x6.8';  Surf Br = 12.7;  PA = 52°


48" (10/23/14): although I've viewed NGC 253 several previous times with Lowrey's 48", I'm always amazed by the spectacular view as the mottled galaxy explodes into numerous bright knots, dusty patches, dark lanes and luminous star associations.  Using a 21mm Ethos (232x), NGC 253 completely filled the 26' field.  The central region of this starburst galaxy contains a blazing, nonstellar nucleus surrounding by an intense, elongated core with several bright patches around the periphery of the core (segments of the inner spiral arms).  Just northwest and southeast of the nucleus are extremely bright sections of the core.  Since the galaxy is only 12° from edge-on, many visible features extend parallel to the SW-NE major axis (PA = 52°).


A dark lane running SW-NE parallels the core just off its northern side.  Close northwest and parallel to this dust lane is a very bright, fairly narrow arm, extending ~3' in length.  Another thin arm (also running SW-NE) is to the southeast of the core with a prominent, very thin section ~3.5' SW of center, just southwest of a superimposed mag 12.5-13 star.  Three smaller bright patches surround a superimposed star ~2.5' NE of the nucleus.  The brightest and largest of these patches is close southeast of the star.  Further northeast the surface brightness lowers in the outer portion of the galaxy, but it still appears curdled and blotchy.  Several bright stars are near the periphery including a mag 9.3 star 6.2' SW of center and a mag 11.6 star 3.8' W of center.  A brighter patch is ~3.5' WSW of center is near the latter star.  Additional luminous patches are further out on the southwest end.


30" (10/12/15 - OzSky): superb view at 152x and 303x with NGC 253 within 10° of the zenith.  Much of the detail seen in Lowrey's 48" was visible, although the bright patches were not quite as contrasty.  The nucleus is a very small region embedded in a very bright, elongated central region that is enhanced immediately south of the nucleus.  A thin, luminous "arm" extends in the direction of the major axis near the north side.  A long spiral "arm" is along the northeast flank of the galaxy, extending 5 or 6' in length.  Three slightly brighter patches were noted to the northeast of the core close to a superimposed star (also marked in the 48" observation).  A bright, elongated strip was along the southwest side, about 2.8' NNW of a mag 9.3 star near the southwest edge (6.2' from center).


30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): stunning view in the 13mm Ethos at 264x although the galaxy overfilled the 23' field.  The dust structure and knots were mesmerizing but I didn't take detailed notes.


17.5" (8/29/92): at 100x; very bright, very large, edge-on 6:1 SW-NE, 30'x5', at 100x.  The galaxy exhibits only a weak central concentration to a small elongated core that is slightly larger than the visible knots.  Remarkable dust structure and mottling visible particularly on the southwest extension and a dark lane runs along the north side.  Three faint HII knots are visible near a superimposed star on the southwest side and a slightly brighter knot lies northeast of a star near the core.


13" (9/11/82): very bright, elongated 4:1 SW-NE, very mottled, dust lanes, dark patches, 30' diameter.


8" (9/11/82): very bright, very elongated, mottled, 25'-30' diameter.


10x30mm IS binoculars: easily visible as an elongated glow.


Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 253 = H V-1 = h61 = h2345 on 23 Sep 1783 (before William started his sweeps) with a "small Newtonian Sweeper of 27 inches focal length, and a power of 30."  This was the only galaxy she discovered.  William took a look in his 6.2" reflector and described it as a nebulous spot lengthened out to a considerable extend from SW to NE.".  He found it just a month later on 30 Oct 1783 while sweeping horizontally (solo sweep 8 of his second night and only internal discovery #3) with his 18/7-inch, though he knew it was previously found by his sister.  He noted, “On looking at the nebula a long while the suspicion of its consisting of stars grows stronger as it begins to put on a faintly mottled appearance.”  On 27 Oct 1785 (sweep 467) he recorded "about 45' long and 7 or 8' br; cB, mBM.  The place taken is that of the brightest part of it, where there is a small star visible, which however I suppose has no connection with the nebula.  It makes an angle of 25 or 40° with the meridian, from sp to nf.  The faint ends of it require much attention to be seen, and I believe extend much farther than I could trace them."


John Herschel recorded it from the Cape as "vvB; vvL; vmE; 30' long, 3' or 4' broad; has several stars in it; gmbM to a centre elongated like the nebula itself. The nebula is somewhat streaky and knotty in its constitution and may perhaps be resolvable." A second observation in 1836 was logged as "vvB; vvvL; a superb object; 24' in length, breadth about 3'; pos = 143.8 very exact. Its light is somewhat streaky, but I see no stars in it but 4 large and one very small one, and these seem not to belong to it, there being many near."  In the GC, he noted the position angle should read 54.5°.


William Lassell sketched NGC 253 from Malta in November 1863 with his 48" and included numerous dark lanes and rifts on the southwest side and a very irregular outline. Wilhelm Tempel's sketch with the 11" Amici refractor at Florence captures several small knots (brightest in the nucleus) and accurately depicts the surrounding star field and superimposed stars.  The origin of the "Silver Coin" nickname goes back to at least 1964 (Time-Life International edition of "The Universe"), with the description "Silvery Coin of the flat Sc spiral NGC 253", though the 1962 edition published in the U.S. reads "Silvery Dollar ..."

Stoney probably also discovered NGC 260 to the northeast (the 3rd nebulae), and it was also seen in 1854, though d'Arrest was credited with the discovery in the NGC.

William Herschel discovered NGC 259 = H II-621 = h63 = h64 on 13 Dec 1786 (sweep 646) and recorded "F, E from np to sf, 1 1/2' long, lbM."  He found it again the following year on 11 Sept 1787, relisting the nebula as II-703.  The second observation had an error in the offset position, so WH thought it was a new discovery.  Strangely, JH also recorded the galaxy twice, as h 63 (called a "Nova") and h 64 = H II-621.  Heinrich d'Arrest noted the equivalence of both entries. See JH's note in the GC and NGC.

George Johnstone Stoney discovered NGC 260 on 22 Dec 1848 with LdR's 72" and recorded "3 neb in a line nff, p one = h59 [NGC 252], other two vF [NGC 258 and NGC 260], middle one [NGC 258] eF, vS, distance of extremes about 12'."  Although NGC 260 = UGC 497 is 9' ESE of NGC 252, it is collinear with the other two, and most likely the 3rd nebula seen by Stoney.  Another observation in 1854 also mentions "3 neb".


Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered NGC 260 on 27 Aug 1865 with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen.  His position matches UGC 497.  He noted "one of Rosse's" although d'Arrest, instead of LdR, was credited with the discovery by Dreyer.

25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 244x; prominent, fairly large roundish glow, ~1.25' diameter, high surface brightness, surrounding a 13th magnitude H-alpha emission star (SK 9 = Lin 78).  Excellent contrast gain adding a NPB (narrow-bandpass) filter yielding a superb 2' nebula, sandwiched between similar NGC 249 5' WNW and the stellar association Hodge 12 with nebulosity (SMC-N19).  A number of stars are close east (part of the association) including three collinear mag 13.5-14 stars 2' E and a 4th mag 12.5 star 3' E.


SMC-N19 lies 5' ESE.  At 244x it was a fairly faint, very large nebulous glow, ~3' diameter.   With careful viewing an uncatalogued detached piece is sometimes visible to the NW (centered at 00 47.5 -73 05) and very faint nebulosity spreads to the southwest for a total diameter of 4' diameter.  Unfiltered a 6' cloud of at least 50 mag 12.5-15 stars (Hodge Association 12) are involved with the nebula.


SMC-N30 lies ~11' ESE.  At 244x unfiltered it was a fairly easy, fairly large, irregular curving or kidney-shaped nebula SW-NE, ~1.5'x0.8'. Unfiltered a couple of 14th magnitude stars are involved. Adding a NPB filter, the nebulosity was prominent and filled in to a more roundish outline.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this SMC HII region appeared fairly bright, moderately large, round, 1.5' diameter with a single mag 13 star at the center (emission-line star Lin 78 = SK 9).  A UHC filter produced a good contrast gain and increased the size to over 2'.  A group of four stars follows including supergiant SK 13 (three brighter in a string and one faint star) and a number of faint stars are scattered nearby.  Forms a similar pair with NGC 249 4.5' WNW.  NGC 267 lies 12' SE.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 261= D 4 = D 21? = h2349 with his 9" reflector on 5 Sep 1826.  Dunlop 4 was described as a "faint round nebula, about 30" diameter" while D 21 was described as a "small round faint nebula." His position for D 21 is just 3' N of ESO 29-12.


John Herschel made 3 observations, first logging "very faint, round, gradually brighter in the middle, 2' across, resolvable." He next described it as "pretty bright, round, 60". Has a star 13th mag in centre. Occurs in a field illuminated by the Nubecular Minor and many stars." His final observation was "pretty faint, round, 90"." Herschel noted this could be either Dunlop 3, 4 or 21.

18" (2/16/07): remarkable view of this detailed emission nebula/cluster at 115x and 220x.  Without a filter at 220x about three dozen stars are visible in the region of the nebula, including a number of faint stars.  At the center of the cluster (IC 1590) and nebula (NGC 281) is the multiple star HD 5005 = Burnham 1, a striking triple with a difficult 4th component at 1.1".  A 13" pair of mag 11.5 stars lie 0.9' SW of Burnham 1.


The nebulosity responds dramatically to a UHC or OIII filter.  The two brightest regions have a butterfly appearance with the two lobes or wings partially divided by a curving dust lane oriented roughly N-S. A fainter detached portion is on the southeast side.  The overall dimensions extend to 15'-18'.  The two lobes are fairly similar in size and surface brightness, though the following section is larger including the southern piece.  The western section has the brightest and most sharply defined edge running along its southern border and oriented E-W.  A long straight dust lane extends along the southern boundary of both lobes and defines the sharp edge on the western lobe.  The curving central dust lane intrudes into the nebula on the south side and nearly divides the two sections, though weak nebulosity connects the two wings.


17.5" (9/28/02): the bright central quadruple (ADS 719 = Burnham 1) includes a mag 8.6/9.1/9.8 trio at 4" and 9".  At 140x, a fainter companion (mag 10) at 1.54" separation is just visible close following the brightest member and is cleanly resolved at 324x.


17.5" (10/17/98): spectacular view of this detailed HII region at 100x using an OIII filter.  This 15' nebulous complex has a mushroom appearance and is separated into three main lobes apparently by dust.  The brightest and largest lobe is following a bright triple star embedded near the center (8.6/9.2/9.8 at 4" and 9").  There appears to be a much fainter detached piece off the south end of this lobe.  Preceding the triple star is a section that is noticeably elongated and irregular in surface brightness fading to the NW.  The section to the north is faintest and separated from the eastern lobe by a curving dark lane.  A dark intrusion, apparently due to obscuring dust, is visible south of the triple star.


13.1" (8/24/84): very large, fascinating nebulosity, very irregular, dark gaps between sections, five brighter stars mag 8.6-12.5 involved.  The brightest star is a very close double.


80mm (2/16/07): at 13x and a UHC filter, the PacMan nebula is easily visible surrounding the central star.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 281 visually on 26 Nov 1881 (Sidereal Messenger, Vol 2, p226 and AN 369, 108, 1884) with his 5-inch refractor at Nashville and recorded a "large, faint nebula, very diffuse, not less than 10' diameter."  IC 11, found around 1892 by Barnard using the 6-inch Cooke refractor at Vanderbilt Observatory in Nashville (probably relayed directly to Dreyer) was placed 30 min of RA west, but Corwin notes that the description "vF, L, triple * on np corner" points to NGC 281 and perhaps he made a transcription error.  IC 1590, discovered by Bigourdan on 31 Oct 1899 is a large, scattered cluster on the west side.  NGC 281 is misclassified as an open cluster in the RNGC, as Barnard made no reference to a cluster.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): this very loose globular appeared fully resolved at 303x.  There were too many stars to possibly count, but certainly several hundred were resolved including a number of relatively bright stars (brightest members mag 12.6).  The core was loosely overlaid with a dozen or so brighter stars.  A number of stars in the halo appeared to be arranged in strings and arcs including one string extending towards the west.


18" (1/1/08): at 220x-280x, ~60 stars were resolved in an 8' diameter.  This globular has a very loose, irregular appearance with a very small brighter core containing a clump of resolved stars.  A string of stars running SSW-NNE runs through the west side of the halo with a brighter star (double) at the NNE end of this string.  A roughly parallel string also passes through the east side of the halo.  Located 1.8° SE of NGC 253 and form a nice pair in the 80mm finder at 13x.


18" (8/25/06): this bright globular is quite loose (concentration class 10) and well-resolved at 220x over the entire face and halo.  The outer halo is very irregular with a scraggly appearance and extends to 8'-10' in diameter.  Roughly 100 stars were resolved in total.


18" (8/23/03): bright but loose globular, well-resolved at 323x into 75-100 stars (difficult to count).  A number of the stars are clearly aligned in long chains.


17.5" (8/29/92): very bright, very large, round, ~8' diameter.  Well-resolved over entire disc into 75-100 stars mag 13-15 at White Mountains over background glow although not densely packed.  60 stars were resolved in a previous observation, only weakly concentrated in core.


13.1" (11/5/83): 30-40 stars resolved over haze.

John Herschel (h2356) has two entries: "I should consider this to be about the main body of the Nubecula Minor, which is here fairly resolved into excessively minute stars, which are however certainly seen with the left eye."  On a later sweep he noted: "Hereabouts seems to be placed the main body of the Nubecula Minor which is a Faint, Rich, Large Cluster of very small stars (12..18) filling many fields, and broken up into many knots, groups, and straggling branches. But the whole is clearly resolved into stars."


Pietro Baracchi observed the region between NGC 220 and NGC 294 over 16 and 17 Dec 1887 using the 48" Melbourne telescope.  Along with discovering a few new objects that went uncredited (Bruck 67 near NGC 294, Kron 25, SMC-N45), he wrote "About this region there is a very large cluster of stars scattered in an irregular way - from 12 to 18.  This covers more than one field ..with the supposed [GC 166 = NGC 294], there are other small groups surrounded by extremely faint nebulosity; and along this space occupied by the objects from A [NGC 220] to N [NGC 294] there are several stars which seem to be nebulous.

D 6 described as "a faint nebula, about 20" diameter" was placed only 5' SE, and may be a duplicate observation.


John Herschel first observed this nebula on 11 Apr 1834, noting "eF.  In a sweep below the Pole."  He added a note later that "This obs give 47 -- instead of 46 -- for the min of RA.  The earlier minute preferred."  On a later sweep, he recorded the RA minute as 46, which was used in the GC and NGC but this is 1.0 min too far west.  JH referenced D 5 as the discovery.

24" (10/1/16): at 375x; faint, small, slightly elongated, 15"-18" diameter, very weak concentration.  Located 6.5' SW of mag 7.8 HD 5801.


NGC 295 is the slightly fainter of a pair with CGCG 501-058 4.8' ENE.  The companion appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 20" diameter, increases to a small bright nucleus and stellar peak, overall fairly high surface brightness.  CGCG 501-058 is situated just 2' SW of mag 7.8 HD 5801 and it helped to place the bright star off the edge of the field.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 295, along with CGCG 501-058, on 26 Oct 1872 while observing the field he assumed was H II 214 (NGC 296).  He found two nebulae and wrote, "(GC) 167 [NGC 296] F, R, *10m (yellow) Pos 29.6 deg, Dist 123.1".  Nova [NGC 295], S, R, and with a * or another neb 10" n. Pos from [NGC 296] 242.0 deg, Dist 314.6" or 21.6 seconds p[receding], 147.6" s[outh]."  Dreyer used WH's (inaccurate) position for NGC 296 to compute a position for the "nova" GC 5123 (future NGC 296) in the GC Supplement and NGC.


There is nothing at Copeland's offset from NGC 296.  A 10th magnitude star is near NGC 296 but it's not at the reported position angle and separation, so it's clear Copeland misidentified the field and Corwin considered NGC 295 as lost.  Confusing the situation further, the computed position for NGC 295 happens to land on NGC 296!  As a result, all modern catalogues label NGC 296 as NGC 295 and UGC 562 is misidentified as NGC 296.


Recently (2016) Yann Pothier was able to identify the correct field about 1° ENE, surrounding mag 7.8 HD 5801 = SAO 54330.  This star is 115" distant in PA 32° from CGCG 501-058, so Copeland assumed this galaxy was NGC 296.  The second object is CGCG 501-056, located 288" in PA 248° (southwest) from CGCG 501-058.  Although Copeland discovered both galaxies, NGC 295 applies to CGCG 501-056 and CGCG 501-058 is left without an NGC designation.

Dreyer used WH's (poor) position to compute the position of NGC 295, found by Ralph Copeland.  See NGC 295 for the story on this number.  Coincidentally, the computed position for NGC 295 lands on NGC 296!  As a result UGC, CGCG, PGC and RNGC misidentify NGC 296 as NGC 295.  In addition, RNGC misidentifies UGC 565 as NGC 296.

18" (11/22/03): this extremely faint and tiny galaxy was a marginal object at 257x, barely glimpsed several times as a fleeting quasi-stellar spot just 1.3' SW of NGC 298.  If this observation is valid, this is one of the faintest NGC galaxies I've recorded.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 297 = m 19 on 27 Sep 1864 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and simply noted "eF".  His position is 2 sec of RA west and 1' S of much brighter m 20 = NGC 298, discovered at the same time.  It's possible that Marth confused a close, faint double situated 2' S of NGC 298 as a nebula.  But 1.3' SW of NGC 298 at 00 54 58.9 -07 20 59 (2000) is a nearly stellar galaxy, described here, which is a more likely candidate.  In any case, NGC 297 is not identical to NGC 298 as stated in the RNGC.  See Corwin's notes.

25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 244x; bright, fairly small, round, high surface brightness, 0.8' diameter. Contains an intensely bright quasi-stellar nucleus.  A few stars were resolved at the edges at 397x.  Brightest in a group of clusters with NGC 306 5' SE, Kron 30 3.7' W, Lindsay 51 8.5' NE, and Kron 28 14' NW.


Lindsay 51 appeared moderately bright, fairly small, irregular shape, ~30" diameter, very small bright nucleus. Situated just 0.6' W of a mag 10.6 star (SMC yellow supergiant) in a rich section of the SMC.


Kron 28 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, round, ~45" diameter, low surface brightness glow extending to the west of mag 10.7 HD 5148 = V Tucanae (mag 10-12 eclipsing binary superimposed at east edge).


18" (7/11/05) - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 50" diameter with a broad weak concentration.  Forms a pair with NGC 306 5' SE.


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x, this SMC cluster appeared as a small, round, bright knot, ~45" diameter. Forms the southeast vertex of an obtuse triangle with two mag 11 stars ~3.5' NNE and 4' W.  Forms a trio with NGC 306 4.7' SE and Kron 30 3.8' W.  Kron 30 appeared as just a hazy patch, ~1.5' diameter with a few mag 13/14 stars superimposed or resolved.


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first of two small knots of stars (the other being NGC 306) located 26' W of NGC 346.  At 171x, it appeared as a small glowing spot, ~40" in diameter, though standing out fairly well in the field.  The cluster is embedded within a scattered group of brighter stars in the field.  Forms a pair with NGC 306 4.7' SE.  The second edition of Uranometria 2000.0 and DSFG incorrectly list both objects twice - as open clusters and bright nebulae.


John Herschel discovered NGC 299 = h2360 on 12 Aug 1834 and recorded this SMC cluster as "F; vS; R; glbM; r; 15"."  His fourth and final record reads "pB, vS, R, 12", resolvable. Situated at the upper limit of the nubecula which here is starry. At the other it is nebulous."


This cluster is misclassified as a Bright Nebula in the RNGC, and the wrong type was copied into the NGC 2000.0 and first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0.

25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): at 187x; bright, extremely large, irregular, elongated roughly 5:3 WNW-ESE, at least 15'x9'.  Contains a large, brighter core region with a mag 11.5 star at the ENE edge of the core.  A mag 9.6 star is in the halo (along a faint spiral arm), 2.6' SW of center and a mag 10.6 star is superimposed in the outer halo, 5.3' SE of center.  Spiral structure was surprisingly subtle.  A low contrast, broad inner arm extends west from the north side of the core, curls south on the west side and spreads out.  A more obvious inner arm emerges from the south side of the core and sweeps east and north, though the root of the arm is not defined.  The arm passes through a relatively bright and large HII patch/OB association, ~25" diameter, situated 3.9' E of center and loses contrast further north.  This giant HII complex is catalogued in NED as NGC 300:[DCL88] 137 from a 1988 study by Deharveng et al, "H II regions in NGC 300".  A mag 11.5 star is 2.3' further NE in the outer halo of the galaxy. I didn't have time to examine the galaxy at higher power to search for additional H II knots.


13.1" (9/22/84): fairly large oval 3:2 WNW-ESE, very diffuse appearance, bright stellar nucleus.  There is a hint of structure although the galaxy has a low surface brightness and was viewed at a low elevation (13° at most) from my latitude of +38.5°.  This nearby galaxy is located at a distance of 6 million light years in the Sculptor group, and may be physically paired with NGC 55.


15x50 IS binoculars: (11/18/06): visible in binoculars as a relatively large, very low surface brightness hazy region, roughly 15' in size.  A star is superimposed on the SW side.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 300 = D 530 = h2359 on 5 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector and described "a pretty large faint nebula, irregular round figure, 6' or 7' diameter, easily resolvable into exceedingly minute stars, with four or five stars of more considerable magnitude; slight compression of stars to the centre." There are several superimposed Milky Way stars, although the resolution towards the center was spurious, of course.  His position was 8' too far east.


John Herschel observed the galaxy on 3 occasions. On the first sweep (1 Sep 1834) he described it as "B; vL; vgpmbM; vmE; irregular figure; 8' to 10' long, 3' or 4' broad; has subordinate nuclei."  His sketch (plate V, figure 10) includes the nucleus and two or three additional regions of nebulosity. Three nights later, he noted it as "faint, very large, very gradually brighter towards the middle; 4' long; 2' broad; has another nebula attached."  The secondary nebula is the large HII complex [DCL88] 137 on the east side.  On 30 Nov 1837 he wrote: "A large oval nebula, containing three stars." He had tentatively identified it with Dunlop 530, but noted: "Mr. Dunlop's neb 530 is described by him as easily resolvable into very minute stars. Its identity with [NGC 300] is therefore very doubtful."


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 300 with the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope on 20 Dec 1875 (plate I, figure 3). The giant HII complex on the east side is clearly shown on the sketch as a distinct oval patch.  Pietro Baracchi showed it on his sketch from 7 Oct 1884 as a relatively large patch making a nearly equilateral triangle with two superimposed stars to the south.  The galaxy was photographed by Harold Knox-Shaw at the Helwan Observatory between 1909-11 and described as a "spiral with many conensations".

This is an unimpressive but fairly distinctive asterism in a very sparse field.  RNGC, PGC and RC 3 incorrectly equate NGC 305 with the galaxy UGC 571.


John Herschel discovered NGC 305 = h76 on 17 Oct 1825 as "a small cluster of p closely scattered stars".  At Herschel's position is a small unimpressive asterism (not a cluster). MCG, RNGC and RC3 misidentify the galaxy UGC 571 as NGC 305.   HyperLeda now shows NGC 305 as stellar (or stars) and NED correctly identifies the number as "six galactic stars".

Sir Robert Ball discovered NGC 308 on 31 Dec 1866 while observing the field of NGC 307.  He recorded a faint "Nova" in PA 147° (SE) at a separation of 60" (measured at 52" on 23 Oct 1876).  In this position (51" separation) is a 15th magnitude star that Ball apparently mistook for a very small nebulous object.


The RNGC misidentified PGC 3354, an extremely faint galaxy 3' SSW of NGC 307, as NGC 308, though with a poor position.  PGC also repeated this identification.  I listed this RNGC error in my RNGC Corrections #3.  Interestingly, it's possible PGC 3354 was seen by Robert Ball with the 72" on 8 Nov 1866, but it didn't receive a NGC designation.

At a redshift distance of ~260 million light years, NGC 309 is one of the largest and most luminous spiral galaxies known.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 309 = T I-4 in 1876 with an 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory.  His RA was 10 seconds too small.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 26 Oct 1897 as well as by Howe in 1898-99 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory.

The sketch in the 1861 publication shows two stars encased in a small nebula (labeled as Gamma), but in the 1880 publication there are only two stars.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 317 = Sw. II-11 on 1 Oct 1885 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  His position is 28 sec of RA east and 1' N of PGC 3442.  He mentions a "Double star close following", but he confused the directions as the pair of stars is close preceding.  This galaxy is identified as NGC 317A in the MCG as the close pair are given separate designations.

Johnstone and Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 318 = St XII-7 on the 3 Nov 1855 observation (only) of NGC 315 .  It was noted as "F, S, R." and placed accurately on a sketch in line with NGC 311 and 315.  Édouard Stephan independently found this galaxy on 6 Nov 1882 and listed it as new in his 12th discovery list, missing the earlier GC entry.  Stephan's position is accurate.

R.J. Mitchell observed this irregular galaxy using LdR's 72" on 3 Oct 1856 and recorded "pL, not vF.  Its brightest part is a line running diagonally, and there is a knot at either end.  Perhaps it shaped like an "S".  The galaxy has a distorted appearance on CCD photo.

00 59 05 -72 10 36; Tuc

V = 10.3;  Size 14'x11'


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the largest HII region in the SMC and an amazing sight at 171x using a UHC filter.  The brightest section is a "bar" extending NW-SE with a well-defined edge along the northern side.  Extending from the central region are two sweeping "arms" or extensions, creating an exaggerated "S" appearance similar to a barred spiral galaxy!  The longer but lower surface brightness arm is attached at the southeast end of the central region and broadly sweeps towards the west, below the bar.  The shorter, but high surface brightness arm is attached at the northwest end and hooks towards the east.  These extensions increase the diameter to 8'-10' in total size!


Without the filter, the nebula is set in a rich star field (Hodge Association 45) and a number of stars are superimposed or involved with the nebula, some in the center. NGC 346 hosts 33 O-type stars, several in a small clump including a massive 02-type mag 12.8 star and a mag 12.6 O4-type star.  On the NE side is HD 5980, an ultra-luminous mag 11.3 Wolf-Rayet binary (WN4+O7), one of the brightest stars in the SMC. The surrounding region is rich in fainter stars.


NGC 371 is in same low power field 22' NE and NGC 330 lies 21' SW.  The small clusters NGC 306 and 299 lies 22' WSW and 26' W, respectively.


10x30mm and 15x50mm: NGC 346 is easily visible in binoculars.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 346 = D 25 on 1 Aug 1826 with his 9" speculum reflector and recorded a "pretty large, pretty bright nebula, about 2.25' diameter, irregular round figure, resolvable, very slight condensation, not well defined at the edges.  He observed it on 7 occasions and his position is unusually accurate.


John Herschel gives 5 descriptions in his Cape observations: He first observed it on 11 Apr 1834 as "B, L, pmE, pgmbM, 5', resolvable (ill seen, below the pole)." On a second sweep he called it "Cluster, imperfectly resolved; rather irregular figure; 5' diameter. Not equally condensed about centre; fades imperceptibly; has a double star (12th mag) in centre." His third observation was recorded as "B, L, irregularly round, gmbM, 3' or 4' in extent, fades away insensibly." His next sweep was recorded as "B, L, neb with resolvable centre; irregularly extended into a kind of broad train as in figure, gently graduating away to the borders. 6' diameter." His final observation was logged as "B, L, irregular figure, with a star 13th mag in most compressed part."  His published sketch is in the CGH catalogue on plate IV, figure 6.


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 346 with the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope on 17 Dec 1875, with an "arm" attached on the NW end of bar, hooking to the east.  It also shows a very small knot of stars about 0.8' NE of center (plate I, figure 4 "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885").  He commented, "It is very unlike H.'s drawing and description; indeed I cannot trace any resemblance between that and its present appearance; and were it not for its position, and the fact that L.S. observed and sketched it on 5th February 1870, I should be in great doubt as to its being the proper object. The position, however, accords with that given by Herschel, and Le Sueur's sketch [plate VII, figure 79] is, in its general features, very like mine, so that there is no room for doubting its identity. The central portion is by far the brightest, being a cluster of stars so very distinct that they could almost be counted; and the nebula here also appears the most dense. From this point it proceeds s.f. for almost 1' 30", terminating in a few very faint stars. Towards the n.p. direction it forms a complete bend or hook, and is here very faint. A little n.f. the main or central portion is a very small and faint round patch, which at times looks like a cluster of very faint stars, but I cannot with certainty determine whether or not it be stars or only nebula, although the night is an exquisite one, being clear and steady."


Although a spectrum taken in 1919 at the Cordoba Observatory of Argentina clearly revealed a gaseous spectrum, Charles Perrine declared "the first true spiral which I have encountered that appears appears to consist almost wholly of gaseous nebulosity." (confusing the spiral morphology with a spiral galaxy).

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 228x, NGC 362 appeared very bright and well-resolved into a couple of hundred stars!  The rich halo was plastered with stars and extended to nearly 8’ diameter.  The 2' compressed core was well-concentrated to a blazing center (concentration class III).  Stars appeared to stream out of the core in curving spiral lanes.  This globular had a classic symmetric appearance with a prominent, round core and halo.  NGC 362 is situated just north of the SMC, though 47 Tuc (NGC 104) overshadows the splendor of NGC 362.


Naked-eye (11/4/12 - Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand): this 6.6-magnitude globular was just visible naked-eye to the north of the SMC.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 362 = D 62 on 1 Aug 1826 with a 9" speculum reflector and described "a beautiful bright round nebula, about 4' diameter, exceedingly condensed. This is a good representation of the 2nd of the Connaissance des Temps [M2] in figure, colour, and distance; it is but a very little easier resolved, rather a brighter white, and perhaps more compact and globular. This is a beautiful globe of white light; resolvable; the stars are very little scattered."  He observed the globular 11 times (sketched in Figure 3 of his catalogue) and his published position is just 2' NE of center.


John Herschel (h2375) reported it with his 18" reflector from the Cape of Good Hope on 12 Aug 1834 as a "Fine, highly condensed globular cluster; psbM; diameter 4'." On 3 Nov 1834 he called it "vB; vL; psvmbM; round; 5' or 6' diameter; all resolved." Observing the next night, he recorded it as "a globular cluster; vB; vlE; gvmbM. Diameter of more condensed part approx. 60 sec in RA; but there are loose stars to a considerably greater distance, stars 13 or 14 mag all nearly equal and distinct, but run into a blaze in centre." His final observation reads: "globular cluster, vB, very compact; psvmb; 4' across; all resolved into stars 13..15 magnitude."


There was a 1.0 tmin error in reduction in the NGC position too far west (Dreyer, IC 2 notes).  This error was noted in Harvard College Observatory NGC corrections.

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 370 is possibly equal to NGC 372.  This is a triple star found by Dreyer at Birr Castle on 12 Dec 1876 at a mean position of 01 06 44.6 +32 25 43 (2000).  The triplet is about 10 seconds of time greater and 1' further north than d'Arrest's position and the separation for the north-south pair is close to his estimate.

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, NGC 371 is a fairly bright, prominent, round SMC nebulous cluster, up to 6' in diameter with a fairly well-defined edge.  The haze has a pretty consistent high surface brightness and seems suspended in a large, scattered cluster or star cloud (Hodge Association 53).  A 5' string of four mag 10-11 stars oriented NW-SE is superimposed on the glow (one is mag 13.0 WR star SMC AB 7) as well as a number of fainter stars.  SMC AB 6, another mag 12 WR binary, is at the south end.  This is an excellent low power field with the striking HII region NGC 346 22' WSW and NGC 395/IC 1624 8'-10' NE.


10x30mm and 15x50mm IS binoculars: easily visible along with NGC 346.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 371 = D 31 = h2376 on 1 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta and recorded "a pretty large unequally bright nebula, about 5' diameter, round figure, resolvable into stars of mixt magnitudes."  He made 5 observations and his published position is 8' too far south.


John Herschel made 5 observations beginning on 11 Apr 1834, recording "cluster, 6th class; faint, round, 10' diameter, stars 15..18th mag."  The next observation was logged as "vF, L, p rich cluster, 6th class. Stars 14..15th mag." On a third sweep he noted it as "a F, L, p compressed cl of 6th class. 10' diameter. gbM; stars 12..16th mag - in some parts almost nebulous." The fourth observation was recorded as a "cluster 6th class; stars 12..15th mag, a few = 10th mag and one of 9th mag; much compressed in the middle; fills field and has loose straggling lines and crooks branching off." The final sweep was recorded as "F, L, cl; little compressed; gbM; 7' diam; resolved into stars 14..16th mag."  Herschel noted that this may be Dunlop 31.

The brightest component of the triple is at the north vertex and the other two are mag 15-15.5.  NGC 370 may also refer to this multiple star.


J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 372 on 12 Dec 1876 with the 72" at Birr Castle and stated "the last nova [GC 5146 = NGC 372] looks at first sight like a hazy *, the higher power seems to resolve it, at all events sev luminous points were seen.

J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 373 on 12 Dec 1876 using the 72" at Birr Castle in the NGC 383 group.  His description is simply "vF, vS" but he accurately placed it 428" in PA 225.8° with respect to a mag 12.2 star situated SSW of NGC 382/383.  This offset matches PGC 3946.  This is one of 8 galaxies in the Pisces Group discovered at Birr Castle.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, described this object as a double nebulous star (there appears to be a very faint star at the NW edge) and Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 NGC Corrections list, states "nebula + star".

Lindsay 60 is 16' ENE (see NGC 419 for notes) and Lindsay 66 is 18' NW.  The latter resolved into three brighter stars in a small string oriented WSW-NNE [length of 21"].

17.5" (8/16/93): 40 stars mag 11-15 in loose 6' diameter, stands out best at 100x.  The brightest mag 10.8 star is part of a triple along the north side.  Fairly uniform in mag 12/13 stars with a scattering of faint stars, fairly even distribution with no rich regions.  Not recognizable as a cluster at 220x.


17.5" (11/2/91): about three dozen stars in 6' diameter, fairly faint, roughly a circular group.  Consists mostly of mag 12/13 stars.  Includes a triple star (10.8/12.5/13 at 8"/~3") and two mag 11 stars on the west side.  Several stars are arranged in strings.  Relatively few stars in center.  A line of mag 10 stars trail off to the north edge of field and the mag 10 star at the end of the string 11' N is a close double star.


8": ~30 stars in a circular group, bright curving string to the north.  A mag 8 star is 10' E.


Caroline Herschel is generally attributed with the discovery of NGC 381 = H VIII-64 on 27 Sep 1783, though according to an article in Aug 2007 S&T, Caroline's discovery preceded Gamma Cass instead of following and likely refers to NGC 189 instead.  Her brother William probably discovered the cluster on 3 Nov 1787 (sweep 774) and noted "a forming cluster of pretty compressed stars."  In his second published catalogued he added "C.H. disc[overy] 1783".

Viewed SN 2000dk, just 5 days after discovery on 9/18/00, as a mag 15.5 "star" at the NW edge of the halo.  At the first glance using 280x, the galaxy appeared elongated in the direction of the SN, but in moments of better seeing, the SN was clearly resolved and similar in brightness to the nucleus of NGC 382.  This galaxy is the fainter of a close pair with NGC 383 in the Pisces group.

The extensions are fairly low surface brightness but appear a bit asymmetric; possibly misaligned at slightly different angles or slightly different widths.  A group of four stars nearly forming a trapezoid is close south.  Located ~30' NE of the core of the NGC 383 group ("Pisces Group") and one of the brightest members of the cluster.


MCG +05-03-071,situated 2' SE, appeared extremely faint, round, only ~8" diameter.


17.5" (12/23/89): moderately bright, moderately large, very elongated 3:1 E-W, bright core, small bright nucleus.  Four mag 10-13 stars are close south.  Brightest of a trio with MCG +05-03-071 = CGCG 501-105 2' SE and NGC 399 8' SW.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 403 on 29 Aug 1862 with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen.  His position (measured on 2 nights) matches UGC 715 = PGC 4111 and he also noted the four stars to the south, measuring the one nearly due south.

William Herschel discovered NGC 407 = H II-219, along with NGC 410 = II-220, on 12 Sep 1784 (sweep 268) and described both as "Two, eF and vS.  The following [NGC 410] the largest."  He gave a single position, roughly between the two galaxies.  Édouard Stephan (XIII-9) independently found the galaxy on 2 Oct 1883 at the Marseille Observatory and published an accurate position.

Herman Schultz discovered NGC 408 = Nova III on 22 Oct 1867 with the 9.6-inch refractor at the Uppsala Observatory.  Schultz placed this object just 8 tsec of RA preceding NGC 410.  At this offset is a mag 14.5 star at 01 10 51.1 +33 09 05 (2000), which almost certainly is his object.  RNGC misidentified PGC 4221 as NGC 408.  This galaxy is 3' SW of NGC 410.  Since Schultz micrometric measurement placed his “nova” due west of NGC 410, the RNGC identification is incorrect.  Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 paper on NGC errata, also came to this conclusion based on Mount Wilson photographs.  Finally, the RNGC has misinterpreted the NGC description to read "406 F 8S" instead of "410 F 8S".  Bigourdan probably observed PGC 4221 (described as almost stellar) although I missed it with my 17.5".  See Malcolm Thompson's "Catalogue Corrections" and my RNGC Corrections #5.

At 128x it appeared fairly small, round, ~1.5' diameter, mottled but with no resolution.  Located 5.3' NW of mag 8.6 HD 7031 and 13' ESE of mag 7.4 HD 6623.


John Herschel discovered NGC 411 = h2384 in Sep 1835 and recorded "vF, pL, R, vlbM; 2'."  His position is accurate.  On a second sweep he recorded a similar description and position, but Harold Corwin found the RA minute (1 tmin too large) was miscopied into his table of "Stars, Nebulae, and Clusters in the Nubecula Minor" and it later received the designations GC 231 and NGC 422.  So, NGC 411 = NGC 422, with NGC 411 the primary designation.  See entry for NGC 422.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 411 = D 56 or D 57 in 1826 with his 9" reflector and described "a small faint nebula" and "a small faint nebula, about 15" diameter."  The first entry is 16.6' SSE of the cluster and the second entry is 19' SE, both far enough off and a vague enough descriptions that neither is very secure.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 412 = LM 1-26 on 15 Oct 1885 with the 26" Clark refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and simply noted "Neb?" There is nothing near Leavenworth's position.  Corwin examined the discovery sketch, but it wasn't of much help and he was unable to recover this object (or even identify it with a star).  ESO lists ESO 541-019 = PGC 3931 as a possible candidate, although this galaxy is 3.8 min of RA west and 19' S of Leavenworth's place.  So, at this time NGC 412 is lost.

17.5" (8/4/97): very faint, diffuse glow located 1.3' SSE of a mag 13.5-14 star. The galaxy is roundish and ~1' in diameter with little or no concentration.  The star to the north is preceded by a mag 14-14.5 star 1.4' W.  The RNGC identification at  01 12 31.5 -02 47 38 is probably incorrect and this number was deleted from DSFG.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 413 = LM 2-301 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His very rough position (to nearest minute of RA and given as doubtful) is 2 tmin west of MCG -01-04-013 = PGC 4347.  This galaxy is not identified as NGC 413 in the MCG.

This is a merged double system with twin nuclei NW-SE, separated by only ~7".  I suspected it to be double at 375x and it was definitely "resolved" at 500x.  The brighter NW nucleus (higher surface brightness) was ~6" diameter and appeared more centered in the halo.  The southeast nucleus (~5" diameter) was nearly attached as a round, tiny "bulge" or knot.

13.1" (9/29/84): faint, thin streak NW-SE, weak concentration.


Herman Schultz discovered NGC 414 = Nova IV on 15 Oct 1866 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  His micrometric position matches UGC 744 = PGC 4254.  This appears to be the only galaxy in the NGC that Schultz was first to discover.  He independently discovered NGC 20, but it was discovered earlier at Birr Castle.  His GC 5096 [later NGC 90] was also found earlier at Birr Castle (GC 40).  His GC 6153 [later NGC 7553] was discovered earlier (GC 4913) by Lord Rosse assistant George Stoney and finally NGC 7571 is probably a duplicate of NGC 7597, discovered earlier by Albert Marth.  All of his other NGC objects are single or double stars.


This is a double or merged system with two nuclei.  The companion on the southeast side is catalogued separately as PGC 93079.  Based on Crossley photographs at Lick Observatory, Heber Curtis described NGC 414 as "very small, binuclear.  The almost stellar nuclei are 7" apart in p.a. 142°."

James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 416 = D 42 = D 43? = h2386 in Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "round well-defined nebula, about 30" diameter."  His position is 13.5' SE of the cluster and with a number of other nearby entries that are either spurious or with poor positions, this identification is uncertain.  John Herschel made 4 observations at the Cape with the earliest on 11 Apr 1834 recording "F; S; R; 30".  His other sweeps gave sizes up to 60" and his positions are accurate.

James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 419 = D 38 (and possibly D 39 and/or D 44) = h2387 on 2 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta, and recorded (for D 38) a "very small oval nebula, a little brighter in the centre; a star of the 8th magnitude south."  Dunlop claimed two observations of D38, two of D39 and one of D44.  His position for D 38 is 7.8' SSE and for D 44 16' NE (Glen Cozens found a typo in the RA) of this SMC cluster.  John Herschel reported 4 observations in his Cape catalogue, first recording the cluster on 11 Apr 1834 as "pB; pL; R; 2'. Has two stars near".  His position and description is very accurate.

William Herschel discovered NGC 421 = H III-155, along with NGC 420 = III-154 on 12 Sep 1784 (sweep 268) and logged both as "Two. Both eF, vS. The following [NGC 421] is the largest."  Dreyer notes there was no mention in the sweep of the separation between the objects and that only a single galaxy was observed by JH, Bigourdan, and at Birr Castle.  Perhaps William Herschel thought that NGC 420 was double?  In any case, although the original description seems to imply that NGC 421 should be the number of the single galaxy here, everyone has assigned NGC 420 to the galaxy.  See Corwin's notes for further discussion.

See observing notes for NGC 411.  The cluster previously assumed to be NGC 422 is IC 1641 and my notes for this cluster are copied below --

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very faint, small, 30" diameter, low surface brightness and no hint of resolution.  Follows NGC 411 by 7' and forms the eastern vertex of an equilateral triangle with NGC 411 and a mag 8 star 6' SW.  Observation made through thin haze.


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this faint SMC cluster is located 7' following NGC 411.  At 228x it appeared as just a very faint knot, less than 1' diameter with a low surface brightness and no resolution.  Located 5.5' NE of mag 8.6 HD 7031.


John Herschel discovered NGC 422 in 1836 with his 20-foot (18") reflector and it was included as #162 in his catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae, and Clusters in the Nubecula Minor".  His position was 30 seconds of RA west (very small offset at this declination) of ESO 051-SC022 = Kron 65 = Lindsay 87, the faint cluster taken as NGC 422 by all modern sources (ESO, NED, SIMBAD, etc).


But Harold Corwin found that the entry #162 in "Stars, Nebulae, and Clusters in the Nubecula Minor" actually derives from Herschel's second observation of NGC 411 = h2384 ("eF; pL; R; glbM 2'.") on sweep 745 (5 Nov 1836) though he accidentally increased the RA by 1.0 tmin.  So, NGC 411 has two entries in this table (both indicated as deriving from a sweep with his 18") -- #162, which is 1.0 tmin too large, and #157, which was copied correctly.  Entry #162 later acquired the numbers GC 231 and NGC 422.  So, NGC 422 = NGC 411 with NGC 411 the primary designation.


The cluster previously assumed to be NGC 422 was later discovered by DeLisle Stewart on plates taken in 1900 at Harvard's station in Arequipa, Peru and received the designation IC 1641.  Instead, IC 1641 has been misidentified as a very faint cluster (Hodge-Wright 62) just following the real IC 1641.  See Corwin's notes for more.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 446 = m 38 on 23 Oct 1864 with Lassell's 48-inch on Malta and recorded "F, vS, stellar".  There is nothing at Marth's position but Corwin suggests NGC 446 = UGC 818 = PGC 4578, located exactly 1.0 min of RA east of Marth's position.  Javelle independently discovered this galaxy on 20 Aug 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at Nice, placed it correctly, and it was catalogued again as IC 89.  UGC, CGCG, MCG and RC3 use IC 89 as the primary designation for this galaxy.  Karl Reinmuth also makes the equivalence NGC 446 = IC 89 and gives the IC position.  UGC, CGCG (411-010) and RNGC identify UGC 794 = PGC 4494 as NGC 446.  This galaxy is located 13 sec of RA east and 7' north of UGC 794, which would require random errors in both directions by Marth instead of a single digit error.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 447 = Au 11 on 8 Oct 1861with the 11-inch Fraunhofer refractor in Copenhagen.  His position (measured on 4 nights) is accurate and he noted the mag 11 star that follows by 9.2 seconds of RA and 110" north as well as an involved star about 18-19th magnitude (the star is closer to mag 15).  Auwers included this discovery in his 1862 list of 50 new nebulae.


Barnard independently found this galaxy visually, along with NGC 451, on 25 Oct 1888 using the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted the "nebula is s.p. comparison star [mag 6 HD 7578] and close n.p. a small star.  A 9 1/2m star is s.f. 3'+/- [should read n.f.], a 12m star is s.f. 1/4'."  His offset in RA from the bright star (~40 seconds of time) matches NGC 447, though his declination is 1.4' too far north (similar offset as IC 1661 = NGC 451).  He reported the discovery directly to Dreyer who recatalogued it as IC 1656.  So, NGC 447 = IC 1656. In Barnard's notebook, he later added the comment "This is NGC 447.  The star is wrongly located in NGC."  See NGC 443 = IC 1653 and NGC 451 = IC 1661 for more duplicate IC entries.


Based on the NGC positions, the RNGC has reversed the identifications of NGC 447 and NGC 449 whose correct orientations should be SW-NE.  UGC and CGCG misidentify NGC 447 = PGC 4550 as NGC 449 = IC 1656 and NGC 449 is misidentified as IC 1661 in CGCG.  MCG identifies these galaxies correctly.  These errors were noted in my RNGC Corrections #3 and Corwin's notes.

48" (10/22/11): at 610x this double system is dominated by NGC 450, which appeared bright, large, 2.3' diameter. Sharply concentrated with a relatively large 30" bright core, surrounded by a very large, low surface brightness halo.  The halo is slightly asymmetric and more extensive on the west side.


Three faint "stars" are superimposed on the east side of the galaxy; two appeared stellar, but the faintest and most westerly object was clearly "soft" at 610x.  These are apparently HII knots in the galaxy and the southeast object is listed in NED as UM 311 from the University of Michigan Emission Line Survey.


NGC 450 has a very close companion, UGC 807, which is attached at the northeast side of the halo, 1.4' between centers.  UGC 807 appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 0.7'x0.3', even surface brightness except for a very small brighter nucleus.  Despite the fact that UGC 807 appears to form a double system, the companion has a redshift that is over 6x greater than NGC 450, so they are a line-of-sight pair.

25" (10/15/17 - OzSky): NGC 454 was resolved into a neat contact double system at 244x [28" separation between centers], though better viewed at 397x.  The main component is on the east side and appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated ~2:1 E-W, ~50"x25".  At 397x it was sharply concentrated with an extremely high surface brightness elongated core and stellar nucleus. The interacting companion, PGC 4461, appears as an appendage, poking out of the southwest side and was easily seen at 397x. It appeared faint or fairly faint, small, probably elongated ~3:2 N-S, ~20"x14".  On the DSS, this galaxy is highly disrupted with plumes and knots.  A mag 11.9 star lies 1.6' NNW.

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first of an unusual chain of three nebulous clusters with NGC 460 and NGC 465 within 10'.  The best view of the entire group was at 171x using an UHC filter.  At 220x the largest in the trio is NGC 456, appearing as a roundish 3' glow with a very small knot embedded in the SE end (SMC-N83A).  A few stars are superimposed (Hodge Association 61) on the glow.  NGC 460 lies 4' ESE.  Visible in 10x30 IS binoculars.


James Dunlop probably discovered  NGC 456 = D 7 = h2399 on 1 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector and described "a faint round nebula, 35" diameter, with a small star near the south margin, but not involved."  D10 is possibly a duplicate observation - the description is similar "an elliptical nebula, about 1' long and 40" broad, with three minute stars in it." and the position is 20' ENE of NGC 456.  John Herschel observed this object on at least 3 sweeps from the Cape as the first of 3 nebulous clusters with NGC 460 (observed 4 times) and NGC 465 (recorded once).  In addition it appears that h2398, which did not enter the GC or NGC is a 4th observation of h2399 = NGC 456 but with a poor RA.  Herschel equated D 7 with h2399.

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the second of three SMC clusters with NGC 456 and NGC 465 in a chain.  At 128x and UHC filter, two close nebulous patches roughly oriented NW-SE were visible, separated by a dusky lane oriented SW-NE.  The total diameter is ~2.5'.  The northwest component, which corresponds with John Herschel's position, has a very small knot or star (SMC-N84A) at the south end.


The fainter southeast section has some stars involved (Lindsay 97), including mag 12.5 Sk 155, a massive O9-type star and mag 14.2 SMC-N84B, an emission-line "star" [resolved by HST as a compact HII knot].  Located 4' ESE of NGC 456 with NGC 465 a similar distance southeast. A mag 10 star is close north.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 460 = D 8? = h2402 in 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "a small oval nebula, about 10" diameter" and his position is just 2' NE of this nebulous cluster.  The close match in position might be a pure coincidence given Dunlop's poor positions.


In any case, this SMC cluster/nebula was discovered by JH on 11 Apr 1834 and observed on 4 sweeps.  Described as the second of three nebulous clusters with NGC 456 (observed 3 times) and NGC 465 (observed once).  JH placed h2402 at a mean position of 01 14 40 -73 18.2 (2000) and this position was used in the GC and NGC.  Nevertheless, the declination given in RNGC, Deep Sky Field Guide (first edition only), NGC 2000.0 and Uranometria 2000 Atlas (first edition only) is one degree too far north.

John Herschel discovered NGC 468 = h98 on 22 Nov 1827 and recorded "vF; eS; stellar."  His position was 3.6' south of IC 92 = CGCG 502-029 = PGC 4780, and this galaxy has been assumed to be NGC 468 until recently.


In March 2015, Harold Corwin checked JH's observing logs (in response to an inquiry from Courtney Seligman about the identity), and found he made an error in reducing the position of NGC 468 by 37 seconds in RA (recording the wrong wire).  Once corrected for an additional 37 seconds, the position of h98 = NGC 468 is a close match with UGC 870 -- a significantly brighter galaxy than IC 92.  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered this galaxy on 29 Aug 1862, measured an accurate position, and it was catalogued as NGC 472.  So, NGC 468 = NGC 472.  By historical discovery, the primary designation should be NGC 468, but this galaxy has been known only as NGC 472 up to this time.  See Corwin's notes for the full story.

48" (10/25/14): very bright, large, elongated 3:2 NNW-SSE, ~1.8'x1.2'.  The bright core contains an intense circular nucleus.  Two spiral arms are visible with the brighter and better defined arm on the southwest side of the core.  It extends ~40" SW-NE and is fairly narrow and straight.  A second matching arm to the northeast of the core also stretches SW-NE, but has a lower contrast.  Neither arm clearly connects to the nucleus, so they appear more as bright arcs.


24" (1/12/13): very bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 1.8'x0.9', high surface brightness.  The halo gradually and weakly increases towards the center and then a sharp increase to a bright, quasi-stellar nucleus.  Forms a 5.5' pair with NGC 474 to the east.  NGC 467 lies 11' SW.

Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 472 on 29 Aug 1862 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His position (measured on 3 nights) and description (he measured the nearby mag 9.7 star as preceding by 14 seconds) corresponds with UGC 870 = PGC 4833.  d'Arrest is credited with the discovery in the GC and NGC, but in Mar 2015 Harold Corwin found that JH's h98 = NGC 468, which had previously been equated with IC 92, actually refers to this galaxy.  So, NGC 472 = NGC 468, with discovery priority to JH.  See NGC 468.

48" (10/25/14): the outer halo of NGC 474 was examined closely at 375x for evidence of the outer, concentric shells and circular streams that are visible on deep images.  Immediately there was a strong sense of arcs from two more different shells. The easiest arc to confirm was the outermost on the eastern side, which curves south from a mag 13.3 star situated 3.3' NE of center.  The arc passes through a mag 16.3 star and extends 30°-40°.  A second outer arc on the northeast side is half the distance (~1.6') to the center.  This arc has a stronger curvature and measures roughly 60°.  Only a single outer arc (slightly more difficult to confirm) was noted on the southwest side, 2'-2.5' from center.  My rough sketch shows it also curving ~60°.  Additional inner arcs or ripples were strongly sensed in the main halo of the galaxy, but too subtle and fleeting to pinpoint locations.  The center is sharply concentrated with a very prominent 1' core.  The core itself is sharply concentrated to a small, blazing nucleus.


24" (1/12/13): bright, very large with a huge very low surface brightness halo, extending roughly 4'x3.5' NW-SE.  Very sharply concentrated with a very bright, slightly oval core, ~1.0'x0.8', which increases to a small intense nucleus.  Largest in a trio with NGC 470 5.5' W and NGC 467 16' SW.


13.1" (8/24/84): fairly bright, small, round, small bright core.  Forms a pair with NGC 470 6' W.  NGC 467 lies 15' SW and NGC 479 is 30' NE.

The fainter eastern component is difficult to cleanly resolve [separation 8"] and it is easy to imagine that Schultz would mistake this oibject as nonstellar.  Located 7' ESE of NGC 499 and 9' WNW of NGC 515 in the field of the NGC 507 Group. The RNGC mislabels PGC 5102 as NGC 510.


Herman Schultz discovered NGC 510 = Nova V on 11 Nov 1866 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  At Schultz's micrometric position (44 seconds following NGC 499) is a close, faint double star (also observed by Bigourdan) with a separation of 8" and mean position of 01 23 55.6 +33 29 49.  The RNGC and PGC misidentify PGC 5102 as NGC 510.  PGC 5102 is 32 sec east in RA and 3' S of NGC 499.  Discussed in  Malcolm Thomson's "Catalogue Corrections".

Located at the NE end of a line of four mag 12-13 stars which extend to SW; the closest mag 13.5 star is 0.9' SW and is followed by a second parallel line of stars.  NGC 512 lies 9' NW.  Incorrect RA by 0.6 minutes west in the RNGC and plotted incorrectly on the U2000.


William Herschel discovered NGC 513 = H III-169 = h111 on 13 Sep 1784 (sweep 271) and simply noted "stellar."  This object is in a large group of galaxies found on this sweep using Beta Andromedae as a reference star.  Seven of these objects have varying errors in RA except for NGC 404. In this case, Herschel's RA is off by ~30 seconds from UGC 953.  John Herschel made the single observation "F; S" in Nov. 1827 (sweep 105) and measured a good position.


The RA in the RNGC is also 0.6 min too far west and the galaxy is misplotted on the first version of Uranometria 2000. The position is given correctly in UGC and RC3.  See Corwin's notes.

48" (10/22/11): the view of this very bright, highly irregular, disrupted galaxy was fascinating at 488x.  The most prominent feature is a very high surface brightness curving "bar" oriented NW-SE (VV 231a), bending out in the middle towards the southwest, and fading out on the southeast end with a faint extension.  The total length of the banana-shaped bar is close to 2.5'.  The brightest part is at the northwest end, where there is a large, bright knot, 24" diameter that increases to the center.  In AJ, 134, 212 (2007), Rossa et all refer to this knot as the northern nucleus. The edge of the bar is very well defined along the north side.  At the southeast end of the main bar, the brightness dims sharply but a much fainter hazy glow continues further southeast (VV 231c) and spreads out.


On the south side is a fairly bright, elongated section oriented WNW-ESE (VV 231b), that is separated from the northern "bar" by a prominent, irregular dark lane running NW to SE, paralleling the bar in the central region. A slightly brighter "knot" is located is the middle of the southern section.  According to the Rossa paper, the dust lane just north of this knot optically obscures the southern nucleus.  At the southeast end, the glow dims rapidly and fans out further southeast.


18" (10/19/06): bright, fairly large, very elongated 3:1 NNW-SSE, 2'x0.6'.  This disturbed galaxy has a very unusual appearance with a bright knot at the NNW end.  The SSE end is wider and fainter and appears to feather out with a fainter, more delicate section that branches from the main body (VV 231b).  The periphery at the SSE end is difficult to trace due to this chaotic structure.


17.5" (1/1/92): fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 3.0'x1.2'.  Very unusual appearance; the NW portion is noticeably brighter with a bright knot at the NW tip and a mottled texture.  Fades towards the SE where it merges into a fainter section which is tilted ~E-W with an irregular surface brightness and ill-defined edges.


8" (11/28/81): faint, diffuse, elongated N-S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 520 = H III-253 = h116 on 13 Dec 1784 (sweep 338) and remarked "eF, cL, E."  On 3 Dec 1787 (sweep 788), he reported "cL, E from sp to nf."  John Herschel reported on 16 Oct 1827, "pB; E like a comet, pos 135°±; 60" length".  Using LdR's 72", Bindon Stoney wrote on 18 Dec 1851, "South end is like a brush or broom with a split in it."  His sketch was included in the 1861 publication (as well as 1880). A second observation on 9 Nov 1876 reads "Lord Rosse thought it had two points of condensation 3/4' apart.  I (Dreyer) thought it spread out in the following end like a fan.  Not well seen."  This galaxy is in Arp's category of disturbed galaxies with interior absorption.

This disrupted galaxy (or merger) appeared very asymmetric, widening a bit at the east end and tapering slightly to the west.  A small, relatively bright knot (HII complex or core of companion?), ~10" diameter, is at the east end.  An easily visible mag 14-14.5 star is embedded at the west end.  The main body, which extends ~40" from the knot to the star, is fairly thin and only very weakly brighter in the center.  With careful viewing, a very faint narrow plume extends west of the main glow.


13.1" (12/22/84): moderately bright, thin edge-on 4:1 ~E-W.  Located north of the NGC 483-517 cluster.


Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 523 on 23 Aug 1862 and described this galaxy as a "Double Nebula, F, S, both very near.  A *11 precedes by 11.65 seconds."  As he noted this object as a "Nebula duplex", he apparently saw the knot at the east end (identified in NED as NGC 523 NED02).  William Herschel probably made the first discovery on 13 Sep 1784 (problematic sweep 271) and simply noted H III-170 = NGC 537 as "stellar".  His RA readings for objects in this sweep are poor (given to the nearest minute) and assuming H III-170 has an error of about 55 sec in RA, then NGC 523 = NGC 537.  The eastern knot was the site of SN 2001EN.

In March 2020, Yann Pothier found that Bindon or George Stoney made an earlier discovery on 7 Nov 1850.  A diagram in the 1880 publication shows two nebulae with distances to nearby stars.  Although the orientation for west is off (it should be down) the separations are a perfect match with NGC 513 (discovered by William Herschel) and NGC 528.  A later observation on 27 Nov 1857 by R.J. Mitchell mentions a similar diagram was made, so NGC 528.was seen twice at Birr Castle before d'Arrest's observation.  Dreyer questioned if the two nebulae were novae but he wasn't left with any positions, so d'Arrest was credited in the NGC.

John Herschel discovered NGC 529 = h118 on 17 Nov 1827 and recorded "pB; vS; sbM.  The preceding of two [NGC 536].   Corwin suggests that NGC 529 = UGC 995 was probably discovered earlier by William Herschel and catalogued as H III-171, but with an error in RA of over 1 minute of time.  But Wolfgang Steinicke argues that III-171 refers to NGC 536, based on analyzing the sweep order.  R.J. Mitchell, LdR's assistant, discovered the other two members of HCG 10 in 1855.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 530 = Sw. VI-9 on 20 Nov 1886 with the 16" refractor at the Warner Observatory.  His position is 15 sec of RA east of UGC 965 = PGC 5210.  This galaxy was found again by Guillaume Bigourdan on 16 Nov 1887, assumed to be new, and reported as Big. 119 (later IC 106). Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1897 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory.  The equivalence of NGC 530 and IC 106 was mentioned in the IC 2 Notes.  MCG identifies this galaxy as IC 106 only (NGC 530 is misidentified as MCG +00-04-122) but UGC states NGC 530 = IC 106.  See Corwin's notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 536 = H III-171 = h120 on 13 Sep 1784 (problematic sweep 271) and simply noted "stellar".  Objects that were discovered on this sweep (NGC 513, 515, 517, 523, 536, 552, 553, 614) have various offset errors in RA.  His position for III-171 is 1.0 min of RA east of UGC 1013.  John Herschel made a single observation in Nov. 1827 (sweep 105) and recorded "pB; pL; gbM; the following of two." His position was accurate.  Heinrich d'Arrest made 3 observations and mentioned the star involved on the north side.


Analyzing the sweep data, Harold Corwin suggests H III-171 applies to NGC 529, which is 1 min 40 sec of RA west of WH's place, but Wolfgang Steinicke argues that III-171 must apply to NGC 536 (coming from the previous object NGC 537 in the sweep).

Dreyer questioned if this object was identical to Heinrich d'Arrest's NGC 523 and these numbers are equated in the RNGC.

There is nothing at this position, but 15' N is ESO 296-026 = PGC 5278, and ESO, SGC and RC3 identify ESO 296-026 = NGC 549. These galaxies were observed on two sweeps and given very accurate positions.


Instead, I suggested that NGC 549 = ESO 296-022 = PGC 5243. This galaxy matches JH's position in declination but his RA would be off by 18 tsec.  Although ESO 296-022 is much smaller and fainter than ESO 296-026, it is closer in position (off only in RA) and a much better match with JH's description "The 4th of a group of 4" [with NGC 534, 544 and 546].  So, although the identification of NGC 549 is not definite, NGC 549 = PGC 5243 appears to be a much better choice.  See Corwin's identification notes.


This identification was suggested by Pietro Baracchi, when he observed the group with the 48" Melbourne telescope on 19 Dec 1887.  He noted "GC 324 [NGC 549] found but out of position...It is eeF; eS; R."  It precedes [NGC 544] by 6s and is 5' 10" north of it.  In this group [GC] 316, 320, 321 agree with Herschel in appearance, relative and absolute position, but 324 [NGC 549] is out altogether.  It agrees very well in appearance but its relative position with regard to the other three objects is quite different.  Herschel observed [NGC 549] only once and the other three were observed twice - it is probable that he made some mistake in placing or connecting the four objects together."

17.5" (12/9/01): this number possibly applies to the mag 15 star just 30" preceding CGCG 502-084, assuming NGC 553 applies to CGCG 502-084.  The star was actually slightly easier to view than the galaxy.


William Herschel discovered NGC 552 = H III-172, along with NGC 553, on 13 Sep 1784 (problematic sweep 271) and noted "Two [with NGC 552 = III-172]. Both vS. stellar, but a little doubtful."  There is nothing near his position and Harold Corwin suggests NGC 552 may apply to a star at 01 26 10.1 +33 24 21, which is just preceding CGCG 502-084 = NGC 553?

This identification is very uncertain due to a poor position by William Herschel.


William Herschel discovered NGC 553 = H III-173, along with NGC 552, on 13 Sep 1784 (problematic sweep 271).  He simply recorded "Two [with NGC 552 = III-172]. Both vS. stellar, but a little doubtful."  There is nothing near his position and RNGC classifies NGC 553 as nonexistent. Dreyer notes the observation by Sir Robert Ball at Birr Castle on 4 Jan 1867 ("Two, perhaps 3 neb, but I had not time to examine the field closely.  Alpha is F, vS; Beta extremely faint; Gamma is doubtful") may refer to other objects.


Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 553 is possibly CGCG 502-084 = PGC 5333.  NGC 552 could apply to the faint star close preceding.  This assumes Herschel's RA is 1.6 min too large, and his dec 3' too far north (his errors in RA were greater as the sweep progressed).  But Wolfgang Steinicke disagrees. He argues that WH's sweep path from III-171 = NGC 536, the previous object in the sweep, is not consistent with CGCG 502-084, which is too far west and south to be seen.  So, perhaps it is best to simply classify NGC 553 and 552 lost.

Aaron Skinner discovered NGC 577 = Sf 100 = T I-7 on 23 Oct 1867 with the 18.5" Clark refractor at the Dearborn Observatory.  Truman Safford published the discovery list 20 years later (1887), so Dreyer didn't notice it in time for Skinner to be credited in the NGC.


Wilhelm Tempel independently found the galaxy on 14 Aug 1877 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and recorded it in both his first discovery list (#7) and his 4th list (#5).  Tempel claimed he found two nebulae 2m 50s following NGC 560 and 564 (there is only a single galaxy at this position), which Dreyer assigned to NGC 577 and NGC 580. His description in the first table reads, "Near the star Lalande 2666, which has in its field the nebulae III 441-42, are still two more nebulae following by 2m 50s, one as bright as the preceding of Herschel's."  In the 4th paper he described only a single nebula, "II class, somewhat brighter than the two preceding nebulae, H III 441, 442 [NGC 560, 564]." Tempel is credited with the discovery of NGC 577 in the NGC.  So, NGC 577 = NGC 580.

See observing notes for NGC 577.


Wilhelm Tempel found NGC 580 = T I-8 on 14 Aug 1877 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory, claiming to see two nebulae 2m 50s following NGC 560 and 564.  The second object was assigned NGC 580. But there is only the single galaxy UGC 1080 = PGC 5628 at this position, so possibly one of his objects was a faint star. NGC 580 is generally equated with NGC 577. Aaron Skinner discovered this galaxy 10 years earlier on 23 Oct 1867 with the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at Dearborn.  As the discovery wasn't published until 1887, Skinner wasn't credited in the NGC.


Lewis Swift found the galaxy again on 20 Nov 1886 and reported it as new in list VI-12.  Dreyer assigned Swift's position to NGC 580 with Swift and Tempel credited in the NGC.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory.

Pierre Méchain discovered M103 = NGC 581 = h126 in April 1781.  Messier added it at the last minute to his 1781 catalogue (published in the 1784 Connaissance des temps), but since the discovery occurred after the manuscript was sent out for publication, he wasn't able to provide visual confirmation or specific coordinates.


William Herschel observed the cluster on 8 Aug 1783 and wrote, "14 or 16 pretty large stars with a great many eS ones. Two of the large ones are double, one of the 1st the other of the 2nd class. The compound eye glass shews a few more that may be taken into the cluster so as to make about 20. I exclude a good many straggling ones, otherwise there would be no knowing where to stop."


John Herschel included M103 in his Slough Catalogue (h126) but only referenced ∑131, Struve's entry (1825) from his catalogue of double stars, so he was apparently unaware of the equivalence with M103. He reported it on 29 Sep 1829 (sweep 213) as "A fine cl; R; rich; rather coarse; 6 or 8' diam; stars 10...11m. One of Struve's "acervi".

E.E. Barnard found this galaxy while observing his comet discovery C/1888 RI with the comet nearly occulting the galaxy!  He commented "The comet's nucleus passed some 30" N of the nucleus of the nebula.  The comet is probably 5 times as bright as the nebula and is a great many times larger."  The discovery was reported directly to Dreyer, who catalogued it again as IC 1712.  As Barnard's position is nearly identical to NGC 584, it's strange Dreyer didn't noticed the equivalence, though Barnard later added in his notebook "NGC 584".

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 594 = LM 1-32 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 12.5, pS, E 225°." His rough position essentially matches MCG -03-05-005 = PGC 5769 and the position angle is close (SW-NE).  Harold Corwin suggests Lewis Swift may have rediscovered this galaxy on 29 Sep 1897 and recorded it in list XII-7 (later IC 1714).  Swift's position is 3 degrees north of NGC 594.

NGC 595 = M33-A62 = BCLMP 49

01 33 33.5 +30 41 31; Tri


18" (12/8/07): fairly bright knot near the core of M33, just 4' NW of center and close west of the spiral arm that winds north from the core on the west side.  Appears elongated SSW-NNE, ~40"x30", with a fairly well-defined outer edge.  This is the second most luminous HII region in M33 after NGC 604.


17.5" (7/5/86): very faint nebulosity in M33, located 4' NW of the center.  Situated just off the west edge of the beginning of the spiral arm that extends north and then northeast from the core on the west side.  This is a combination star cluster and HII region.


13.1" (8/15/82): visible faintly with averted.  Situated at the edge of a spiral arm.


Bindon or George Stoney discovered NGC 595 on 27 Dec 1850 with Lord Rosse's 72" (or perhaps on the 13 Sep 1850 observation, "full of knots") and an offset measured from a star superimposed on M33.  The nebula was labeled as "1" on the diagram in the 1861 publication.  No coordinates were ever measured at Birr Castle.


Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered this HII knot on 1 Oct 1864 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and measured a fairly accurate position (4 seconds of RA too large).  d'Arrest is credited with the discovery in the NGC. Truman Safford rediscovered it on 1 Nov 1866 with the 18.5" refractor at the Dearborn Observatory and recorded Sf 63 as "pF, vS, probably a well-known outlier of M33."

William Herschel discovered NGC 596 = H II-4 = h132 on 13 Dec 1783 (early sweep 44). On 10 Sep 1785 (sweep 435) he logged "pB.  Much like the brightest of the two preceding [NGC 584]; but rather smaller." His summary description from 6 observations reads "pB, pS, R, mbM, resembling a telescopic comet."  John Herschel reported "pB; R; a * 6m follows 47.5 seconds and is 40" north." (sweep 40, 2 Jan 1827).  On 31 Oct 1877, R.J.

V = 5.7;  Size 70.8'x41.7';  Surf Br = 14.2;  PA = 23°


17.5" (11/1/86): bright, very large, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, weakly concentrated irregular halo, rises suddenly to a small bright core.  Two prominent spiral arms form an "S-pattern" with an irregular surface brightness.  At least a dozen HII regions or clusters are resolved (see the numerous IC listings).  Overall, the entire galaxy is very mottled and the outer extent is difficult to define.


13.1" (8/23/84): two prominent spiral arms distinctly visible.


8" (10/4/80): the bright central region is slightly grain with the halo showing some indication of spiral arms.  The edge of the arms were glimpsed with averted vision.


Naked-eye (several times): just glimpsed in very dark skies, perhaps visible 25% of the time in best conditions.


Gioivanni Hodierna probably discovered M33 = NGC 598 = H V-17 = h131 before 1654 and catalogued it as a cloud-like nebulosity or obscuration "near the Triangle".  Charles Messier independently discovered M33 on 25 Aug 1764. William Herschel assumed it was new (not found at Messier's position) and catalogued it as H. V-17 on 11 Sep 1784 (sweep 266).  On 11 Jan 1787 (sweep 680) he noted "The large nebula. The middle of it easily resolvable and some of the stars visible; it is impossible to say how far it may extend; the nebulosity losing itself so gradually, but goes undoubtedly a great way in every direction, but chiefly from sp to nf."  A little later in the sweep he noted "Looked for the 33rd of the Conoiss des Temps, but it is not in the place."


John Herschel included only a single observation in the Slough Catalogue from 15 Sep 1828 (sweep 177): "Enormously L; vgbM.  The nucl taken; has a * 12m, nf the nucl.  The diffused neb extends 15' s[outh] and as much nearly to n[orth].  It has irregularities of light, and even feeble subordinate nuclei [HII knots] and many small stars."


Lord Rosse or assistant George Johnstone Stoney recognized M33 as a spiral on 6 Sep 1849 and his drawing with four or more spiral arms was included in the 1850 PT paper (plate XXXVI, figure 5).  The description reads, "New spiral, s(outh) branch the brightest, none F, nf one short but pB, p(receding) on pretty distinct, sf one but suspected; the whole involved in F neby which probably extends past several knots which lie about it in different directions.  Faint nebulosity seems to extend very far following."  R.J. Mitchell produced a more detailed drawing on 18 Dec 1857 (included in the 1861 publication).  Isaac Roberts produced the first excellent photograph of M33 in 1895 with his 20" reflector, revealing more detail than seen visually.

William Herschel discovered NGC 599 = H II-473 = LM 2-310 on 27 Nov 1785 (sweep 478) and logged "F, S, iF, easily resolvable, some of the stars visible.".  His position is fairly accurate.  This is an S0 galaxy, so I wouldn't expect that Herschel would find it mottled or resolvable.

17.5" (9/26/92): faint, fairly large, round, 2.5' diameter.  Appears as a low surface brightness glow without core or structure.


William Herschel discovered NGC 600 = H III-432 on 10 Sep 1785 (sweep 435) and simply noted as "eF".  John Herschel made no observations of this low surface brightness galaxy and it was probably missed at Birr Castle.  The single observation on 29 Nov 1850 with Lord Rosse's 72" commented "searched for 20' sf [NGC 596], doubtful whether found, perhaps it was a vF stellar object 2.5' S of a *13m and about 6' S of a *10m."  This appears to refer to a 15th mag star and not the galaxy.


Based on photographs taken at the Helwan Observatory between 1914-16, NGC 600 was described as "vF, 2' x 1', nucleus elongated 20°, giving this spiral an almost Phi-type [barred] appearance."

Frank Muller discovered NGC 601 = LM 2-311 (close southeast of II-310 = NGC 599) in 1886 using the 16" Clark refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His position is just 5 sec of RA west of PGC 73980 and his PA of 115° with respect to NGC 599 is within 5° of the correct value.  Bigourdan missed this object and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  PGC 73980 is not catalogued in the MCG or RC3, but is included in Harold Corwin's Southern Equatorial Galaxy Catalogue (ESGC).  It appears virtually stellar on the POSS with a slightly "soft" appearance.  PGC equates NGC 599 = NGC 601.

NGC 602 = SMC-N90 = ESO 029-43 = Lindsay 105 = SMC Ass 68

01 29 26 -73 33 36; Hyi

Size 3'


25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 244x; NGC 602 is a large nebulous cluster (SMC-N90) that was clearly brighter on the southeast end.  The total size is ~3' with the southeast end fairly bright, fairly large, irregular shape.  A tight knot of three stars is near the center. Additional stars are involved near the edges.  A weak dust lane was on the west end oriented SW-NE, separating the roundish western section.  A mag 13.8 star (O3-type Sk 183) is involved just west of the dust lane. This star is one of the massive O-type stars in the SMC and the dominant ionizing source of the nebula.  The two portions are separated (barely) without a filter but tangent when I added a NPB filter.  A mag 12.5 star is off the SW side (1.8' from center) and a mag 13 star is off the north side, 2.2' NNW of center.  NGC 602, along with N89 and N88 to the northwest, are situated along the boundary of SMC-1 (also called SMC-SGS 1), the only supergiant shell in the SMC, with a diameter of ~1°..


SMC-N89, located 20' NW, is fairly faint, large, roundish, irregular glow, ~3.5' diameter.  At the northeast end are four mag 11.5/12/12.5/13 stars (part of Hodge association 67) in a near equilateral triangle with a 4th star at the center and a 12th mag star is at the E or SE end of the nebulosity.   Lindsay 104 is a very faint, unresolved patch (cluster) just southwest of the four distinctive stars. Situated at the western boundary of SMC-1.


SMC-N88, located 33' NW, is dominated by a Highly Ionized Blob (HEB) of only 3.5" diameter and mag ~12.5.  At 244x + NPB filter it appeared as a bright "star" or quasi-stellar object surrounded by faint nebulosity on the east and south side.  I assume there was a contrast gain with the filter as this dense, high-excitation object has a ratio of O III lines/H-beta > 10.5.   The nebula is surrounded by Hodge Assoication 64 including a mag 14 star 2' E, two close mag 14 stars 1.8' SE and a mag 14.5 star 1' SSE.  A mag 11.2 star (part of Hodge Associatin 65) lies 5.6' S.  Situated at the NW edge of supershell SMC-1.


18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, a knot of stars is embedded in a 3' fairly bright oval nebula (Henize N90).  On closer inspection the knot of stars is offset to the SE side of the nebula.  At 171x and UHC filter, the nebulosity is fairly bright and clearly locally brighter on the SE end around the knot of stars.  A weak dark rift, running SW-NE, separates the fainter portion of nebulosity to the NW.  This nebulous cluster is an outlying member of the SMC.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 602 = D 17 = h2421 on 1 Aug 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector and described "a faint round nebula, about 2' diameter, a very little brighter in the middle, with some minute stars in it."  Dunlop's position is just 3' E of this SMC cluster.


On his first sweep on 11 Apr 1834, John Herschel logged "pB, S, irregularly round, psb but not to the middle, but rather to a point near the southern edge. Is decidedly resolved, and has scattered stars. (This is an outlier of the Nubecula Minor)".  On a second sweep he called it "B, R or lE, psbM to a star; has also a star involved which looks like a second nucleus and several small stars about it."  JH credited Dunlop with the discovery.


Joseph Turner observed this object on 26 Jan 1879 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope and noted there was clearly a double star in the center.

17.5" (9/28/02): identified at 162x as a slightly fuzzy glow and cleanly resolved into a faint triple star at 325x (7.5mm Tak and Paracorr).  Situated ~30' SE of the core of M33.


17.5" (8/11/96): this is a faint, close triple star within M33 described as a "A south neb. or Cl. with 3 st in it" by Lord Rosse.  It appeared as a faint nebulous spot at low power and was barely resolved at 220x.  The trio of mag 14/15 stars was cleanly resolved at 410x.  The maximum separation is 15", the close pair at 9" separation and the other side 12" with the trio forming a 3-4-5 right triangle!  Located 28' SE of the center of M33.


Johnstone and Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 603 on 29 Nov 1850.  It was recorded as "A S neb. or Cl. with 3 st in it.  It is about 8' ssp a [double star] whose components are of the 11 m.  RA 1h 26m +/- NPD 60d 35' +/-.  (I obs)."  This description pins down the identification as a triple star whose components have a maximum separation of 15".  This identification was noted by Mayall and Aller (1942) in the article "The Rotation of the Spiral Nebula Messier 33," ApJ, 95, pp. 5-23.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, states "Cl of 3 st 14".  In the IC 2 notes, Dreyer mentioned he only saw an extremely faint star on plates of M33.  See Corwin's Notes.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): this very large barred spiral was a stunning showpiece at 303x!  The bright central bar region is oriented NW-SE and extends ~2.5'x1' with the halo and arms stretching ~5'x3.6'.  The central region was sharply concentrated with a very intense oval core that increased to a bright stellar nucleus.  A prominent spiral arm was easily visible on the southeast end.  It had a well defined edge and a high contrast as it emerged from the central region and unfurled east and north.  The arm then dimmed significantly but could be followed as it bent backwards on the east side towards the northwest!  The arm faded away before reaching a mag 9.6 star (SAO 167149) 2.2' NE of center.  A second relatively bright, well-defined arm is attached on the northwest end of the bar and it curled south on the west end of the halo.


17.5" (12/4/93): fairly bright, very elongated 3:1 WNW-ESE, 4.0'x1.3', prominent elongated core, almost stellar nucleus with direct vision.  The halo is broader with averted vision. There appeared to be a very faint extension or large knot southeast of the core . The DSS reveals this feature to be the bright spiral arm extending southeast from the central bar.  Located 2.4' SW of mag 9 SAO 167149.


8" (11/28/81): faint, moderately large, diffuse, small bright core. A mag 9 star lies 2.5' NE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 613 = H I-281 = h139 = h2422 on 9 Dec 1798 (sweep 1084) and recorded "cB, E np-sf, 5 or 6' long, 1 1/2' broad, a nucleus in the middle, A pretty considerable star is about 3' north of it, and a little following." James Dunlop independently found the galaxy on 5 Aug 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector and recorded "a very small round nebula, about 15" diameter, pretty well defined, bright at the center." Stephen O'Meara notes it is curious that Dunlop failed to note any elongation and didn't mention its proximity to the 10th magnitude star just off its NE flank.


John Herschel observed the galaxy both at Slough and at the Cape of Good Hope.  On 27 Sep 1834, his Cape observation reads "vB; vL; vmE; pos 118.3 ; 1st gradually then suddenly much brighter to the middle to a nucleus 4' long 1.5' broad, has a star 9th mag N.f."  He also noted that the position assigned in his Slough Catalogue was incorrect.  On a second sweep, he logged "pB; vmE; pslbM, 2 1/2' length.

John Herschel discovered NGC 618 = h136 on 16 Nov 1827 and reported "pB; pL; bM; precedes a * 2m 51.0s".  There is nothing at his position and there is no fairly bright star at the required separation east of his position. In the NGC Notes section, Dreyer commented "never found at Birr [in 5 attempts], nor by d'Arrest [in several attempts].  Schönfeld (II) has two observations, vF, eS = *13, place agreeing with [John Herschel].  Query: only a faint star..."   In the IC 1 Notes and Corrections entry for NGC 618 and 627, Dreyer adds "Not observed by John Herschel in the same sweep as [NGC 608 and 614].  Neither of them seen by Burnham."


Wolfgang Steinicke suggests NGC 618 may be a mag 10 star at 01 41 36.6 +33 17 40 (J2000) with a mag 12.7 star 30" southwest and a mag 15.7 star 30" south.  Harold Corwin is skeptical that this combo would mimic a "pretty bright" nebula and suggests that NGC 618 is possibly a duplicate observation of NGC 614, although the brighter star following is not at the required separation, unless Herschel meant 51 seconds, instead of 2m 51s.  Wolfgang Steinicke analyzed the sweep data and arrived at a different position, close to 01 42 +33° 23' (J2000), assuming the bright star precedes the object, but this "corrected" position has no "pB" objects nearby.

John Herschel discovered NGC 627 = h141 on 11 Nov 1827 and recorded "vF; R; another precedes; which must be III.174 [NGC 614].  The RA conjectural and PD liable to some error."  Heinrich d'Arrest was unsuccessful in locating an object at Herschel's position and he commented "is not in the heavens. Anyway, the place assigned [by Herschel] as doubtful, is errant."


Sherburne Burnham (Publ of the Lick Observatory, Vol II) was also unable to find the object and Dreyer concluded "should be struck out" in the IC 1 notes section.  Burnham suggested this might be a duplicate observation of NGC 614 in which case the object that preceded would be NGC 608 (misidentified as III 174).  But Wolfgang Steinicke argues that NGC 614 is located 2.4° due north of ∑137, the previous object in the sweep, so he could not have arrived at the field of NGC 614 as the next object.

V = 9.4;  Size 10.5'x9.5';  Surf Br = 14.2


48" (10/22/11): beautiful face-on spiral with long, graceful arms wrapping around an intense 1' core that increases towards the center, but there is no sharp nucleus.  At first glance at 375x there appeared to be four arms, but with a more careful look there are two main arms that each wrap more than 360° around the core as well as a couple of side branches.  Each arm is studded with a number of non-stellar HII regions that highlight the arms.  In addition, a number of stars are superimposed, both in the inner region (two faint stars are within 25" of the center) and around the edge of the halo, which extends to 7'-8' diameter.


The more prominent arm "southern" arm is very regular - emerging from the core on the south side and wrapping counterclockwise around the core to the north, unwinding gradually as it curves to the east and then pulls away from the central region more suddenly on the south side.  This arm is very patchy and delineated by a large number of HII knots with the two most prominent ones near the outer southern end.  The "northern" arm begins to emerge from north of the core, tightly wraps counterclockwise around the core, passing near or through a few superimposed stars on the south side of the core, unwinding more as it stretches again to the north.  The arm structure is a bit more complex on the north side due to side branches and the embedded HII knots are more scattered.


The HII regions were viewed more carefully at 610x.  The following identifications are from Paul Hodge's 1976 "HII regions in NGC 628" (ApJ, 205, 728), which lists over 700 HII knots.  The brightest is #627, near the end of the outer southern arm 2.7' SSW of center. It appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, ~20" diameter.  Moving clockwise along this arm towards the core, the next prominent knot is #598 situated 2.2' SSE of center.  It was slightly fainter than #627, round, 15" diameter.  Next in line is #552, a faint round knot of 10" situated 1.8' SE of center.  East of the core by 1.5' is #406, a very faint, round 10" knot situated 36" S of a superimposed mag 14.5 star.  Just 30" W of this star and 1.2' NE of center is #292, a fairly faint, very small knot, ~8" diameter.  Continuing inward along this arm, the next knot is #196, a very faint hazy spot 1.3' N of center.  Finally, less than 1' NW of center is another very faint patch with multiple Hodge numbers #260-268.


There were no notable knots on the inner southern portion of the northern arm, but a noticeable clump of knots is on the NW portion of this arm.  First was #167/168, a faint 10" knot 1.6' NW of center.  Continuing outward 2.0' NNW of center is a faint, elongated patch, ~25" diameter, consisting of #91-95 and #49 at the north end of the glow.  I didn't search the outer region of the halo for additional HII knots, except noted #330, a 10" knot situated between two mag 12-13 stars at the eastern edge of halo, 3.9' from center.


17.5" (8/31/86): bright, large, round, very bright core.  A spiral arm is attached at the east side of core winding towards the west along the south side.  A dark gap is visible between the arm and the main central portion.  Several stars are superimposed in the halo.


13.1" (8/24/84): very prominent, fairly small bright core surrounded by a very large, diffuse glow.  Visible in 16x80 finder.


8" (8/24/84): very small bright core surrounded by a large faint halo.


Pierre Méchain discovered M74 = NGC 628 = h142 in September 1780.  William Herschel made several observations of M74 in which he claimed to partially resolve it into a number of extremely faint stars.  On 14 Oct 1784 (sweep 289) he logged, "easily resolvable; some stars visible in it, the coma eF at the edges and not resolvable."


On 13 Dec 1848, Lord Rosse and/or assistant Johnstone Stoney detected spiral structure with the 72" and noted "Rough sketch made. Spiral?"  The next night he "confirmed last night's observations; feel confident it is a spiral."  LdR classified M74 as "Spiral or curvilinear" in his 1850 paper.

There is also a wider trio of stars which follows by 6', but this is a courser, less interesting group in the field and less likely to fit Struve's description "3*+ neb".

John Herschel discovered NGC 643 = h2435 on 18 Sep 1835 and logged "eF, R, vglbM, 40"."


In 1957, Gerard de Vaucouleurs concluded (based on Mt Stromlo plates) that NGC 643 was an outlying cluster of the Small Magellanic Cloud and not a galaxy as listed in the 1932 Shapley-Ames Catalogue.  Eric Lindsay independently listed it as a new cluster (not making the connection initially with NGC 643) in his 1958 paper on SMC clusters and described it from a 30 minute ADH plate (South Africa) as "a conspicuous object, clearly recognizable as a cluster with 20-30 faint resolved stars.  The texture and distribution of the outlying stars suggest it is globular; otherwise it would have been classified as certainly open."  NGC 643 was deleted from de Vaucouleur's 1964 Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies and Alan Sandage's 1981 revision of the S-A Catalogue.  RNGC gives the type as 28 (cluster in the LMC) instead of 29 (cluster in the SMC).  NGC 2000.0 classifies it as a globular cluster.

18" (10/19/06): superb view at 225x using a UHC filter.  The main bi-polar body was very bright, elongated ~SW-NE and dominated by two large, irregular knots at either end.  The SW knot is brighter and the brightest portion is more elongated in the direction of the minor axis.  Both knots are somewhat irregular in shape and brightness.  A faint star is just off the SW end. The two bright knots are attached with a fainter bridge of nebulosity. Extending off the north end is a large "arm" that sweeps around towards the west and a slightly less obvious counterpart is attached at the south end and sweeps towards the east.  The overall effect mimics a photograph of a barred spiral galaxy or perhaps a rotating sprinkler head with jets of water curving away.


17.5" (8/2/86): bright, fairly large, consists of two prominent irregular lobes with a darker center; the SW lobe is brighter with straight edges while the NE lobe has a slightly curved edge.  A mag 13.5 star is attached at the southern edge of the SW lobe.  Extending from the main body of this striking bipolar planetary is a large halo that contains two large outer arms or wings similar to a spiral galaxy!  The outer "arm" attached at the NE end is brighter and longer and curves to the west.  The southern extension is short, fainter and less defined.  The general features described above were clearly seen in my 13.1" at 166x using an OIII filter on 10/10/86.


13.1": SW end is brighter while the NE end is slightly curved.  Boxy appearance with a dark center.


80mm (1/20/07): at 12.5x appears as a very faint, very small low surface brightness spot that blinks well using an OIII filter and increases significantly in contrast.  At 25x and OIII filter appears as a fairly faint, round knot with a fairly high surface brightness.


Pierre Méchain discovered M76 = NGC 650 = H I-193 on 5 Sept 1780 with a 3" refractor.  William Herschel described the planetary on 12 Nov 1787 as "Two close together, their nebulosities run into each other; distance of their centers is 1 1/2 or 2'."  The second nebula was catalogued as NGC 651.


Sir Robert Ball described M76 in detail on 5 Nov 1866 using the 72" at Birr Castle: "remarkable object; a new spiral possessing details of interest.  Previous observation as to form confirmed with some further particulars well seen in single lens.  It consists principally of the two B knots which according to Herschel are the pair of double nebula, and third much fainter knot p the other two.  Form compared to a reaping hook.  Sketched by Lord Oxmantown.  The nebulosity terminates very suddenly on the s edge where there is a star, probably distinct from, through very close to the nebulosity.  A branch of nebulosity in the foll direction was suspected by both observes preceding from between the two knots."


Based on a Crossley photograph, Curtis (1918) described, "central star of mag 16.  Quite irregular, but evidently to be included as one of the larger members of the planetary class.  The central and brighter portion of the nebula is an irregular, patchy oblong 87"x42" in pa 40° from the ends of which faint, irregular, ring-like wisps extend total length 157" in pa 128°.  Brightest patch at southern end of central part."


The nickname "Little Dumbbell" was used by Leland Copeland in a Feb. 1960 Sky & Telescope article "An Amateur's Tour of Planetary Nebulae"

The galaxy is fainter and wider on the southwest portion of the bar.  The central region in mottled and dusty, but I didn't notice the X-shaped dust lanes visible on photos.  At the southwest end, a broad low surface brightness spiral arm emerges and sweeps south, curving slightly east for a length of 2'.  A second faint arm begins at the northeast end of the bar and extends north a similar distance, bending gradually to the west.  The arms gave the galaxy a stretched "S" appearance and significantly increased the overall size to ~6.5'x2.5', roughly N-S.

Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 674 on 2 Dec 1861 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and noted "pretty bright, elongated, *14 follows by 8 seconds."  There is nothing at his position, but 2.0 min of RA east is NGC 697 and the description fits!  JH and Dreyer assumed this was a new discovery and catalogued d'Arrest's object as GC 398 = NGC 674.  Curiously, he claims the object was found the same night (4th of 411) that he also observed NGC 697.  Father Hagen and Bigourdan searched fruitlessly for NGC 674 and Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, says "not found, = NGC 697?"  That conclusion is warranted.  See Corwin's notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 676 = H IV-42 = h151 on 30 Sep 1786 (sweep 607) and recorded "a star with vF branches in the direction of the meridian, each branch about 1' in length; the star about 8 or 9 m; other stars of the same size are free from these branches".  Interestingly, he used this example in his 1814 PT paper to argue, not only of the association of the star [very near the center] and the nebula, but that the nebula was brighter near the star because nebulous matter was being drawn by gravity to the star.  John Herschel made two observations and logged on 24 Sep 1830, "a *9m with a vF narrow ray of nebulosity; a most curious object."  The galaxy was observed 4 times at Birr Castle.  On 8 Nov 1876, J.L.E. Dreyer recorded "*9m with pF neb elongated 168.4°, longer on the side of *, concave preceding, convex following."


The 9.5-mag star superimposed at the center is included in the CGCG magnitude (10.5z).  Steinicke notes that the separation from centre is only 9", the smallest value of all cases of bright superimposed stars in the NGC!

01 56 33.9 +33 03 19; Tri


= *, Corwin.  Listed as a faint galaxy 3.6' NW of NGC 736 in RNGC.


Johnstone and Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 733 on 11 Oct 1850.  It was labeled Epsilon in a field sketch. No description was given but the measured position was 115" in PA 293.3 deg (NW) from Alpha [NGC 736].  There is nothing at his exact offset though a mag 15 star is 97" from NGC 736 in PA 296 deg.  Corwin identifies NGC 733 with this star.


RNGC and PGC probably misidentify PGC 7255 as NGC 733.  This small elongated galaxy is located 3.6' NW from NGC 736.  The separation appears to be too large to be a match though the PA = 291d is coincidentally close and the galaxy was (barely) visible in my 17.5".

Size 0.6'x0.4';  PA = 28°


24" (10/3/13): faint to fairly faint, small, round, 18" diameter, low even surface brightness.  Can hold continuously at 375x.  Located 10' SE of mag 5.8 HD 11522.  PGC 7121, identified as NGC 734 in the RNGC and PGC, is located 22' ESE.  PGC 7121 appeared extremely faint, small, slightly elongated, 15"x12", required averted vision.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 734 = LM 1-41 on 9 Nov 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and reported "mag 14.0, vS, R, bMN, *11 p[recedes] 11 sec."  His rough position (nearest minute of RA) happens to be just 3' N of PGC 7121, and this galaxy is identified as NGC 734 in the RNGC and PGC.  The 11th mag star in the description (also shown on his discovery sketch) might refer to a star situated 4.3' WNW (the difference in RA is 17 sec), though a brighter star even closer (3.2' SSE) is not shown on the sketch.  I proposed to Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke that a better candidate for NGC 734 is 2MASX J01532872-1659442 = PGC 170023.  This galaxy is brighter than PGC 7121 and has a star 13 tsec due west.  PGC 170023 is further off in RA from Leavenworth's position than PGC 7121 but is a better match in declination, typical of the Leander McCormick positions.  Corwin agrees with my identification and is now incorporated in NED, but not HyperLeda.

24" (11/24/14): at 375x; fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 36"x15", contains a very small brighter core. A mag 14 star is superimposed on the NW tip.  A mag 10.2 star is 1.5' SW and a mag 12 star is 1.4' NW.


Two faint companions are nearby, the trio forming V Zw 146.  2MASX J01563383+3411435 = PGC 2045360 is 1.4' NW of center.  It appeared faint, round, 10" dia.  Easily visible due to a reasonably high surface brightness.  It is situated just 35" NNW of the mag 12 star to the NW of NGC 735.  PGC 7293 is 1.4' NE of NGC 735 and appeared extremely faint, round, 8" diameter. Only visible occasionally with averted.


17.5" (11/27/92): faint, small, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE.  The apparent elongation may be exaggerated due to a mag 14 star located at the NW edge 20" from center.  Several stars are nearby including a mag 10 star 1.5' SW and a mag 11.5 star 1.3' NW.  Located about 1° north of the NGC 750/751 group.


William Herschel discovered NGC 735 = H III-176 on 13 Sep 1784 (sweep 271) and logged "Stellar, the faintest imaginable, even 240 left some little doubt."  His position is 7' north of UGC 1411 = PGC 7282.  Perhaps due to his error in polar distance, Bigourdan was unable to recover the galaxy.  MCG (+06-05-058) doesn't label this galaxy as NGC 735.

13.1" (10/20/84): moderately bright, small, a faint star is at the north edge.  A nearly stellar galaxy (NGC 738:) is close NE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 736 = H II-221 = h169 on 12 Sep 1784 (sweep 268) and logged "F, pL, mE, r, 1 1/2' long."  JH observed this galaxy on 3 sweeps by and described it on 11 Nov 1827 as "pB; R; bM; has a *13m np".  Both Herschel's positions match UGC 1414 = PGC 7289.  John Herschel thought his father's description was irreconcileable ("much elongated" vs "R"), so they probably referred to different objects and he assigned separate designations in the General Catalogue.  Bindon Stoney sketched the group using the 72" on 11 Oct 1850 and NGC 736 is labeled Alpha.

17.5" (11/1/86): mag 15 star only located 30" N of NGC 736.


Bindon  Stoney discovered NGC 737 on the 11 Oct 1850 observation of the NGC 736 field and it was labeled "Beta" on the constructed diagram.  He measured a distance of 30" in PA 12° from NGC 736.  At this offset is a mag 15 star.  The 9 Jan 1874 observation notes "[h169 = NGC 736] has a 12m star 11.9°, 35.1" distant, this must be beta of Oct 11 1850, when it was recorded as a nebula.  [Sir J. Herschel records 3 observations of this companion object, all taken in Nov 1827.  Nov 11 has *13 np, Nov 16 has a "* near it" and lastly, Nov 22 "has a S* or stellar neb to the n."  In "Publications of Lick Observatory (Vol II), Sherburne Burnham identified NGC 737 as a mag 15.5 star about 30" N of NGC 736.  He accurately measured the offset from NGC 736 as PA = 10°, distance 32".  Curtis concluded "Does not exist; is simply a faint star" based on Crossley reflector plates at Lick and Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, also writes "*14.7 0.7' N of N736, no neb...".

Johnstone and Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 738 on 11 Oct 1850.  It was labeled "Gamma" on a field diagram.  An offset of 79" in PA 46° was measured from NGC 736, which matches CGCG 503-057 = PGC 7303.   CGCG 503-057 is mentioned in UGC notes to NGC 736 but is not identified as NGC 738.

Incorrect declination in the NGC (SW of NGC 750 instead of NW) and not identified as NGC 739 in the CGCG.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 739 on 9 Jan 1874 with the 72" at Birr Castle in an observation of NGC 750/751 group.  Described as "A cF, vS, R neb, bM (inside a triangle of st) is south-preceding the n[orth] component".  The direction should have read north-preceding the north component but Copeland gave the correct orientation as PA 292° (WNW) and separation 524" (8.7').  Because of his error the derived position was in error and this was copied into the NGC.  In 1913 Curtis noted there was nothing at the NGC position and suggested MCG +05-05-030 was NGC 739, based on Crossley photographs at Lick.  CGCG (503-059) fails to label its entry as NGC 739.

24" (12/21/16): at 375x; bright, moderately large, round, sharply concentrated with a small very bright core that increases to the center.  The halo increases with averted to over 1'.  A mag 11 star is 2.4' NW.  NGC 741 is the brightest in a group (WBL 061) with NGC 742 0.8' E of center, at the edge of the halo.  NGC 741 has a extended X-ray halo reaching a distance of 19' from its center.  Furthermore, twin radio jets emerge from the nucleus of NGC 742 and spread into a larger lobe that encircles NGC 741. A total of 8 members of the group were logged within 15' of NGC 741.


CGCG 413-006 (often misidentified as IC 1751) is 1.5' NW.  It appeared faint or fairly faint, very small, slightly elongated N-S, 0.3'x0.2', sharp stellar nucleus. The mag 11 star lies 1.4' W.

William Herschel discovered NGC 741 = H II-271 = h172, along with NGC 742, on 13 Dec 1784 (sweep 338).  His description from 25 Oct 1785 (sweep 464) reads "F.  I take it to be two very near each other.  240 stregthens the suspicision; not far from from the parallel [E-W]. The following [NGC 742] is the smallest, and most north, it is also the faintest."  R.J. Mitchell , the 72" observer on 24 Nov 1854, described a "D neb, the p one is pB, R, bM, the f one is smaller and fainter and lbM."


Lewis Swift found the galaxy on 26 Nov 1897 and reported in list XI-28, "pF; pS; R; 9m * near np."  His position is 6' too far northwest and Dreyer, assuming it was new, catalogued it again as IC 1751.  Herbert Howe corrected Swift's position though didn't make the connection with NGC 741.  The CGCG (413-006) labels the galaxy as IC 1751 instead of NGC 741.  See Corwin's notes.

On 10 Dec 1873, Ralph Copeland gave a more detailed description: "D neb, cB, pL, R, sbM and pF, S, R, sbM."  John Herschel's entry for GC 456 is confused; his description "nf h175 [NGC 750]" refers to NGC 761, but he used the same position as NGC 750 ("D neb"), so his comment could be interpreted as referring to NGC 751.  Perhaps to avoid confusion, Dreyer added the entry GC 5200 in the GC Supplement (with reference to the 1861 publication) for NGC 751 and used GC 456 for NGC 761 in the NGC.

Two equal mag companions to the south form an isosceles triangle.  There are no dense regions and the many brighter mag 9-10.5 stars are pretty evenly distributed throughout the field.  Many of the stars appear to be arrange in long strings and arcs, though.  There are perhaps 150 stars in the field (difficult to count) with a few nice pair and trios.  Off the SW side just out of the field is a wide bright pair of mag 5.7/5.9 stars at 3.6' (naked-eye).  The western of these two stars (56 Andromedae) has a striking orange-red hue and a faint companion.


8": very large, bright, many doubles, overfills low power field.  Easy naked-eye open cluster in dark sky.


Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 752 = H VII-32 = h174 on 29 Sep 1783, though this cluster is a naked-eye object.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, William found it a month earlier on 24 Aug, while observing with his 6.2-inch reflector.  On 21 Sep 1786 (sweep 599), he called it "a vL coarse scattered cluster of vL stars, irregularly round, very rich.  I suppose it takes up half a degree."   Later he noted "like a nebulous star to the naked eye."  But Italian astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna may have found the cluster earlier around 1654.

Ormond Stone independently found this galaxy in 1886 at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at Stone's position but 1 min of RA west and 5' south is NGC 755 and his size estimate (1.6'x0.4') and PA (65°) applies.  So, NGC 755 = NGC 763 with NGC 755 the primary designation.


Based on photographs taken in 1919-20 with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector at the Helwan Observatory, NGC 755 was described as "bright irregular central portion 1.25' long with no distinct nucleus, but showing some indications of spiral structure; the outer portions are vF and also show spiral strucutre."

A second low contrast arm begins at the south end of the core and spirals out clockwise to the east.  This arm is broader and does not have a sharply defined edge but was fairly easily visible.  The outer halo to the southeast of this arm has a very low surface brightness.  Forms an interacting pair with NGC 770 3.5' SSW.

As Safford's discovery was not published until the fall of 1887 as the NGC was going to press, Stephan is credited with the discovery in the GC Supplement (5205) and NGC.

This galaxy was observed 6 times at Birr Castle with the first observation on 4 Nov 1848 (possibly by Lord Rosse): "F, scarcely seen in finder, another S neb 60° np 1.5' dist, if it be not a F *."  A later observation noted "Either a single R neb with * inv sf center or double."  This galaxy is a disrupted spiral with a dust lane on the south side of the core, so some structure was resolved.

NGC 832

See observing notes for NGC 1226.  Here's the description of the double star suggested by Harold Corwin as a candidate for NGC 832:


17.5" (11/1/97): faint double star mag 14/15 at 7" separation.  Difficult to resolve cleanly at 220x in mediocre seeing due to faintness of the north-northeast component.  Easier to resolve at 280x.  Although the identification as NGC 832 is not certain, this close double star could easily be mistaken as a small nebulous object.  Located 4.3' NE of a mag 9.5-10 star. Also 2' SW is a wider, brighter pair of mag 13.5-14 stars at 11" separation, which is much easier to resolve.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 832 on 17 Sep 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and noted (single observation) that a mag 9-10 star was 5' southwest.  There is nothing at his position and no bright star is 5' southwest.  But Corwin suggests this number may apply to a close double star (7" separation) at 02 11 00.8 +35 32 29.  This pair is 24 seconds following d'Arrest's position (similar dec) and has a mag 9-10 star 4.3' southwest.  RNGC misidentifies PGC 8280 as NGC 832.  This extremely faint galaxy is 6.6' west of d'Arrest's position and is certainly too faint to have picked up.


In an email on 26 Jul 2016, Harold Corwin found that if d'Arrest made a 1-hour transcription error in RA his position is a good match (about 1' too far north) with NGC 1226.  Furthermore, there is a mag 10.4 star 4.3' SW, matching d'Arrest's description.  This identification seems likely as d'Arrest made several similar 1-hour errors in RA: NGC 3167 (= NGC 2789), NGC 3575 (= NGC 3162), and NGC 3760 (= NGC 3301).

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 859 = Sw. V-23 on 3 Oct 1886 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory and found again by Swift on 31 Oct 1886 and listed as V-22 = NGC 856.  Herbert Howe reported he was unable to find NGC 859 on a night he measured NGC 856.  That's not unexpected as there is only a single galaxy here and Swift's comment of "F* close" for NGC 856 applies to UGC 1713 = PGC 8526.  The two positions are close enough that it's surprising Swift didn't notice the equivalence, although his descriptions are quite different.  Since NGC 859 was discovered first, this designation should take historical precedence, although the galaxy is generally labeled as NGC 856.See Corwin's comments.

There is nothing at his position, but 30 seconds of RA west and 3' north is UGC 1727 = PGC 8586.  John Herschel called this object "vF; R; bM" and measured an accurate position (24 Nov 1827, sweep 108).


On 3 Oct 1856, Lewis Swift recorded 3 galaxies: Sw. V-23 = NGC 859, Sw. V-24 = NGC 866 and Sw. V-25 = NGC 868.  The second entry, which reads "pF; pS; R; lbM; sf of 2", also fits UGC 1727, though Swift's RA was 70 tsec too large (his dec is good).  Then on 31 Oct 1886, Swift revisited the area and recorded Sw.

48" (10/29/16): this striking two-armed barred spiral appeared bright, fairly large, overall elongated 3:2 SW-NE, well concentrated with a bright core.  The core extends into a weakly defined bar WNW-ESE.  A long thin spiral arm is attached to the west end of the bar and it curled gradually counter-clockwise to the south for nearly 90°, ending due south of the core [separation 1.2'].  A bright mag 10.7 star is superimposed on the east side [44" ESE of center].  The second spiral arm was not as easily seen as it begins just inside (west) of the bright star, which detracted from the view.  This thin arm extended straight north, roughly at a right angle to the bar and merged into the halo on the northeast side.  UGC 1775 = Arp 10 is 49' SE.

Overall the galaxy is fairly large with an irregular halo roughly SW-NE, ~2.5'x1.8'.  Contains a very bright, round nucleus and the brighter central region appeared extended WNW-ESE.  A spiral arm on the west and south side appeared as a slightly enhanced "wing", mostly seen as an enhanced curving edge.  The opposing arm was only a short and weak arc enhancement that extended north of the bright star.

Lewis Swift found NGC 866 = Sw. V-24 on 3 Oct 1886 and again on 31 Oct 1886 (NGC 885 = Sw. V-27) with the 16" refractor at the Warner Observatory.  There is nothing at his position, and Herbert Howe reported he could not find NGC 866 in 1899-00.  Swift's discovery positions for NGC 866 and 885 are similar in declination but differ by 4 minutes in RA.


In the case of NGC 866, Swift's RA was 1 min of RA east of NGC 863 = UGC 1727, and NGC 885 is 5 min of RA east of NGC 863.  William Herschel (III-260) discovered this galaxy 100 years earlier and it was catalogued as NGC 863.  So, NGC 863 = NGC 866 = NGC 885.  There are several cases where Swift recorded two observations of the same galaxy in two different lists, including Sw. V-23 = NGC 859 (3 Oct 1886) and Sw.

William Herschel discovered NGC 867 = H III-2 on 21 Dec 1783 (the only nebula in his early sweep #61).  His complete description reads "An almost invisible F neb, it is R and about 8 or 10" diameter, being brighter in the centre than outwards.  It can be seen when the glass if perfectly clean and the attention confined to the object.  By two diagrams it is about 1.5° nf a star which was taken to be 69 Ceti, but obs was interrupted by clouds."  There is nothing at Herschel's rough position and Bigourdan was unable to find H III-2 on two attempts.  Heinrich d'Arrest suggested NGC 867 might be a duplicate of NGC 875 and Dreyer noted this in the NGC entry for 875, although Herschel's position is a poor match.  Corwin also suggests IC 225 as another possibility.  See his identification notes for more.

Close following the mag 6.6 star is a neat parabolic group of five stars opening towards the star.  On the west side of this star is a rich group of ~20 stars mostly arranged in an incomplete ring.  A faint curving string of stars from the mag 6.7 star leads to the parabolic quintet.  The 20' field at 220x has too many stars to count, but probably has ~200 stars.

This is probably the reason RNGC misclassifies NGC 874 as nonexistent and MCG does not label MCG -04-06-019 as NGC 874.  See Corwin's NGC identifications for more on this number.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 875 = Sw. V-26 on 26 Sep 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  Lewis Swift independently found it again on 7 Oct 1886 and recorded "eF; vS; R."  Both of their positions match UGC 1760 = PGC 8718.  William Herschel may have originally discovered this galaxy and catalogued it as H III-2 = NGC 867 (the identity was suggested by d'Arrest), but this identification is uncertain due to a poor position.

17.5" (10/25/97): the following group of the remarkable field of the "double cluster" is not as large or bright as NGC 869, but is centered around two wide triple stars.  The central 5' has up to 50 stars including a number of faint mag 14-15 stars forming a rich background.  Off the west end of the central region is a long string of stars which heads NE for 10' towards 3 brighter stars and then turning south and heading back past mag 8 orange-red RS Persei. The 20' field includes ~200 stars, although the cluster includes fewer bright stars as NGC 869 and is less compressed.


8": this is the eastern component of the "double cluster".  Very bright, large, very rich, ~20' diameter, ~60 stars, includes bright colored stars, many doubles.


Hipparchus catalogued the Double Cluster about 130 BC and Ptolemy copied it into his Almagest: "At the tip of the right hand [of Perseus] and nebulous [or misty]."  Giovanni Battista Hodierna (1654) resolved the double cluster into stars.  William Herschel logged NGC 884 = H VI-34 on 1 Nov 1788 (sweep 877) as "A very beautiful, brilliant cluster of large stars irregularly round, very rich, near one-half degree in diameter."  John Herschel noted on 9 Dec 1831 (sweep 387) that "a fine ruby star in the centre".  The cluster was examined at Birr Castle looking for colored stars and five red stars were reported and one with a bluish tinge.

48" (10/25/11): at 375x, the stunning edge-on NGC 891 was one of the top highlights of the observing week with the 48".  The galaxy nearly filled the 16' field, stretching nearly 12' by 2' SSW-NNE.  A 17th magnitude star is superimposed close to the NNE tip and a mag 16.5 star is near the SSW end.  The brighter, bulging central region extends 2.5' with a mag 12 star just north of the core on the west side.  A similar star is superimposed on the southern extension along with a few fainter stars.  A very high contrast dust lane slices through most of the galaxy except at the tips, where the galaxy fades out.  I was surprised how broad the dust lane appeared, particularly through the central section.  Although the dust lane perfectly bisects the galaxy into two symmetric halves, the edge of the lane was ragged and uneven.


MAC 0222+4222 = ZOAG G140.39-17.38 was visible just off the east edge, 2.3' NNE of center and collinear with two mag 12 and 13.3 stars off the west edge of the galaxy.  It appeared as a very faint, elongated glow, ~15"x6".  Once identified I could hold this galaxy nearly continuously with averted vision.  In addition, an extremely compact anonymous galaxy is just 50" NW the center of NGC 891 and 40" SE of the mag 13.3 star.  It was visible continuously at 375x and 488x as a faint glow, roughly 6" diameter.  Surprisingly this object is not listed in NED, HyperLeda or SIMBAD, though it's probably no fainter than mag 16.5.

William Herschel discovered NGC 891 = H V-19 = h218 on 6 Oct 1783 and described "a considerably bright nebula about 15' long and 3' broad; its length is divided in the middle by a black division at least 3' or 4' long."  On 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614), he logged "cB, about 15' long and 2 or 3' broad, bM, nearly in the meridian, a little from sp to nf."  On 24 Oct 1786 (sweep 621), he swept it again as "cB, gbM, about 15' l and 3' br, a black division in the middle in the direction of the length; at least 3 or 4' long." In the notes section of his first catalogue, William mentioned that Caroline found this object on 27 Aug 1783 in his first catalogue, but this is a transcription error in the handwritten copy sent to the printer as she found NGC 205 = M110 on that date (sketched earlier by Messier).  Admiral William Smyth repeated this error in his Cycle of Celestial Objects (1844).  WH also found two members of nearby Abell Galaxy Cluster 347 (NGC 898 and 910) on 17 Oct 1786.  He published a sketch in his 1811 paper (Fig. 12) as an illustration of "nebulae that are remarkable for some particularity in figure or brightness."


John Herschel noted on sweep 182 that it "has a chink or dark division in the middle and two stars."  He sketched the galaxy and remarked "An extraordinary object. Perhaps the figure is too nicely symmetrical as it certainly is too sharply defined.  It is of the last degree of faintness and may very well be though full in the field of view. There can hardly be a doubt a thin flat ring of enormous dimensions seen very obliquely."  The galaxy was also sketched at Birr Castle in 1850-51 and Dreyer noted, "I think the split is broader at one end, and that the nebula is a little more sharply defined on the following [Eastern] branch.  The central part is longer, but perhaps not so bright as on the preceding branch.  A bifurcation suspected at south end by Lord Rosse."

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 894 on 28 Nov 1856 using Lord Rosse's 72" and described a "D neb, components unite a preceding end.  The south one [NGC 895] is L, oval gbM, the n one [NGC 894] is more elongated and fainter, also bM."  But the observation by J.L.E. Dreyer on 14 Oct 1876 revealed a single spiral with GC 530 = NGC 894 the brightest portion of a spiral arm: "pF, L, seemed first to have 2 Nuclei preceding-following, the foll one being the brighter, but it was soon seen that the preceding one is no Nucl, but only the brightest part of a curved arm, convex sp, very soft.  Sometimes I thought there was also some condensed part f the Nucl; Lord Rosse thought there was some patch or neby s of the nucleus [this probably refers to the southeastern spiral arm].  So, NGC 894 is the brightest part of the northwestern spiral arm of NGC 895.  This was recognized by Curtis after being photographed with the Crossley reflector at Lick Observatory (see 1918 Lick publication).

To the west of the mag 10 star is a  dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, moderately high surface brightness patch (NGC 896) of 2' diameter.  To the east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and following this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length.  It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has a small, brighter patch.  Initially, I thought the complex ended here on the NE side, but then additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west for several arc minutes increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.


17.5" (11/27/92): at 100x with OIII filter this is a fairly bright emission nebula, very large, about 20' diameter.  Elongated roughly E-W but consists of two distinct sections (NGC 896 and IC 1795) which merge together.  The bright western portion = NGC 896 has a high surface brightness, round, ~7' diameter and a star is off the NW edge.  A weak dark lane separates NGC 896 from faint IC 1795.  The region is weakly nebulous without filter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 896 = H III-695 on 3 Nov 1787 (sweep 774) and recorded "eF, pL, iF.  Mem. The PD must be reckoned inaccurate, the string having been touched since the last cluster was taken."


NGC 896 is generally taken as the brightest portion of the IC 1795 complex on the southwest end (IC 1795/NGC 895 being the northwest portion of the huge "Heart Nebula").  JH did not make an observation to confirm the position.  Corwin suggests that IC 1795 (found by Barnard) is a separate knot in the same HII complex, though Wolfgang Steinicke equates NGC 896 with IC 1795.

48" (10/27/19): at 375x; Showpiece two-armed spiral extending 5'x2' WSW-ESE and displaying a great deal of structure.  Contains a bright oval core with a very small, very bright nucleus. A knotty spiral arm is rooted at the northeast end of the core. It bends sharply to the west on the north side of the core and displays a blotchy surface. As this arm extended west it separated from an inner arm by a dark lane, spread out and faded at the west end.


A longer spiral arm emerges from the west side of the core.  It wraps tightly to the east in a bright arc to the south of the core.  This arm has a fairly well defined outer edge, but was not as splotchy as the northern arm.  At the east end, it splits into two arms with a slightly darker gap between and passes north of a mag 14.4 star.

Several mag 13/14 stars in a curving chain are just south.  This galaxy is identified as UGC 1890 in most sources.  See Corwin's comments.


17.5" (8/5/97): fairly faint, moderately large, elongated SW-NE, 1.5'x0.8', broad concentration with large slightly brighter core.  Located close north of a semi-circular group of stars and just 2.0' NNW of mag 8.2 SAO 55553.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 917 is uncertain and this number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 917 = h220 on 22 Nov 1827 and recorded "vF, S, R, forms a semicircle with 4 st."  There is nothing at Herschel's single position.  Dreyer looked for h220 on 5 Nov 1874 at Birr Castle and noted "no nebulosity seen, only 3 st about 18-20 mag close together nearly in a line pf" (these stars are visible on the DSS).  In the NGC notes, Dreyer adds: "h220.  No neb, only a vs, Cl with 4 st nr np (2 Birr obs, 1874-76, not found by d'Arrest)."  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


Harold Corwin identifies NGC 917 = UGC 1890.  This galaxy is situated exactly 20' S of Herschel's position and there are several stars just south that form a slightly curving arc.  Corwin also checked the sweep and found a diagram matching the nearby stars and nebula (UGC 1890) nearly perfectly.  So, JH must have made a clerical error in recording or transfering the position or simply misread the NPD on his telescope. Archinal and Hynes (Star Clusters) misidentify an asterism near JH's original position as NGC 917.  See Corwin's notes.

17.5" (8/5/97): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, broad concentration to a brighter core.  A mag 14 star is at the west edge .  Viewed after glimpsing UGC 1920 (the galaxy taken to be NGC 920), which is 9.5' W.


UGC 1920 (listed as NGC 920 in all modern sources) appeared extremely faint, moderately large, ~1.5' diameter, very low surface brightness, required averted vision to glimpse.  This roundish unconcentrated glow is situated within a group of stars including a mag 11 star 1.6' WSW and mag 13 stars 1' NW and 1' SE.  I would not have noticed this object without averted vision and knowing the exact location using a printed finder chart.  Located 9.5' W of much brighter NGC 920 = IC 1799 and 15' WNW of NGC 933.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 920 = Sw. II-20, along with NGC 933,  on 11 Sep 1885 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  His description reads "eF, eS, R; 1 or 2 eF * close; e diff." and his position is 16 sec of RA west and 1.5' north of UGC 1920 = PGC 9377, the galaxy which has always been taken as NGC 920.  I wrote the following note in Jan 2014 to Harold Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke after I realized that NGC 920 probably refers to IC 1799, a brighter galaxy 10' ENE:


"Swift's position in list II-20 is also 70 tsec due west of IC 1799 = UGC 1943, and an excellent match in declination (given Swift's general accuracy). So, IC 1799 is only off in RA from Swift's position. His description mentions "1 or 2 eF* nr", which could apply to either galaxy, but UGC 1920 also has brighter nearby stars that to me would be mentioned.  More importantly, though, IC 1799 is a more prominent galaxy than UGC 1920. In fact I probably would have missed UGC 1920 (the halo is very low surface brightness) in my 18-inch if I wasn't looking in the right place. IC 1799, on the other hand, was immediately noticed in the field, and has a much higher surface brightness. So, I'm suggesting NGC 920 = IC 1799 = UGC 1943."


Wolfgang Steinicke responded that his copy of Swift's paper came from Max Wolf's library in Heidelberg and "The '0' (of 20) is struck through and a '1' is noted to the right of the digit." Therefore Wolf also suspected a 1 minute error in Swift's RA.  Corwin notes that once 1 tmin of RA is added to Swift's RA, this leaves only a "difference in RA of only -10 seconds in RA and just -7 arcseconds in Dec -- negligible, in the face of Swift's usual errors."


Guillaume Bigourdan independently discovered this galaxy on 28 Jan 1891, measured an accurate position, and it was catalogued as Big. 251 (later IC 1799).  All major catalogues, as well as NED, HyperLeda and SIMBAD, identify this galaxy as IC 1799.  This leaves UGC 1920, the galaxy always assumed to be NGC 920, without a NGC or IC designation.

In March of 2020, Yann Pothier suggested the original discovery was made by Dreyer on 6 Nov 1874, though he assumed his observation applied to H. III-570 = NGC 898.  His description, which reads "pB (at least not vF), S, lE npp sff.  A * in Pos. 27.3°, Dist. 145.5".", does not apply to NGC 898, but NGC 923 instead, which is located 4.2 minutes of time east of NGC 898.


Wolfgang Steinicke added the following comments: "The reason why Dreyer missed III 570 (NGC 898) on 6 Nov. 1874 is not due to an incorrect setting of the 72-inch. This is shown by correct data given for the other objects in that night (all observed before GC 533 [NGC 898]): GC 5036 (NGC 7794), GC 82 (NGC 169+IC 1559) and GC 272/78/89 (NGC 483/95/99). Dreyer simply had no coordinates. The main source of the Birr Castle astronomers were JH's catalogues (h, GC). Unfortunately, JH could not find III 570 (and III 571 = NGC 910) in his sweeps, though both objects were in his working lists, prepared by CH from her zone catalogue. Thus young Dreyer could only use WH's 2nd catalogue, giving relative positions to Beta Persei. Happy to see a "lE" nebula (at the place of NGC 923), he took the first choice: III 570 (NGC 898), though not at WH's place. For Dreyer derived no position for himself, he used WH's in his catalogues [and therefore later entered Stephan's observation to the NGC as a new object]."

24" (1/25/14): on this observation I used 375x and focused on the HII regions in the spiral arms of NGC 925.  [HK83] 120/121 was seen as an extremely faint, very small HII knot on the west end of NGC 925, 3.2' from center. This HII complex is near the western tip of the southern spiral arm, though I couldn't trace the arm itself as far this knot but a mag 14 star was identified 0.9' SSE.


[HK83] 44, a very faint 6" knot, was barely detached off the east end of the central bar.  A second fainter and even smaller knot, [HK83] 46/49, was occasionally seen ~20" WNW, right at the tip of the bar. [HK83] 42, a faint 6" knot, was seen along the weak southern arm, 1.5' SE of center.  The location was pinpointed just north of the midpoint of two mag 13.5/14.5 stars oriented E-W at 1.6' separation.


17.5" (11/26/94): fairly bright, large, about 5' diameter although the halo is irregular.  The core appears as a bright bar running through the center and elongated WNW-ESE with a fainter halo north and south of the bar. The bar is moderately concentrated and has a mottled texture.  There is a strong impression of very faint extensions or arms that begin to hook north on the WNW end and south on the ESE ends of the bar.  An extremely faint knot is just visible off the west side 3.3' from the center. This knot is an HII complex and association near the edge of a spiral arm and is catalogued as #120 in Hodge-Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  Several stars are near; a mag 10.5 star lies 3.4' S of center, two mag 12 stars are just north of the core 1.0' and 1.5' from the center and a wide pair of mag 12.5 star are 5' W.

= Not found, Gottlieb and Corwin.


Ralph Copeland, an observing assistant at Birr Castle, discovered NGC 930 on 26 October 1872 with the 72". While observing NGC 932 (GC 543) he noted a second object close nearby, which he described as "F, S, iR, vgbM" and offset from NGC 930 by 60" in PA 314.3 deg (NW) or 3.1" p and 42" N.  This nova was not mentioned in the subsequent three observations of NGC 930 in 1872, 1873 and 1876 but Dreyer added it to the GC Supplement (5238), repeating Copeland's description.


I carefully examined the POSS print of the field and the only object near the offset is a mag 12.4 star (GSC 1221-478).  There is a small reddish condensation with dimensions about 10" diameter at the northeast edge of the galaxy and Karl Reinmuth took this as NGC 930 ("eF, vS, R, vgvvlbM; 0.6' nf att NGC 932.").  But neither the separation nor the direction is a good match. So, NGC 930 is nonexistent.


The RNGC mixes up the identifications and lists the main galaxy as NGC 930 and calls NGC 932 non-existent.  Since Herschel was definitely the first to observe this galaxy, H II-489 = GC 543 = NGC 932 should apply and the data listed in the RNGC under NGC 930 should be transferred to NGC 932.  UGC and CGCG equate the numbers NGC 930 = NGC 932, but the galaxy should be identified as NGC 932 only, since Copeland was clearly referring to something different.   Listed in RNGC Corrections #4.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 934 = T I-10 in 1876 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and described as "very small and faint.  5" dia = tiny planetary nebula".  His position matches UGC 1926 = PGC 9352.


Based on a photograph taken by Perrine with the Crossley reflector, Heber Curtis noted "A small, faint, nearly round nebula is near this place, but it is not a planetary."  In 1915, Harold Knox-Shaw also noted it was not a planetary based on a visual observation at the Helwan Observatory south of Cairo.

Édouard Stephan found NGC 952 = St III-6 on 14 December 1871 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  There is nothing at Stephan's usually accurate position and Corwin initially concluded that Stephan must have misidentified his offset star (given as 4713 Lalande).  Bigourdan was unable to recover the object and Corwin was also unsuccessful in using offsets from different nearby comparison stars.


But Emmanuel Esmiol, an assistant at Marseille Observatory, lists a different offset star (HD 15866) in his 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions.  The corrected position matches NGC 940, discovered by d'Arrest in 1865.  In fact, Esmiol calls this object NGC 940, instead of NGC 952 in his table.  In any case, NGC 952 = NGC 940.

In the NGC notes, Dreyer mentioned this object was a possible "variable nebula" because it was easily seen by Schönfeld in 1863, 1864 and 1868, Friedrich August Winnecke and Heinrich d'Arrest, but was not found by Vogel in 1865 nor Schönfeld in 1861.  Sherburne Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) observed and measured the object without difficulty.  Winnecke wrote a paper in 1878 that claimed NGC 955 showed a "periodic variability".  It was also compared for variability on plates taken with the 60" at Mt Wilson in 1913 and 1917 and at the Helwan Observatory around 1920.  Wolfgang Steinicke covers the story in his book on the NGC (p519).

17.5" (11/26/94): 15 stars mag 12-14 and two mag 9 stars in a 5'x2' group, very elongated N-S.  The two mag 9 stars bracket the group at the north (mag 8.9 SAO 38098) and south ends.  Not rich but stands out reasonably well at low power as the stars form a rough curving "S" asterism.  Two additional mag 9/10 stars are 3' and 5' W of SAO 38098 but do not appear part of the cluster.  The classification of this group as a true cluster is doubtful.

48" (10/26/11): at 488x this galaxy is sharply concentrated with a very intense oval core oriented WSW-ENE, ~36"x27", The core increases to a bright quasi-stellar nucleus and sometimes a stellar point.  The core is surrounded by a much fainter outer halo, 1.6'x1.3', that is only slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  PGC 175239 was picked up 5' NNE.


17.5" (12/4/93): faint, small, round, weak concentration, occasional stellar nucleus.  Just NW are three equally spaced stars mag 11 and 12 which form a line NW-SE of length 6'.  Located 7.7' SSE of mag 8.9 SAO 148452.  NGC 981 lies 13' SSW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 977 = H III-472 = h2485 on 28 Nov 1785 (sweep 479) and recorded "vF, pL, vlbM, near some scattered stars.".  Both William and John Herschel measured accurate positions.

William Herschel discovered NGC 982 = H III-573 = h236, along with NGC 980 = H III-572, on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) describing them together as "Two.  Both vF, vS, er, dist 4', the place between them.  As WH did not provide individual positions, Dreyer used John Herschel's positions for h235 and h236.  Unfortunately, JH measured the position of h236 accurately, but reversed the sign of the declination offset to NGC 982, placing it 5.5' too far south.  This resulted in h235 (later GC 565) being placed southwest of h236 (later GC 566).  Dreyer copied the GC positions into the NGC, and noted the orientation as SW-NE, instead of NW-SE as they appear on the sky.


Because of this error, RNGC, CGCG, UGC and RC3 reverse the identifications of NGC 980 and 982, which should be NGC 980 = UGC 2063 = PGC 9831 and NGC 982 = UGC 2066 = PGC 9838.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 983 = St III-11 on 13 Dec 1871 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  His 6th magnitude reference star was misidentified, so the position in list III is incorrect. The error was caught and mentioned in a footnote in MN XXXII, although there was still a typo of 10 tmin in RA in the corrected position.  Using Stephan's offsets (3 tmin 8 tsec and 3' 38") from 15 Triangulum, his position corresponds with UGC 2133 = PGC 10034.  Stephan found the galaxy again 10 years later on 14 Dec 1881, measured an accurate position in List XII-21, and Dreyer catalogued it as NGC 1002.  Karl Reinmuth missed the footnote in MN and in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, couldn't find NGC 983.  In any case, NGC 983 = NGC 1002.  Although NGC 983 should be the primary designation due to the earlier discovery, the galaxy is usually identified as NGC 1002.  RNGC misclassifies NGC 983 as nonexistent.  See Corwin's notes

48" (10/26/11): at 488x and 610x this disrupted galaxy (possible collisional ring) revealed its structure.  A very bright, sharp stellar nucleus is offset to the southwest side of the halo.  The moderately large halo appears as a 0.9'x0.7' oval or a circle that was squashed along the south and southeast edge, near the nucleus.  With averted vision, the brighter rim was noticeable and the galaxy appeared as a ring with a darker center and a "diamond" (the Seyfert nucleus) attached on the southeast side.  The ring appeared similar to a faint annular planetary.  An extremely faint mag 18 star is at the north edge of the rim.


2MASX J02343785-0853042, an easily visible galaxy, lies 6' S.  It appeared faint to fairly faint, slightly elongated NW-SE, 20"x15", broad concentration, brighter core.  A mag 12.5 star lies 45" NW.


17.5" (10/29/94): fairly faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, sharp stellar nucleus with a small very faint halo!  A triangle of mag 10/11 stars with sides 1.7', 2.5' and 3.0' is about 5' WNW and the galaxy forms the bottom of a "cross" asterism with these stars.  This is a Seyfert galaxy, accounting for the dominant nucleus.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 986 = D 519 = h2487 on 5 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta (near Sydney) and described "a faint nebula, of an irregular round figure, about 30" diameter, north of a bright small star."  His position is 9' SE of NGC 986 (typical error) and there are no other nearby brighter galaxies that he might have been picked up instead.


John Herschel described the galaxy on 23 Oct 1835 as "pB, L, psbM, 3' long 2' broad, either binuclear or more elongated on the n.f. side than on the opposite."  On a later sweep he logged "B, L, pmE, very suddenly much brighter middle, 100" long 60" broad, unequally bright, and exhibiting an approach to binuclear form."  See Plate VI, figure 14 of the CGH Observations.  Herschel's secondary nucleus appears to be the brighter southwest end of the central bar.


Joseph Turner sketched the galaxy on 29 Nov 1875 with the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.  He resolved it as a stretched S-shaped barred spiral. See Plate I, figure 8 "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885".  Albert Le Sueur earlier made a sketch (plate VII, figure 80) that was not published.

This galaxy is the brightest, along with NGC 995 7.2' SSW, of a group of 8 galaxies (6 NGC's) generally arranged in a ring (part of the NGC 1023 group).  Forms a close pair with NGC 999 2' NE and also forms the southern vertex of an isosceles triangle with two mag 10.5-11 stars 3' NE and 3' NW.


17.5" (11/1/86): faint, small, round, small bright core.  Forms a pair with NGC 999 2' NE in the NGC 995-1005 group.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 996 = St III-13 (along with NGC 995 = St III-12 and NGC 1001 = St III-16) on 7 Dec 1871 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  His position matches UGC 2123 = PGC 10015.  Second in a group of 6 NGC galaxies discovered by Stephan.

24" (12/28/16): at 375x; moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30" diameter, small bright core, stellar nucleus, high surface brightness.  Mag 9.5 HD 16303 is 1.4' SW.  Forms a pair with NGC 998 1.8' NNE.  Brightest in a group (redshift-based distance ~250 million l.y.) with CGCG 414-028 8' N and UGC 2092, an extreme superthin, lies 10.6' W.


CGCG 414-028 appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.  I was surprised the visibility is comparable to NGC 998.

UGC 2092: extremely faint, fairly small, elongated ~5:2 SW-NE, ~20"x8", very low surface brightness!  As the axial ratio of this bulgeless superthin is ~12:1, I only picked up the slightly brighter central section.


17.5" (10/8/94): faint, small, round, 40" diameter, weak concentration, small ill-defined core.  Located 1.4' NE of mag 9 SAO 110644!  Forms a close pair with NGC 998 1.8' NNE.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 997 = m 64 (along with NGC 998) on 10 Nov 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and noted "F, S".  His position matches UGC 2102 = PGC 9932.  Brightest in a group of faint galaxies -- one of which (NGC 997 NED01) is in the halo on the north side.

24" (12/28/16): at 375x; very faint to faint, small, round, 18" diameter, very low surface brightness.  Forms a close pair with NGC 997 1.8' SSW.


17.5" (10/8/94): extremely faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  Very low even surface brightness and requires averted vision.  Forms a close pair with brighter NGC 997 1.8' SSW.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 998 = m 65 (along with NGC 997) on 10 Nov 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and simply noted "vF".  NGC 998 was placed 2 sec of RA following and 1' N of NGC 997, and at this position is PGC 9934.


CGCG misidentifies NGC 997 with CGCG 414-028 = PGC 2802440, a small, very faint galaxy situated 8.2' NNE of NGC 997.  The UGC notes to NGC 997 and the RNGC follow the CGCG error and also misidentify CGCG 414-028 as NGC 998.  NGC 998 is mentioned as an anonymous companion to NGC 997 in the UGC notes.  PGC has the correct identification, though is incorrect to use CGCG 414-028 as an alias.  MCG reverses the identifications as well as the declinations.  The identification of NGC 997 is included in my RNGC Corrections #7.

18" (12/18/06): faint, small, round, 25" diameter, weak concentration.  Sandwiched between a mag 11 star 1' NE and a mag 14 star just off the SW edge [28" from the center].  Located just 2' NE of NGC 996 in the NGC 995-1005 group with NGC 1001 4.5' E.


17.5" (11/1/86): very faint, very small, round.  A mag 12 star is 1.0' NE.  Member of the NGC 995-1005 group with NGC 1001 4.7' E.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 999 = St III-14 (along with NGC 995 = St III-12 and NGC 1001 = St III-16) on 8 Dec 1871 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  His position matches UGC 2127 = PGC 10026.  CGCG, UGC, PGC and HyperLEDA equate NGC 999 = St IC 240, but Bigourdan measured IC 240 with respect to NGC 999 so they cannot be equivalent.  Malcolm Thomson noted this error in his survey of IC identifications and Harold Corwin suggests IC 240 is probably a line of 4 faint stars.  NGC 999 is the third in a group of 6 NGC galaxies discovered by Stephan over 3 nights.
