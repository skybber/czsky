?douard Stephan found NGC 1002 = St XII-21 on 14 Dec 1881 with the 31" reflector at the Marseille Observatory.  His position matches UGC 2133 = PGC 10034, though he discovered (list III-11) this galaxy 10 years earlier on 13 Dec 1871 and Dreyer catalogued it as NGC 983.  Stephan misidentified his comparison star, though, so the position for NGC 983 is incorrect.  When corrected, NGC 983 = NGC 1002.  Because the position for NGC 1002 is unambiguous, catalogues use this identification.  See Corwin's notes for NGC 983.

48" (10/25/11): this gorgeous galaxy appeared extremely bright, very elongated 4:1 E-W, ~7'x1.8', with a large, brighter central core that increases to an intensely bright inner core punctuated by a bright stellar nucleus.  The outer halo gradually fades at the ends of the extensions.  Several stars are superimposed on both sides of the core.


NGC 1023A = PGC 10139, a low surface brightness dwarf companion, is superimposed on the east side (2.4' ESE of center).  It appeared as a faint, fairly large, low surface brightness patch oriented SSW-NNE, roughly 1.2'x0.8', and it blends into the main galaxy.  Although most of the companion is within the halo of NGC 1023, part of it juts out the southeast edge of the galaxy.  The halo of NGC 1023 extends beyond (east) of the dwarf.


18" (8/1/05): at 225x, this striking galaxy appeared very bright, large, very elongated 4:1 E-W, ~4.5'x1.0', though can possibly be traced further with averted vision.  The central region has a dramatic, sharp concentration with an unusually bright, oval core.  Two mag 14 and 15 stars are superimposed off the west side of the core and a mag 14 star is off the east side.


17.5" (12/8/90): bright, large, very elongated 7:2 E-W, very bright core, almost stellar nucleus.  A large fainter halo increases the dimensions to 7'x2'.  Two 15th magnitude stars are superimposed on the east and west ends.


13.1" (12/22/84): very bright, impressive, elongated ~E-W, bright core, stellar nucleus.


8" (11/8/80): fairly bright, bulging bright core, lens-shaped.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1023 = H I-156 = h242 on 18 Oct 1786 (sweep 618) and noted "eB, mE, a very BN, the branches losing themselves in the direction of the parallel nearly."  On 17 Jan 1787 (sweep 692), he recorded "vB, gmbM to a very bright nucleus, mE nearly 10' long, from about 12? sp to nf." John Herschel sketched the galaxy in Oct 1828 and as well as Bindon Stoney on 27 Dec 1850 (included in plate XXV in Lord Rosse's 1861 publication).

A number of the stars are arranged in spiraling rays emanating from the dominant star.  The cluster is composed of a mixture of bright and faint stars.


8": includes a dozen stars mag 8 to 12.5.  Fairly small, rich, over unresolved background haze.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1027 = H VIII-66 on 3 Nov 1787 (sweep 774) and described "a cluster of coarsely scattered considerably large stars, 8' or 10' diameter, one 7th mag, near the middle."  On 9 Nov 1787 (sweep 777) he logged "a much scattered cluster of cL stars.  A star 7m not far from the middle, about 15' diam."


Corwin comments that E.E. Barnard independently found the object (probably on a plate), sent a note directly to Dreyer and it was catalogued again as IC 1824.  Barnard's position is at the west edge of the cluster and his description reads "Cl, sts F, perh[aps] F neby p extends to it."  So, NGC 1027 = IC 1824.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1037 = Sw. V-35 on 29 Sep 1886 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory and wrote "eeeF; vS; vE; eee dif; [NGC 1032] in field".  There is nothing near his position and furthermore NGC 1032 is ~3? away from his coordinates.  But no reasonably bright galaxy is in the field of NGC 1032 either. Perhaps he misidentified NGC 1032?  RNGC, PGC, and RC3 misidentify UGC 2119 = PGC 9973 as NGC 1032.  This galaxy is 2 tmin of RA west and 7' S of Swift's position and still doesn't agree with Swift's comment about NGC 1032.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1038 = Sw. III-16 = Sw. V-34 on 17 Oct 1885 with the 16-inch refractor at the Warner Observatory and "discovered" it again on 2 Oct 1886, recording it in his 5th discovery list.  Dreyer combined both entries in the NGC.  Swift's position is accurate.


William Herschel made an observation on 1 Jan 1786 (sweep 505) and noted "suspected, may be 2 small close stars in the parallel."  Apparently he never confirmed the observation so it was not catalogued.  His position (Caroline's reduction) is less that 1' northwest of UGC 2158, so he clearly "suspected" NGC 1038.

24" (12/28/13): gorgeous low power field with 21mm Ethos (125x; 49' diameter).  The cluster roughly extends 35' with a much richer and brighter core of ~12'-15' that contains a large number of mag 8-10 stars.  Several of the brighter stars appear as wide doubles or in chains.  A long string of stars is on the south side of the core, extending towards the southeast.  Other chains extend north and east out of the core.  Several doubles were identified using the chart in Stoyan's "Atlas of the Messier Objects".  O? 44 is a challenging mag 8.5/9.0 pair at 1.4" that just resolved at 225x and better at 300x.  Another 8th mag star (C component) is widely separated at 86".  h2154 is a 9.5/10.9 pair at 10" on the SW side and h1123 is a very wide 20" pair of mag 8.4 star.  Also in the core is ES 1506, a challenging mag 8.9/14 pair at 7" and h2155, a very wide 8.3/10.3 pair at 17" on the NE side.  PN Abell 4 lies 38' ESE of center.

Giovanni Hodierna probably discovered M34 = NGC 1039 = h248 around 1654, though there is some doubt on his intended object. Charles Messier found M34 again on 25 Aug 1764, and is generally credited with the discovery. William Herschel described M34 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) as "a cl of scattered L stars, considerably rich."  John Herschel called it a "fine cluster, about 20 st 9 10...11m and as many less.

48" (10/26/16): at 488x; bright, very large, face-on spiral with a small bright core and a relatively small weak bar oriented ~NW-SE.  Low contrast spiral structure was visible around the core.  Most prominent, though, was an outer spiral arm along the east side, which swept N-S in a gentle arc.  It was brightest just to the west of a mag 13.6 star [SDSS reveals numerous HII knots] situated 1.6' SE of the core.  The outer spiral arm along the western edge was more diffuse and ill-defined, passing just east of a 16th magnitude star 1.7' WSW of the core.


17.5" (11/1/86): very large, very diffuse low surface brightness system best viewed at 83x or 133x.  Almost round, slightly brighter on the SE end with either a very faint star(s) superimposed or a brighter knot.  Forms a pair with NGC 1048 (double system) 6' SSE and NGC 1052 lies 14' NE.


13.1" (9/3/86): very large but diffuse, only a very weak concentration.


13.1" (9/9/83): large, very diffuse, no central brightening, irregularly round, best at 62x (too large and diffuse for higher power).


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1042 = Sw. III-17 on 10 Nov 1885 with the 16" Clark refractor at Warner Observatory and reported "eeF, L, R, np of 2 [with NGC 1052]".  In his 5th discovery list, Swift corrected the description to read "sp of 2" [with NGC 1052].  Based on a photograph taken with the Reynolds reflector at the Helwan observatory in the late 1920s, NGC 1042 was described as an "open spiral with a pF stellar Ncl, well defined [arms] with some [knots]."

24" (1/31/14): NGC 1044 is a double system with fainter LEDA 3080165 barely off the SE side.  At 375x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, 24"x20", gradually increases to a sub-stellar nucleus.  PGC 3080165 is attached at the SE side [19" between centers].  The companion was faint, extremely small, round, 8" diameter.  This pair is flanked by CGCG 414-36 1.0' NE (noted as "faint, very small, round, 10" diameter") and NGC 1046 2.0' SE, with the collinear quartet spanning 3.0'.  The four galaxies have identical redshifts, though there is no sign of interaction on the DSS.


17.5" (10/29/94): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 WNW-ESE, broad concentration to a large brighter core.  A mag 11 star lies 2.3' NW.  Brightest of a collinear compact trio with NGC 1046 2.0' SE and MCG +01-07-022 = CGCG 414-036 off the NW edge 57" from the center (logged as "very faint, extremely small, round"). NGC 1044 appears larger than the listed dimensions probably due to the combined glow with an unresolved contact companion (PGC 3080165) at the SE edge.  The four galaxies are very nearly on a straight line.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1044 = III-228 = h251, along with NGC 1046, on 7 Nov 1784 (sweep 308) and noted "eF, vS, 240 power confirmed it.  Another still smaller and fainter about 1' following [NGC 1046]."  John Herschel measured a fairly accurate position on 8 Jan 1828 (sweep 118) and wrote "vF the p[receding] of two; a * 10m, p[receding] in same line.".

Forms a similar pair with NGC 1048A 1.0' SW.  It was moderately to fairly bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 30"x15", bright core, mottled appearance.  LEDA 1002216, a compact companion, is just 30" S.  It appeared faint (V = 16.8), very small, round, 10" diameter, low surface brightness.


17.5" (11/26/94): at first glance, appeared as an ill-defined faint glow 1' S of a mag 14 star.  One closer inspection, NGC 1048 resolved into a pair of small, faint galaxies 1.0' between centers oriented NNE-SSW.  The northern member (generally identified as NGC 1048) was clearly brighter and elongated 2:1 E-W, 0.6'x0.3'.  Just 1.0' SSW is a fainter companion (NGC 1048A).  Located 7' SSE of the large, low surface brightness system NGC 1042 within a large group.


17.5" (11/1/86): large, very diffuse system best viewed at 83x. There was a slight brightening to the south but the fainter companion was not clearly resolved in poor seeing.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1048 = Sw. III-19 on 10 Nov 1885 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  His position matches the contact pair PGC 10137 and 10140, and he perhaps viewed the combined glow of both.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1049 = h2492 on 19 Oct 1835 and reported "pretty bright; small; round; like a star 12th magnitude a very little rubbed at the edges, a curious little object and easily mistaken for a star, which, however, it certainly is not".  His position is 1' N of this Fornax Dwarf globular.  The galaxy itself was discovered over a century later by Harlow Shapley in 1938 while at the Boyden Station in South Africa on photographic plates taken with the 24" Bruce refractor.

The fainter portion of the galaxy on the north side of the dust lane was clearly visible paralleling the central region.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1055 = H I-1 = H II-6? = h258 on 19 Dec 1783 (early sweep 53?).  His summary description (based on 7 observations) reads "cB, cL, iF, bM."  He possibly found NGC 1055 the night before, noting H II-6 as "a small nebula. It is like a very small comet, not visible in the finder 1/2?."  He estimated the position as roughly 1/2? north of Delta Ceti and later commented "This has probably been a telescopic comet, as I have not been able to find it again, notwithstanding the assistance of a drawing which represents the telescopic stars in its neighbourhood."  In the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues, Dreyer suggested H. II 6 was equivalent to NGC 1055 and added the note "very rough sketch shows it in line with 2 stars preceding and one following."  Steinicke, though, equates H. II 6 with a pair of stars at 02 40 19.5 +00 54 37 (2000), which fits Dreyer's comments.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1059 = h259 on 25 Jan 1832 and simply noted "eF, hardly sure."  There is nothing nonstellar near his position but just 1' SE is a close pair of mag 14 stars at 10" separation.  Several observers looked for Herschel's object.  Heinrich d'Arrest was unable to find anything "on a very clear night" and Sherburne Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) also carefully searched unsuccessfully for the object, although in sweeping around he discovered IC 248.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, and Dorothy Carlson in her NGC errata paper identify NGC 1059 with this double star. See Corwin's notes.

Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 1062 on 11 Oct 1873 as observing assistant on the 72" at Birr Castle.  He placed this object with respect to NGC 1061 at 116.8" in PA 97.6 deg (ESE). At this offset (1.9' ESE of NGC 1061) is an extremely faint star.  RNGC and RC3 (as well as SIMBAD and other sources) misidentify UGC 2201 = PGC 10331 as NGC 1062.  This galaxy is located over 6' ENE of NGC 1061.  See my RNGC Corrections #2 and Corwin's notes.

Forms a pair with brighter MCG -2-7-72 6.8' SSE (on the first observation of the field, this galaxy was assumed to be NGC 1064) and it is surprising that Leavenworth did not pick up MCG -2-7-72.


NGC 1064 is a face-on spiral with a small core and much fainter arms (halo) and I missed it twice from the brighter skies east of Mt Hamilton.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1064 = LM 2-345 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His position is just 0.2 tsec west of MCG -02-07-071 = PGC 10249.

48" (10/26/11): at 375x; the view through Lowrey's 48-inch was remarkable.  Spiral arm structure was easily visible with two main arms in the central halo and a bright inner arm around the nucleus and core.  The bright inner arm attaches at the east side of the intense core, wraps tightly clockwise around the north side of the core and heads south on the west side of the core.  There were two main arms in the central halo forming an elongated "S" pattern.  A long spiral arm is attached near the east side of the core and wraps clockwise outside the inner arm described above.  It continues around to the west side and heads south, ending near a compact HII knot ([EKS96] 19 from Evans et al 1996 "Atlas of H II Regions in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies").  A second long spiral arm is attached on the southwest side of the core and wraps clockwise to the east side of the core, passing inside of a 10" HII knot [EKS96] 79/80].  The arm rotates to the northern edge of the halo.  Besides these main arms, several fainter sections of additional arms are tightly wrapped in the central halo.  The main central region of the galaxy is encased in a very large, low surface brightness outer halo, extendng ~6'x5' WSW-ENE.  NGC 1055, part of the M77 group, lies 30' NNE.


18" (10/21/06): very bright, fairly large oval, extended 4:3 SW-NE, ~3.5'x2.5'.  Sharply concentrated with a very bright, oval core containing a sharp, very bright stellar nucleus.  There was a strong impression of mottling or spiral structure in the halo with a curving dust lane (gap between the spiral arms) embedded in the halo that swings around from the southwest side of the halo towards the north along the west side of the core.  Inner arm detail was also suggested around the edge of the halo with an impression of mottling or turbulence.  A mag 11 star is just off the SE side, ~1.5' from the center.


17.5" (11/14/87): very bright, moderately large, sharp concentration with an unusually bright core, almost stellar nucleus, diffuse slightly elongated halo.  Appears mottled at high power and a hint of inner arm structure.  A mag 11 star is 1.3' ESE of the center.  This is a Seyfert 2 galaxy and brightest in a group with NGC 1055 and 1073..


8" (11/28/81): bright, intense core, faint halo.


Pierre M?chain discovered M77 = NGC 1068 = h262 on 29 Oct 1780.  William Herschel described M77 as "Very bright; an irregular extended nucleus with milky chevelure, 3 or 4' long, near 3' broad."


Lord Rosse's assistant Johnstone Stoney recorded M77 on 22 Dec 1848 as "a blue spiral?" and it was included in the list of "Spiral or curvilinear" object in Rosse's 1850 PT paper.  Observing assistant Bindon Stoney made a sketch on 24 Nov 1851 (the description reads "The central part is, I am nearly sure, spiral") shown on plate XXV, figure 6 in LdR's 1861 paper (also Plate 1, Figure 4 in the 1880 publication).  William Lassell's 1863 sketch, made using 760x with his 48-inch from Malta, shows a tight spiral emanating from a bright stellar nucleus and wrapping a full 360?.


Isaac Roberts' photograph in 1892 revealed considerable structure in the central region with a "dense composite nucleus, bounded by a broad nebulous ring, which is studded with strong condensations.."

?douard Stephan discovered NGC 1072 = St XII-24 on 20 Dec 1881.  His position matches UGC 2208 = PGC 10315.  Stephane Javelle (III-945) independently found the galaxy on 24 Jan 1898 and reported it as new in discovery list 3-945 (later IC 1837), but Harold Corwin comments that he reversed the sign of his declination offset from his reference star.  Once corrected, IC 1837 = NGC 1072.  Although this is a reasonable assumption (it occured in several other cases), it's odd that Javelle described NGC 1072 as round as it appeared noticeably elongated in both of my observations.

48" (10/24/14): at 488x; the central bar is very bright and well-defined, extending 1.0'x0.3' SW-NE. An easily visible spiral arm is attached at the northeast end of the bar and extends at a right angle to the northwest, passing through a mag 16 star [50" N of center].  The arm then dims but sweeps clockwise around the west side, and merges with the second arm attached at the southwest end of the bar. As a result, the galaxy appears to have a single continuous arm rotating ~270? and ending on the southeast side, ~1.2' from center!  The outer part of the halo has a low surface brightness but extends at least 4' in diameter.  Another mag 16 star is on the southwest side of the halo [1.4' from center].


At least three HII complexes were identified.  The brightest is NGC 1073:[HK 83] 6/9, an elongated patch ~13"x8" E-W, situated at or just beyond the southeast end of the spiral arm [1.4' from center].  A small, fainter knot close west, [HK83] 19, was difficult to resolve.  [HK83] 69, a faint 10" knot, is on the west side of the halo (beyond the arm) [1.4' due west of center].  Finally, [HK83] 49 is a third 10" knot of low contrast in the northwest outer halo [1.9' NNW of center].  The designations are from Hodge and Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of HII Regions in 125 Galaxies".

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): NGC 1097 was one of the top highlights of my October 2015 trip to Australia.  At 303x; this showpiece barred spiral contains a bright central bar ~4.5'x1.5' NW-SE. The bar is sharply concentrated with an extremely bright, slightly elongated NW-SE core but no distinct stellar nucleus.


A prominent spiral arm is attached on the northwest end of the bar.  The arm is relatively thin, well defined and knotty as it curls counterclockwise to the east, dimming out gradually about 3' ENE of center.  A large bright knot is close to the northwest end of the bar, just inside the beginning of the arm and close east of a superimposed mag 14.5 star.  NED catalogues this region with the multiple designations NGC 1097:[EKS96] 148 and [EKS96] 151 from the 1996 "An Atlas of H II Regions in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies" in ApJS, 105, 93.  Roughly halfway along its length is a pair of fairly prominent HII knots.  The first is [EKS96] 245, a 12" knot 2.5' NNE of center.  Close east is slightly larger [EKS96] 300/304, 2.5' NE of center. The arm then fades as it passes just south of a mag 15 star.


At the southeast end of the bar a delicate, thin spiral arm unfurls counterclockwise towards the northwest.  About halfway along its length is a slightly brighter elongated patch extending ~30" in length, with designations [EKS96] 100/105/119 and others.  The arm dims out about 3' WSW of center.  The arms stretch about 6' tip to tip, giving overall dimensions of perhaps 7'x6'.


The satellite galaxy NGC 1097A is superimposed in the halo on the northwest side, 3.3' from center.  It appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 40"x20".


18" (12/30/08): very bright, large, very elongated NW-SE.  The brightest portion is the entire central "bar" which extends ~5'x1.5'.  This region is surrounded by a much fainter "halo", increasing the size to ~5'x3'.  The center is strongly concentrated to a very bright 50"x40" core, slightly elongated NW-SE.  At the northwest end of the bar, a very diffuse arm sweeps to the east in a counterclockwise direction for ~2.5' in length and appears to brighten or have a faint knot near the end.  At the southeast end of the bar, only a hint of a short extension sweeping west was detected.  A faint star (mag ~14.5) is along the west side at the northwest end of the main bar, near where the brighter arm is attached.  NGC 1097A, a small companion galaxy, is situated just off the NW side and appeared faint, very small, irregularly round, 25"x20".


17.5" (10/17/87): very bright, very large, very elongated NW-SE, very bright core.  A companion galaxy NGC 1097A is attached at the NW end.


8" (10/13/81): bright, elongated NW-SE, bright core.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1097 = H V-48 =h2495 on 9 Oct 1790 (sweep 972) and logged "vB; E 75? np to sf; about 8' long.  A very bright nucleus confined to a small part about 1' diameter."  John Herschel recorded this barred spiral on 18 Nov 1835 from the Cape as "B, L, vmE, pspmbM, 3' long; pos = 151.1?." The next night he logged "B, L, vmE, psvmbM to a pL, R nucleus; 4' long, 40" broad."


Dunlop's D 625 possibly refers to NGC 1097, although his position is too rough to make a positive identification.  He found a "round nebula, about 2' dia, very bright at the centre, and very faint from the centre to the margin , almost equally faint from the bright nucleus to the margin.  There are two pretty bright small stars following the nebula rather north."

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1098 = LM 1-67, along with NGC 1091 = I-65 and NGC 1092 = I-66, on 17 Oct 1885.  There is nothing at his position but 2 tmin east and 2' north is ESO 546-014 = PGC 10403.  Leavenworth noted this was the "1st of 3" [with NGC 1099 and 1100] and this secures the identification.  Ormond Stone and Herbert Howe later measured accurate positions (Stone's is given in the IC 1 notes).

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1105 = LM 1-71 on 2 Dec 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at his position but Harold Corwin examined Leavenworth's discovery sketch and it matches PGC 10333, which is located 4.5 min of RA west of his position.


This galaxy was independently discovered by Herbert Howe on 30 Jan 1900, probably while searching for NGC 1105 at the NGC position, and reported it as new in list 3-7 (later IC 1840).   So, NGC 1105 = IC 1840.  Howe mentions he was unable to recover NGC 1105 but found a candidate (MCG -03-08-036 = PGC 10867) 4 minutes of RA east of the NGC position which he suggested might be NGC 1105.  Dreyer reported the "corrected" position in the IC 2 notes.  Because of this "correction", PGC 10867 is labeled as NGC 1105 in the RNGC, MCG, PGC, LEDA, etc., although this was not the galaxy found by Leavenworth. See Corwin's notes.  I've taken PGC 10333 as NGC 1105 here.

The NGC identification of this galaxy is very uncertain due to poor positions in the group by Marth and UGC, MCG and CGCG identify this galaxy as IC 1846.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 1109 = m 75 on 2 Dec 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and simply noted "vF".  This is the first in a group of 8 that he discovered that night, several of which (NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117) have identification problems because of poor positions or perhaps he confused some faint stars as nebulous.  There is nothing near his position for NGC 1109.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1109 may refer to UGC 2265 = PGC 10573, which is 2 tmin of RA west of Marth's position but matches in declination.  Stephane Javelle later discovered this galaxy at the Nice Observatory on 7 Jan 1896, gave an accurate position, and it was catalogued as IC 1846. So, NGC 1109 is possibly IC 1846, though other objects on the same night seem to have different offsets in RA and based on all the problems here this identification is uncertain.


Modern catalogues, including RC3, RNGC, PGC and LEDA identify IC 1852 as NGC 1109.  This galaxy is 39 sec of RA west and 2' S of Marth's position.  Although closer in RA, IC 1852 is further off in declination (a less likely error) and Corwin equates NGC 1112 and IC 1852.  Courtney Seligman suggests IC 1850 as a better candidate for NGC 1109.  This galaxy is 1.0 min of RA west of Marth's position and matches in declination, though  Corwin suggests NGC 1111 = IC 1850.  So, lots of uncertainty.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 1111 = m 76 on 2 Dec 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and noted "F, vS, stellar".

Courtney Seligman notes that IC 1850 could just as easily be equated with NGC 1109, as Marth's positions for these two entries are very close.  RNGC, PGC and HyperLEDA label PGC 10719 as NGC 1111.  This galaxy is only 8 sec of RA east, but 6' S of Marth's position (a less likely error).  So, the identification of NGC 1111 is quite uncertain but taken as IC 1850 here.

Marth's position falls very close to a 10th magnitude star, though it is very unlikely Marth could have described this star as "vF" and there are no other non-stellar candidates due west or east.  Corwin suggests that NGC 1113 may refer to a 15th magnitude star 2' NW (position given here) of the bright star, though this is very speculative.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1123 = H II-601 = h270 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) and logged "F, S, iF, resolvable."  His position is within 2' of UGC 2353 = PGC 10890.  John Herschel wrote on 18 Sep 1828 (sweep 182), "vF R; vgbM; 25" diameter."  Lewis Swift independently "discovered" the galaxy on 6 Sep 1885, resulting in a second designation NGC 1122.  As the positions for NGC 1122 and NGC 1123 are so close, it is very surprising Dreyer included both entries in the NGC. All modern catalogues identify this galaxy as NGC 1122 although by historical priority, NGC 1123 should take precedence.

The redshift of MCG -03-08-034 is nearly 3x that of NGC 1089, so they don't form a physical pair.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1125 = H III-450 = h272 on 6 Oct 1785 (sweep 459) and noted "vF, S, E."  His position is accurate, though falls closer to the fainter southwest component (MCG -03-08-034).  The northeast component (MCG -03-08-035 = PGC 10851) is generally identified as NGC 1125.

24" (11/23/19): at 375x; fairly faint, fairly small, elongated ~2:1 N-S.  This merged double system was easily resolved with the two nuclei separated by 16" N-S.  The northern nucleus was noticeably brighter and well defined, ~12" diameter.  The southern nucleus had a lower surface brightness and the edge faded out more gradually into the common halo that enclosed both nuclei.  A mag 13.6 star is 1' W and a mag 12.6 star is 1' SW.


18" (11/22/08): on initial glance the brightest galaxy in AGC 400 appeared faint, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 25"x18". I soon realized this was an extremely close contact pair oriented N-S with two tangent knots (described in the professional literature as a "dumb-bell system") just 16" between centers in a very small common halo.  Each component was no more than 15" in diameter with the southern member brighter.


17.5" (11/28/97): very faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 40"x20", irregular surface brightness.  On careful examination the glow resolved into a very close pair of extremely small galaxies oriented N-S with tangent halos [just 16" between centers!].  This double system is the brightest in AGC 400 with CGCG 415-040 3.5' SW.


The identification of this galaxy with NGC 1128 is very uncertain.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1128 = Sw. V-48 on 8 Oct 1886 with the 16-inch refractor at Warner Observatory and recorded "eF; S; lE; 2 pF stars close preceding."  There are no good candidates near Swift's position.


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 1128 is CGCG 415-041 = PGC 11189 +11188, the brightest galaxy (double) in Abell Galaxy Cluster 400.  Swift's position is 5 minutes of RA to the west, though Corwin notes that several other objects found by Swift in October 1886 have similar 5 minute errors (NGC 885, 1677, 1689).  Two mag 12-13 stars just west of this galaxy fit Swift's description.


Interestingly, William Herschel might have first seen this double system.  On 30 Sep 1786 (sweep 607), he recorded "Some small stars with suspected nebulosity, probably a deception."  Although it was never catalogued, his position is just 1' northwest of CGCG 415-041!

William Herschel discovered NGC 1129 = H II-602 = h271 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) and logged "F, pS, iR, lbM."  John Herschel wrote on 18 Sep 1828 (sweep 182), "vF; R vglbM; 30" diameter."  Their positions match UGC 2373 = PGC 10959, the brightest member of a cluster. MCG +07-07-003 is superimposed on its southwest side.


Using the 72" in Oct 1854, R.J. Mitchell noted "has either a F* sp or is double".  This refers to MCG +07-07-003, which MCG misidentified this galaxy as NGC 1129.  In December, he noted "suspect the supposed neb close sp edge to be only a faint double star.  Finally in Dec 1855, Mitchell observed with Lord Rosse, who "thought the companion on sp edge to be merely a neb with a * for centre."  Because of the uncertainty, Dreyer didn't assign an NGC designation to MCG +07-07-003.

Corwin suggests PGC 197768, situated 1.9' N of NGC 1130, as another possible candidate, but this galaxy is fainter and was not picked up in my observation.

IC 267 is 10' SSE and UGC 2362 is 7' W.


Arp noted "Splash appearance on west side [tidal plume] of galaxy points to low surface brightness companion 7' [west]."  The companion he referred to is UGC 2362, which is possibly interacting (the pair has identical redshifts).

His position is 1.5' NW of NGC 1136 and 2' S of ESO 154-018 = PGC 10800.  Since there are two NGC numbers as well as two nearby galaxies, ESO 154-018 is taken as NGC 1135 in PGC, ESO, SGC, NED, SIMBAD and Steinicke's Historic NGC.


If this identification is correct, NGC 1135 is John Herschel?s faintest discovery at B = 16.2.  But then why did he classify it as "Faint", instead of "Extremely Faint" (his faintest class)?  Instead, Harold Corwin argues NGC 1135 is a duplicate observation of NGC 1136 (discovered earlier on 5 Dec 1834), despite Herschel stating they were two different objects.  HyperLeda is the only online catalogue that equates NGC 1135 and 1136.

This galaxy was probably also later recorded by Herschel as h2498 (closer to ESO 154-019), and it received the designation NGC 1135.

There is nothing at his position (not found by Fath in 1914 on Mt. Wilson plates), however 40' S is the double system NGC 1143 and 1144, independently found by ?douard Stephan (VIIIa-10 and VIIIa-11) on 17 Nov 1876 and accurately placed. This pair is generally identified as NGC 1143 and 1144 due to the unambiguous identification. Several other objects discovered that night by Marth have large positional errors.

Slightly fainter of an interacting pair with highly disrupted NGC 1144, just 35" between centers.  The eastern portion of the outer halo of NGC 1143 is merged or overlaps with the halo of NGC 1144 on its northwestern side.  2MASX J02550661-0009448, listed as a 2nd "collider" with NGC 1144 in Madore's 2009 Atlas and Catalogue of Collisional Rings, lies 1.2' NW.  The 2MASS galaxy appeared fairly faint, small, very elongated 3:1 N-S, 0.4'x0.15', stellar nucleus.


17.5" (1/7/89): very faint, very small, round.  In a common halo with NGC 1144 0.5' ESE.  This galaxy is the slightly fainter of the pair.


?douard Stephan found NGC 1143 = St VIIIa-11 (along with NGC 1144 = St VIIIa-10) on 17 Nov 1876 with the 31" reflector at Marseille Observatory.  His position is accurate.  This galaxy was first discovered by Marth on 5 Jan 1864 but his position was 40' too far N (also NGC 1142), so he did not receive credit.  But it clear that NGC 1143 = NGC 1141 and NGC 1144 = NGC 1142.

This galaxy was discovered by Albert Marth on 5 Jan 1864 and catalogued as NGC 1142, but his position was 40' too far N.  So, NGC 1144 = NGC 1142.  Based on the earlier discovery, NGC 1142 should be the primary designation, but due to Marth's poor position, Stephan's number has been used.

Charles Sanders Peirce (son of Benjamin Peirce) discovered NGC 1170 = HN 38 on 31 Dec 1869 at Harvard College Observatory using the 15-inch Merz & Mahler refractor (Annals of Harvard Obs, Vol 13, #47).  An approximate position is given in the Harvard Observatory list based on comparison with Comet 1869 III.  A very close, unequal double star is near Peirce's position at 03 02 29.6 +27 03 20 (2000).  But the description "J.W. and C.S.P. independently think the sky generally bright f and a little n of the comet for 14' or more (several fields according to C.S.P.)" implies that the observation refers to an extremely large object and Corwin and Steinicke suggest the observation perhaps refers to the actual tail of the comet!  This is the only object in the NGC attributed to Peirce (mispelled as Pierce in the NGC).   Classified as nonexistent in the RNGC.  See Corwin's comments.

Lewis Swift found NGC 1174 = Sw. IV-11 on 31 Aug 1883 and recorded "vF; pS; lE; in contact on preceding side with a pB*; D* np point to it about 4.5"."  There is nothing at his position but 1 minute of RA further east is NGC 1186 and Swift's detailed description of the star in contact and the nearby double star clinches the equivalence.  So, NGC 1174 = NGC 1186, with discovery priority to Herschel (H. IV-43).


Rudolph Spitaler first mentioned the equivalence in AN, 127, 91.  He wrote "I could not find NGC 1174.  Close to Swift's place are crowded four or five faint stars; About 6 seconds before the alleged position, I temporarily thought I noticed something nebulous, but I can not vouch for it. According to Swift's description, I rather believe that the place is in error by 1 minute and this nebula is identical to NGC 1186. This is supported by the remark "D[ouble] * np points to it about 4.5"."  If the two nebulae were not identical, this would have to mean: "D * nf, etc.", where "D *" undoubtedly refers to the double star DM 42?694.  Incidentally, according to Swift's description in NGC, it must also be called "pB * close following" instead of "pB * close preceding".

William Herschel discovered NGC 1186 = H IV-43 = h281 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) and reported "a pretty S star with a very F nebulosity to the nf side, of very little extent." On 24 Oct 1786 (sweep 621), he noted "a pretty B star with two faint branches." John Herschel also described it on 23 Dec 1831 (sweep 389) as "a star 14m with some kind of faint nebulous appendage."  The NGC position is accurate although Herschel's class IV refers to objects that appeared to be planetary nebulae.


R.J. Mitchell and Samuel Hunter, observing assistants on the 72", both failed to find this galaxy and d'Arrest tried to follow up in 1863 but was also unsuccessful. Bigourdan observed it though, and suggested it was a "variable nebula", because of the mixed results.  Rudolph Spitaler also observed it on 12 Mar 1891 with the 27-inch Vienna refractor and described it as "elongated NW-SE, but its boundaries are not so regularly shaped it could be described as elliptical. On its south preceding side is a mag 11 star. In the southeast side the nebula is limited by two faint stars, but at times the edge of the nebula seems to stretch beyond these. The brightest part is northeast of the former star. I estimate the length to be 2'."


Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy and superimposed star on 31 Aug 1883 but placed Sw. IV-11 one minute of RA too far west.  Dreyer took this as a different object and it was catalogued as NGC 1174.  So, NGC 1174 = NGC 1186.

Although Leavenworth only gave a rough RA for these objects, Herbert Howe measured accurate individual RA's in 1899-00 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes section).  In this case, Howe's corrected RA is a good match with  MCG -03-08-068 = PGC 11533.  It is interesting to note that this places NGC 1188 just 8' N of NGC 1199, which is the brightest member of HCG 22.  The RNGC incorrectly equates NGC 1188 with NGC 1199 and the MCG does not label MCG -03-08-068 as MCG.

His position falls on a blank piece of sky between two mag 13.1 and 14.2 stars.

?douard Stephan discovered NGC 1198 = St XI-7 on 6 Dec 1880 with the 31" reflector at Marseille Observatory.  His position matches UGC 2533 = MCG +07-07-024.  MCG doesn't label this galaxy as NGC 1198.  Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy on 27 Dec 1888 and reported in discovery list VIII-12 (later IC 282), "eF, S, R, bet 2 nr stars".  Swift's position was 1 min of RA too far west, so Dreyer assumed it was a different object, the description applies to NGC 1198.  So, NGC 1198 = IC 282, with priority to Stephan.  Harold Corwin and Malcolm Thomson agree with this equivalence.

NGC 1200 forms a close pair with IC 285 3.2' ESE.  The IC companion was logged as "very faint, small, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, very low even surface brightness."


William Herschel discovered NGC 1200 = H II-475 = h2506 on 27 Nov 1785 (sweep 478) and noted "pF, pL, irr F, bM."

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1202 = LM 2-354 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 15.5, 0.3' dia, wide double star, position 45? (NE) at 4' distance.  His position is ~30 tsec of RA east of PGC 11593, but his description of the double star is a perfect match.  Bigourdan's position for IC 286, which he claimed to have found while searching for this galaxy, is very close to NGC 1202 and Corwin notes that his offset stars don't match the field.  So, IC 286 is lost unless his offset stars can be recovered.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1203 = LM 1-85 on 1 Jan 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position is a good match with  MCG -03-08-070/071 = PGC 11603/11599.  This is a close double system with the brighter component (identified as NGC 1203A in NED and MCG) on the south side.  The magnitudes are reversed (brighter mag associated with the northern component) in several sources.  It's likely Leavenworth saw the combined glow of both objects as I could pick out the northern component.  Howe called this object "extremely faint and very small", with no indication of a companion.

A mag 14.5 star is 45" SW (outside the glow) and a mag 15.3 star is just 15" SE of the brighter star.  Member of the NGC 1200 group (USGC S110).


17.5" (11/17/01): interesting object as it appears as a diffuse glow, elongated ENE-WSW with three stars near including a mag 11 star attached at the south edge.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1204 = LM 1-86 on 26 Dec 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and reported "mag 15.5, E 45?, B* and sev F stars inv in neb, resolvable."  His position is a good match with MCG -02-08-045 = PGC 11583 and the description is appropriate for this galaxy.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes) and mentions "I noticed simply a small triangle of stars of mags 11, 12, and 13.  The brightest star seemed to be enveloped in an extremely faint mantle of nebulous matter."


Recently (27 Mar 2015), I found that WH observed NGC 1204 on 27 Nov 1785 (sweep 478), though he only logged "a deception", and didn't assign it an internal discovery number or H-designation.  His offset in position from #1193 = NGC 1200 (the previous object in the sweep), places the "deception" just 1.2' south of NGC 1204, based on Corwin's reduction (Steinicke also confirms this observation).  Based on my visual notes, I can see why WH found the appearance ambiguous.

There is nothing at his position but 2 min of RA west is PGC 11511 and Stone's description applies (except his PA should read 125?).  This was Stone's second observation of this galaxy.  His position for I-84 = NGC 1182 was 1.0 min of west too far west, but the descriptions are virtually the same.  Herbert Howe examined the field in 1899-00 and report "having examined the locality very carefully on two fine nights I judge the objects to be identical."  Based on this this observation, Dreyer states in the IC 2 Notes that "1205 is equal to 1182".  Either number could be the primary designation as the earlier observation is not known.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1210 = LM 1-88 on 13 Nov 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and reported "mag 15.0, vS, iR, E 340??, gbMN".

Truman Safford  discovered NGC 1211 = Sf 102 on 31 Oct 1867 with the 18.5" refractor at the Dearborn Observatory.  Stephan independently discovered the galaxy on 27 Nov 1880, published it in list XI-8 and measured an accurate position.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1212 = Sw. I-5 on 18 Oct 1884 with the 16" refractor at the Warner Observatory and recorded "S; R; vvF.  Right angled with 2 stars.  In field with Algol".  Swift's position is poor, 40 seconds of RA west of UGC 2560, but his description of the two stars applies to this galaxy.  E.E. Barnard independently found NGC 1212 on 26 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick and comunicated the discovery directly to Dreyer.  Barnard and Dreyer assumed this was a new object, probably due to Swift's poor position, and it was recataloged as IC 1883.  So, NGC 1212 = IC 1883, with discovery priority to Swift.


RNGC and PGC (as well as secondary sources such as Megastar) misidentify PGC 11761, an extremely faint galaxy just 8' SE of Algol, as NGC 1212.  This galaxy is not only too faint to have been seen by Swift, it is nearly lost in the glare of Algol.  See Corwin's notes.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1213 = Sw. I-6 on 14 Oct 1884 with his 16" refractor and recorded "vvF; lE; v diff; F* close north."  His position is 0.4 min of RA west of UGC 2557 and his description fits (there are faint stars close north and south).  Bigourdan (B. 253) found this galaxy again on 10 Jan 1891 (he misidentified a star as NGC 1213) and assumed it was new.  His position for B. 253 (later IC 1881) is accurate. So, NGC 1213 = IC 1881.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1214 = LM 1-94 = Sw. V-49, along with NGC 1215 and 1216, in 1886 using the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Stone reported, "mag 14.0, 0.7'x0.2', E 60?."  He added a note, "48 seconds f[ollowing] G.C. 647 [NGC 1208] same declination, stellar N[ucleus] in cen of vF neb; 1st of 3 [with NGC 1215 and 1216]; *10, P 15? Delta [separation] 3'."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is essentially correct.


Lewis Swift also found this galaxy on 21 Oct 1886.  He described it as "F; pS; iR; 647 [= NGC 1208] nr; 1st of 2 [with NGC 1215]."  Frank Muller suggested the equivalence with Stone's object in a Sidereal Messenger article (Feb 1887) that listed nebulae from Swift's 5th catalogue which had been discovered previously.  As the Leander McCormick discovery list was submitted to the Astronomical Journal on 12 Oct 1886, the discovery credit goes to Stone.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1215 = LM 1-95 = Sw. V-50, along with NGC 1214 and 1216, in 1886 using the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Stone reported, "mag 15.5, 0.4', dif."  He added the note, "2nd of 3 [with NGC 1214 and 1216]."  His declination is 2' too far south, incorrectly placing NGC 1215 1' south of NGC 1216, instead of 1' N.

17.5" (11/10/96): faintest in a group with NGC 1228, NGC 1229 and IC 1892.  Only glimpsed momentarily using Vicker's CCD Atlas.  Appears extremely faint and small, 10" diameter with possible extensions to 20".  Located 3.8' SSE of NGC 1228 and 1.9' SE of NGC 1230.  IC 1892 lies 5' further SE.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1230 = LM 2-361, along with NGC 1228 and NGC 1229, in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Leavenworth made no estimate of size or brightness, only the comment "*??".  There is nothing at his position, but 1 min of RA west and 2' N is ESO 480-033 = PGC 11734.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes).

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1231 = LM 1-97 on 2 Dec 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory, recording "mag 16.0, pL, E like a fan."  There is nothing at his rough position (given to an nearest min of RA and arcmin of Dec).  But exactly 4 min of RA west is MCG -03-08-074 = PGC 11658.  MCG doesn't label this galaxy as NGC 1231.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  Assuming NGC 1231 = PGC 11658, I'm a little surprised Leavenworth didn't mention NGC 1209, just 6' SW, but I don't think this is a duplicate observation of NGC 1209 as it is much too bright to be called mag 16.0.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): NGC 1232 is a face-on multi-arm knotty Sc-type.  At 303x it appeared very bright, very large, roundish, at least 6' diameter.  It was sharply concentrated with a very bright, elongated core that contained a brighter central bar-like nuclear region.  Spiral structure was evident in the large halo, but more subtle than I expected as several segments were disconnected.  The most prominent was a knotty arm on the north side.  It emerged near the northwest end of the core and shot linearly (2' length) towards the northeast in the direction of a mag 14 star 2.5' NE of center.


Another spiral arm extended east and west perhaps 1.5' length, just south of the central region.  The arm faded out at its west end but after a short break, a very faint elongated knot, ~14"x8", was visible 1.7' WSW of center.  NED includes multiple designations NGC 1232:[HK83] 442, [HK83] 445, [HK83] 450 and more from Hodge and Kennicutt's 1983 "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies".  The arm dimmed again but could just be traced shooting straight N-S in the northwest end of the halo.  Another short, linear segment of a arm (containing [HK83] 110) was just visible close east of the core, 1.1' ENE of center.


NGC 1232A (the subject of a long-standing redshift controversy) was visible 4.1' ESE of center, just beyond the east edge of the galaxy.  It appeared very faint, small, round, ~20" diameter


17.5" (10/8/88): bright, large, slightly elongated, bright core, very large faint halo.  Located 8' WSW of mag 8.6 SAO 168347.


13.1" (1/18/85): large, large bright core, substellar nucleus, very diffuse outer halo.  An arm is suspected attached at the west end and winding towards the east on the north side of the core.


8" (10/13/81): faint, diffuse, low surface brightness.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1232 = H II-258 = h2509 on 20 Oct 1784 (sweep 303) recording "eF, lbM, 7 or 8' dia."  On 19 Dec 1799 (sweep 1091) he logged "F, cL, bM, irr F, 5 or 5' diam.  The nebulosity is unequal, seeming to be two or three clouds or nebulosities joined together." John Herschel made 3 observations at the Cape.  His most detailed observation reads, "B; vL; R; resolvable; 3' (dia), first very grad then psbM.  With the left eye I see it mottled. (N.B. This is no doubt a distant globular cluster)."


Based on a photograph taken at the Helwan observatory in 1921-22, NGC 1232 was described as "pB, 7'x7', open spiral, B stellar nucleus, many branches with almost stellar condensations."  NGC 1232B = PGC 11834, near the end of one of the spiral arms, was assumed to be interacting with NGC 1232, but its redshift places it four times the distance.  Due to the apparent discordan redshift, NGC 1232/1232A was used by Arp to argue against redshift-based distances.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1235 = Sw. V-51 on 21 Oct 1886 with the 16" refractor at the Warner Observatory.  There are no galaxies near his position.  The RNGC identifies NGC 1235 as a triple star, situated about 1.5' N of Swift's position.  But these stars appear too bright and too easily resolved to be confused with a faint nebulous object by Swift.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1235 may be a duplicate of NGC 1233, which is located due north.  If this identification is correct, Swift made a 24' error in declination (too far south).  Except for NGC 58, the other dozen discoveries by Swift on that night have no significant errors, so this identification is very uncertain.  See Corwin's notes.

WH's position was poor but John Herschel was only able to correct the declination, as the nebula was "scarcely seen through thick haze" (sweep 96).

There is nothing near his position and Bigourdan was unsuccessful (twice) in trying to recover this object.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, notes "*13.5 in Dreyer's place".  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 1240 is a double star (11" separation) about 8' southeast of WH's position.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1252 = h2515 on 4 Dec 1834, recording a "Star 8m, the chief of a cluster of 18 or 20 stars."  His Cape catalogue position corresponds with mag 6.6 HD 20037 at 03 10 39.2 -57 48 35 (2000), the brightest in this 10' group.  Apparently JH made a copying error after he precessed his coordinates to 1860 for the General Catalogue (#663) as his position there is exactly 20' too far south.  Dreyer didn't catch this mistake so it carried over into the NGC.  As a result, ESO says "Not found" and RNGC classifies NGC 1252 as an "unverified southern object", both using the erroneous NGC position.


The group of stars at Herschel's position has been considered an asterism as most of the brighter stars have different proper motion using Hipparchos and ACT data. See Baumgardt "The nature of some doubtful open clusters as revealed by HIPPARCOS" (A&A, 340, 402, 1998).  But a more recent paper by de la Fuente Marcos, et al.

The arm appears patchy with a couple of small knots near the outer edge (~1.6' from center).  The arm on the west end is harder to make out as it emerges from the central region near the superimposed star and is not as well defined, appearing more as a hazy, mottled region with some brighter patches.  A mag 12 star lies 3' ENE and just beyond the star is NGC 1253A, a low surface brightness dwarf.  NGC 1253A appeared fairly faint, large, irregular, roughly oval 3:2 E-W, 1.2'x0.8', small brighter core, very patchy appearance (contains HII knots).  The nearby mag 12 star is just off the SW side.


24" (12/1/13):  NGC 1253A was picked up as a very faint to faint glow, elongated 2:1 E-W, 0.4'x0.2' (central region seen), low surface brightness.  Situated 3.9' ENE of much brighter NGC 1253 and just 0.9' NE of a mag 12 star.  NGC 1253 showed a little structure but I didn't take notes.


17.5" (1/7/89): moderately bright, oval ~E-W, no central brightening but contains a slightly brighter knot at the NE end.  A mag 12 star is involved at the west end 52" from the center and a mag 11 star is 2.9' ENE of center.  Forms a double system with NGC 1253A 3.7' ENE (just following the mag 11 star) which was not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1253 = H IV-17 on 20 Sep 1784 (sweep 280), reporting "a small star with a vF nebulous brush following, discovered with 240x. The brush was faint and about 1.5' or 2' long.  A star on each side which viewed were free from that brush that I drew them in the same part of the field."  His position was 6' too far south (at the beginning of this sweep, he noted "The rope being broken the PD is coarsely marked in revolutions of the axel").  d'Arrest corrected the position on 4 Jan 1864 and made a total of 4 accurate positions.

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 212x, the resolution was a bit better in the halo than with the 18", but the blazing core was still unresolved.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1261 = D 337 = h2517 on 28 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta and described "a very bright round nebula, about 1.5' diameter, pretty well defined and gradually bright to the centre. A small star north following."  No mention is made of resolution, though it should have been possible (brightest stars mag 13.5).


JH observed the cluster twice, first describing it on 5 Dec 1834 as a "globular, bright; large; irregularly round; 2.5' diameter; all resolved into equal stars 14 mag.  Has a star 9th mag 45? N.f. 3' distant."  On his second sweep he logged "pretty bright; round; very gradually brighter in the middle; 3' across; resolved into stars of 15th magnitude. A very faint nebula (??) precedes."

In January 2017 I wrote Harold Corwin regarding my observation:  "[I] initially was stumped on NGC 1265. It took me a minute or two to notice NGC 1265 as a relatively large, diffuse glow surrounding a fairly bright star that is superimposed. The star is not evident on the DSS, but you can clearly see it on the SDSS, including its diffraction spikes. NGC 1265 supposedly has a V mag ~12, but I'm guessing that includes the star, and the glow of IC 312 at V = 13.4 was more obvious to me."


Corwin checked Bigourdan's records and found he misplaced his offset star by 8'.  Once corrected, his offset points to IC 312!  Although the 8 arcminute error is unexplained, Corwin concludes "it is clear that Bigiourdan discovered IC 312 and not UGC 2651."  Although he has updated his files to this identification, it will be difficult to change other databases and the literature on the Perseus galaxy cluster.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1269 = h2518 on 1 Nov 1836, and logged "vB; R; glbM; 15"."  On the same sweep he found NGC 1291 = h2521 and strangely he recorded identical declinations and almost identical descriptions!  Could he have reobserved the same object unknowingly?  In MN, Vol 62, p469, Innes comments "not visible in the 7-inch [at the Cape of Good Hope].  This is perhaps the same as NGC 1291, observed by John Herschel on the same night.  JH gives for the latter exactly the same declination and description as for h2518."  Pietro Baracchi also searched for NGC 1269 unsuccessfully with the Great Melbourne Telescope on 16 Feb 1888.

But Harold Corwin equates IC 1907 with NGC 1278 (see that number). Thomson has a long discussion on the identify of IC 1907 in his IC survey.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1275 = H II-603 = h293 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 614) and recorded "pretty bright, stellar [nebula], or a pretty considerable star with a small, vF chevelure."  William's position was 1.5' too far south.  John Herschel made a single observation on 18 Sep 1828 (sweep 182) and measured an accurate position. NGC 1275 was observed by Lord Rosse's assistant Johnstone Stoney on 16 Dec 1848.  He noted "A multitude of nebs. knots in the neighborhood, principally preceding; counted 15; many more."


Heinrich d'Arrest observed the cluster on 14 Feb 1863 (discovering NGC 1267, 1268, 1270, 1272, 1273 and 1278) and described NGC 1275 as a "nebula duplex", the second component being NGC 1278 about 3' NE, so d'Arrest was the first to observe NGC 1278.  But he wasn't sure which of the two nebulae was NGC 1275 (H. II-603), so reported his observation of NGC 1275 as new and noted for NGC 1278: "II 603? [h]293?".  John Herschel credited d'Arrest with the discovery of GC 675 (later NGC 1278), but Dreyer thought WH discovered NGC 1278 and he mistakenly assigned d'Arrest's discovery to NGC 1275.  Steinicke agrees (personal e-mail) that Dreyer reversed the discovery credits and descriptions for NGC 1275 and NGC 1278 in the NGC and concludes:

NGC 1275 = II 603 = h 293 = GC 674, discovered by WH on 17 Oct 1786 and observed by d'Arrest on 14 Feb 1863.

NGC 1278 = GC 675, discovered by d'Arrest on 14 Feb 1863 and independently by Bigourdan on 22 Oct 1884 (IC 1907).


NGC 1275 contains a Sy2 nucleus and is one of the 6 original galaxies studied by Seyfert in his seminal 1943 paper "Nuclear Emission in Spiral Nebulae".  It is a powerful radio source (Perseus A)

24" (2/13/18): at 375x; fairly faint, fairly small, round, 25" diameter, weak concentration with a slightly brighter core.  In the central core of the Perseus galaxy cluster 2.8' NNE of NGC 1273 and 3.9' WNW of NGC 1278.


17.5" (12/3/88): very faint, very small, oval.  Located in the central core of AGC 426 on a line with NGC 1277 and NGC 1278 2' SE.


J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 1276 on 12 Dec 1876 while measured positions within the cluster.  From NGC 1278, his micrometric offset is 291" in PA 352.3? (or 3.5 seconds of RA west and 4.8' north).  There is no galaxy close to this offset, but at 4.7' separation in PA 353? is a 15" pair of stars that Corwin identifies as NGC 1276.  I'm surprised Dreyer didn't resolve this pair, though perhaps he thought one component was nebulous.


Malcolm Thomson suggested PGC 12430 as a possible match though the offsets are 6 seconds of RA west of NGC 1278 and only 2' N.  Karl Reinmuth stated in his 1926 monograph, "not found [on a Heidelberg plate] in Dreyer's place; perhaps 1.6' nnp of NGC 1277."  Reinmuth also refers to PGC 12430, but no simple error in Dreyer's offsets lands of this galaxy. RNGC also appears to identify PGC 12430 as NGC 1276.

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 1277 on 4 Dec 1875.  Dreyer independently found the galaxy a year later on 12 Dec 1876 and both observations are included in Dreyer's GC Supplement (5304 = 5305).  Dreyer equated the GC entries in the NGC.


Lewis Swift found this galaxy again on 14 Sep 1888 and reported it as new as the 32nd nebula in his 8th list, writing "eeeF; vS; R; close D[ouble] with 1276; M[iddle] of 3 in line; 1271, 73, 76, 78 in field".  His position is within 1' of NGC 1277 and the description applies, except it forms a close double with NGC 1278.  Dreyer didn't assign an IC designation to Sw. VIII-32, apparently correctly deciding it was a duplicate.  Unfortunately, Sw. VIII-31 didn't receive an IC designation either, although it applies to PGC 12430 (described as "one of 3 in a line").

II-603 and h293 should apply to NGC 1275 instead, as well as the description "pB, pS, R, bM".  Guillaume Bigourdan independently found this galaxy on 22 Oct 1884 and reported it in his 4th Comptes Rendus list as Big. 375 (later IC 1907).  Both d'Arrest and Bigourdan missed nearby NGC 1277.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1290 = LM 1-101 (along with NGC 1295 = LM 1-102) in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA) but 1.2 tmin of RA east is PGC 12395.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes).

25" (3/31/19 - OzSky): at 244x; extremely bright, large, elongated 4:3 NNW-SSE, ~3.5'x2.7', very bright core with an intense nucleus.  A mag 12.2 star is is superimposed at the N edge 1.7' from center and a second very faint star is superimposed in the halo on the south side.  The huge outer ring was not noticed.


17.5" (8/31/86): very bright, fairly large, contains a very bright, large core.  A mag 12 star is just off the north end 1.7' from the center.  Mag 8 SAO 216239 lies 11' SSW.  Viewed at only 10? elevation.


13.1" (10/10/86): very bright, moderately large, round, very bright core, almost stellar nucleus, large faint halo.  A star is involved on the north side.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1291 = D 487 = h2521 on 2 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta and recorded "a pretty bright round nebula, about 1.5' diameter, very bright and condensed to the centre, and very faint at the margin; with a very small star about 1' north, but not involved.".  His position is 4' too far ESE.  John Herschel observed this galaxy on 1 Nov 1836 and also catalogued h2518 (later NGC 1269).  The declination and descriptions are identical for his two entries, but differ by 2.6 minutes of time.  Clearly, Herschel was confused and recorded the object twice.  So, NGC 1269 = NGC 1291.


On a second sweep Herschel described the galaxy as "Globular; vB, R, 1st gradually, then suddenly very mbM; r, mottled, but not resolved.", so Dreyer identified this galaxy as a globular in the NGC description.  In a 1908 paper in Annals of the Harvard College Observatory, Solon Bailey expressed his doubt on the object's nature: "This object is given as a globular cluster in the NGC.  This appears probable, although it is not resolved on the [24"] Bruce plates [at Arequipa]."  He later included it in a list of uncertain or not probable globular star cluster.


Based on the photographs taken 30-inch reflector at the Cordoba observatory in Argentina, Charles Perrine first described the large outer ring in 1922 as "about one and one-half turns of a helix, the doubled portion (showing two streams) being to the north of the nuclear portion of the nebula.  The diameter of the helix is about 7'."

48" (10/25/14 and 10/29/16): the northern spiral arm is brightest and thickest in the 1' section, oriented SW-NE, where it attaches to the bar.  At 375x and 488x at least three knots (HII complexes) were clearly resolved along this region.  The brightest knot is on the southwest end (close to the end of the bar) and appears as a very faint, small, elongated glow, ~12"x8".  This HII complex contains NGC 1300:[H69] 16/19 from Paul Hodge's 1969 "HII Regions in Twenty Nearby Galaxies" (ApJS, 18, 73).  [H69] 15, the next brightest knot, is 0.3' NE and appeared very faint and small, ~8" diameter.  Finally, [H69] 14, the faintest knot, is near the northeast end of this arm segment (~15" NE of [H69] 15) and is extremely faint and small, 6" diameter.  The northern arm appears to fade out as it extends east (north of the core) but reappears along the eastern end of the arm.


The root of the southern arm at the east end of the bar is brighter and thicker, but no HII regions were resolved.  The long southern arm could be traced the full length (nearly 4') sweeping west and arcing north on its western half. A small, weak knot is at the very tip, which is 2.5' W of center (on line with the bar).


30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): beautiful classic barred spiral at 303x!  A prominent 3' bar runs WNW-ESE and contains a very bright, roundish 1' core that gradually brightens to the center.  An easily visible arm is attached at the east end of the bar.  It hooks sharply to the west on the south side, gradually curling towards the north.  The arm has a fairly even surface brightness except where is attaches to the bar in a brighter, thicker section.  It ends nearly due west of the core [2.2' from center].  An opposing arm is attached at the west end of the bar and is brightest initially along a clumpy section (containing at least 2 resolved knots) angling from southwest to northeast.  The central section of the northern arm (directly north of the core) has a very low surface brightness but it brightens in a thin section near the east end. The two main arms extend at least 4.5'x3' ~E-W


48" (10/25/11): this prototype barred spiral was mesmerizing at 375x.  Running roughly E-W through the center is a long bright bar, ~3' in length.  The center is sharply concentrated with an intensely bright 1' core that continues to increase to a stellar nucleus.  At the west end of the bar, a fairly bright arm emerges and hooks back dramatically to the east (counterclockwise) to the north of the bar and continues to the northeast end of the galaxy.  The arm is brightest in a thick arc, oriented SW-NE, where it attaches to the bar.  The central section of the arm to the north of the core is slightly fainter and then brightens slightly on its northeast end.  A mag 15.5-16 star is superimposed in the gap between this arm and the core, 45" NE of center.  The second arm emerges at the east end of the bar and is brightest initially in a fairly thick arc extending counterclockwise to the southwest.  This arm is slightly more separated from the core as it gracefully curves to the southwest side of the galaxy.  The two main arms increase the overall size of the galaxy to 5'x3' WNW-ESE.


17.5" (8/31/86): fairly bright, elongated ~E-W, bright core, stellar nucleus.  A spiral arm is visible at the west end of the central bar curving to the north.  NGC 1297 lies 20' NNW.


8" (10/13/81): faint, fairly large, elongated, low surface brightness, diffuse.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1300 = h2522 on 11 Dec 1835, recording "B; vL; 1st very gradually then pretty suddenly vmbM; 3' l; 2' b; mE. (N.B. These dimensions can only refer to the brighter portions.)" His second descriptions reads: "pF, vL; 1st gradually then pretty suddenly bM to a F nucleus; mE 8' or 10' l, 2' b.".  Herschel's position (2 observations) is accurate but in the GC he accidentally placed GC 689 = NGC 1300 one degree too far south  Barnard caught this error (Sidereal Messenger 4, p125) and Dreyer corrected the position while compiling the NGC.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright, fairly large, very elongated 7:2 SW-NE, 2.2'x0.6', broad concentration with a large, brighter core but no distinct nucleus.  Located 9.5' S of mag 8.4 HD 20916.  Member of the Dorado Group.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1311 = h2525 on 24 Dec 1837, recording it as "F, mE in position 37.3 degrees; gbM, 2' long, 15 arcseconds broad.".  His position and description is accurate.  NGC 1311 and NGC 1356 are included in a list of 46 nebulae recorded on two plates made with the Bruce telescope in October 1898 by DeLisle Stewart (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1899HarCi..38....1P).

Sidney Coolidge discovered NGC 1312 = HN 23 on 16 Dec 1859 with the 15-inch refractor of Harvard College Observatory during the Zone Survey of equatorial stars.  He simply noted "a circular nebulosity", but at his exact position is a double star at 03 23 41.7 +01 11 05 (J2000).  Bigourdan was unable to find this object and Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, mentions "perhaps *, ef * ssf vnr."  RNGC, CGCG, UGC, MCG and RC3 all misidentify UGC 2711 as NGC 1312.  See Corwin's notes.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was the first object I took a look at using the 24" f/3.7 as it was the brightest galaxy I had yet to observe.  I was amazed to find a striking, two-armed barred spiral with obvious bright HII knots in the arms!  At 200x the main body of the galaxy appeared as a bright oval or wide bar ~4.5'x3.5' oriented SSW-NNE with a central bulge.  A relatively short spiral arm emerges from the south-southwest end and hooks towards the northwest.  Embedded with this extension is [PES80] 5/6, a brighter elongated HII knot, ~30"x20".  A mag 15 star is west of the northwest end of this arm.


Just east of the north-northeast end of the main bar is [PES80] 1, another brighter HII knot, ~30"x15" and oriented E-W.  A faint star (or stellar knot) is less than 1' NW.  This bright HII region is embedded in a diffuse arm that curves gently east-southeast from the north end of the bar.  After the bright knot, this extension dims but ends at [PES80] 3, a third bright knot ~15" diameter, which is isolated the end of this arm (nearly due east of the core).  The HII designations are from the 1980 study by Page, Edmunds and Smith in MNRAS, 193, 219.


NGC 1313A = ESO 83-1, located 16' SE, appeared as a fairly small, thin edge-on oriented 4:1 SSW-NNE, ~0.6'x0.15'.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1313 = D 206 = h2528 on 27 Sep 1826, describing "a faint ill-defined nebula, rather extended in the direction of the meridian, with several exceedingly minute stars in it."  John Herschel only observed this bright galaxy on one sweep and logged "pB, irreg R or lE, vL, vgbM, resolvable, 3'."


Joseph Turner observed and sketched the galaxy on 13 Nov 1878 with the 48-inch Melbourne Telescope (p.194 of logbook).  He sketched the central bar oriented N-S, broader on the south end and tapering on the east end.  Just north of end of the "bar" he sketched a small knot, probably a HII region.  A small elongated patch was seen just east of the north end of the bar, oriented NW-SE (part of the eastern spiral arm).  A symmetric elongated patch was shown just west of the south end, also oriented NW-SE (this is the brightest section of the western arm).


Pietro Baracchi also observed the galaxy on 4 Dec 1885 and wrote, "pB, vL, irregular, pmbM,. This object is complicated.  It seems to have appendages not quite detached from the main body but alomost separated from it by two very faint portions which seem at first void of nebula, giving a first impression of three detached nebulae, the middle of which is large, elongated due N and S and gpmbM and the other two, small very faint patches one north and one south of the middle one.  The north one pretty much brighter than the south one - but these three individualities are connected by extremely fant nebulous intervals.  Another extremely faint pretty large round flat object south-preceding [NGC 1313].  I believe this is a new nebula." His sketch includes this object as a diffuse patch labeled as "New?" on the southwest side. At his position is the HII complex [PES80] 8, which is situated between the central part of the galaxy and a mag 10 star 7.6' SW of center. [PES80] 1 is also shown on the sketch as a brighter patch on the NE end of the galaxy.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1314 = LM 2-367 on 18 Jan 1887 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 16.0, 2.0' diameter, E 170?, mag 10 star with an eF nebula south, *16 in middle?"  There is nothing at his position but 1.1 tmin of RA west is MCG -01-09-033 = PGC 12650, a low surface brightness, face-on spiral, about 1.5' diameter and the RNGC identifies NGC 1314 = PGC 12650.

8" (9/25/81): bright, round, slightly elongated, small bright core.  Forms a pair with NGC 1317 7' N.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1316 = D 548 = h2527 on 2 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta and described "a rather bright, round nebula, about 1.5' diameter, gradually condensed to the centre."  He made two observations and his published position was pretty poor -- nearly 20' SE of the galaxy.  Dunlop discovered six members of the Fornax cluster, though most (15) were found by John Herschel.  Herschel first observed the galaxy on 22 Oct 1835 and noted "vB; pL; lE; vsvmbM, to a nucleus 2" in diameter." On his second sweep he logged "vB; vL; 4' diameter; 1st gradually, then very suddenly very much brighter towards the middle to a stellar ncl"


NGC 1316 is the brightest member of the Fornax cluster and is also known as Fornax A, one of the closest and most famous radio sources in the southern hemisphere.  Its radio lobes extend several degrees of sky.  Arp classified it as a disturbed galaxy with interior absorption -- like Centaurus A, NGC 1316 contains an extensive system of dust filaments as well as low surface brightness shells and tidal tails, indicating a likely merger.  Four supernovae have exploded since 1980.

This was the last object he discovered and his position is ~15' ENE of center.  JH first observed the galaxy on 22 Oct 1835 and noted "pB, S, R, psbM." His second sweep he recorded it as "pB, pL, 1' diameter; a miniature of the last neb. of this sweep."  Julius Schmidt independently found the galaxy on 19 Jan 1865 and thought it was new, because JH made an typo of 20 degrees in NPD for h2529 in the CGH catalogue.  JH corrected the NPD in the addendum of the catalogue, but apparently Schmidt didn't check.

Julius Schmidt found NGC 1318 on 19 Jan 1865 with the 6.2-inch refractor at the Athens Observatory in his survey of the Fornax Cluster (nebula "a" in his table).  His position is almost identical to NGC 1317 = h2529.  Schmidt assumed this nebula was "new" in his 1876 paper since he was working from John Herschel's Cape Catalogue.  In the original listing for h2529, Herschel made an typo of 20 degrees in NPD but he corrected this mistake in the addendum of the catalogue. Apparently Schmidt didn't check his correction list.  Dorothy Carlson and RNGC list this number as "Not Found".

The description reads, "suspected neb (or perhaps only a star) with a F* close sp."  It's possible this galaxy was found earlier by George Johnstone Stoney on 19 Dec  1848 and mentioned as a "* or nebula about 2 1/2' north of [NGC 1322].

William Herschel discovered NGC 1325 = H IV-77 = h2534 on 19 Dec 1799 (sweep 1091), describing "a star about 9 or 10m with a nebulous ray to the south-preceding side. The ray is about 1.5' long. The star may not be connected with it."  John Herschel described and sketched this galaxy from the Cape on 11 Nov 1835: "A complete telescopic comet; a perfect miniature of Halley's, only the tail is rather broader in proportion; mE; 90" l; the star at the head = 10 mag.  See fig 17, Pl VI."


Joseph Turner sketched the galaxy on 15 Nov 1875 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate II, figure 8 1/2).  He noted it appeared "much fainter than Herschel's sketch shows it - It seems to be much altered since he observed it."  Instead of the tip of the galaxy at the brighter star (called "a perfect miniature of Halley's" by Herschel), Turner sketched a thin section of the galaxy, skirting around the start and extending further northeast.

His description simply includes a magnitude of 16.3 for the nucleus, and the comment "neb?".  Southern Galaxy Catalogue, ESO-LV, RC3 and Uranometria 2000 (2nd edition) identify NGC 1327 = ESO 481-026 at 03 25 23.2 -25 40 46 (2000).

ESO/Uppsala identifies a pair of stars with a wider third star about 8' NW of this galaxy as possibly NGC 1327, although they are too bright to be Stone's intended object.  This identification probably derives from the NGC Correction list at Harvard College Observatory "3 vF st close together, no neb" (from DeLisle Stewart and repeated in IC 2).   RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent and it is missing from the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas.  See my RNGC Corrections #6 and Corwin's notes.

13.1" (10/10/86): bright, moderately large, very bright core, edge-on 4:1 NW-SE, 2.4'x0.6'.  A faint mag 14-14.5 star is just southwest of the core.  Forms a pair with NGC 1331 = IC 324 2.8' SE (collinear with the major axis).  NGC 1332 is the brightest in a group with NGC 1315, NGC 1319, NGC 1325, NGC 1331 and Holmberg VI (NGC 1325A).


8" (12/6/80): fairly bright, fairly small, elongated NW-SE, bright core, diffuse halo.  NGC 1331 not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1332 = H I-60 on 9 Dec 1784 (sweep 331) and logged "vB, S, lE, mbM."  On 19 Dec 1799 (sweep 1091) he recorded "Two [along with NGC 1331], the 1st [NGC 1332] vB, SBNcl with faint branches from np to sf."  The position of NGC 1331 is too far west in the NGC, so the pair is out of RA order.


Joseph Turner sketched the pair on 26 Nov 1875 with the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate II, figure 9) as well as Pietro Baracchi on 7 Jan 1885.

18" (1/20/07): fairly large, striking reflection nebula with a 10th magnitude star at the NE end.  The nebula curves to the southwest ending with a 1' brighter knot with very faint star involved near its edge.  A couple of mag 14 stars are superimposed between the mag 10 star and the knot.  The total size is roughly 7'x4'.  The surrounding region (particularly to the north) is nearly starless and clearly affected by dust.  This region has a number of Herbig-Haro objects and is an active star formation region.


17.5" (2/9/02): bright, interesting reflection nebula at 140x.  Apparently illuminated by a mag 10 star oddly offset at the NE end of the glow.  The appearance is irregular; extending ~10'x6' SW-NE in the general direction of a mag 10 star 11' SW.  The SW extension contains a couple of faint mag 14 stars and ends at a small, brighter knot that appears to surround a very faint star or stars.  The field is oddly void of faint stars and there is a large starless region to the north (this is the dark nebula Barnard 2).


17.5" (12/8/90): fairly bright reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10 star that is offset to the northeast side of the nebula.  This is a large object, about 10'x6' and elongated SW-NE.  There is a bright knot in the southwest end.  Two or three 15th magnitude stars are superimposed.


13.1" (11/29/86): fairly bright nebula, large, extends SSW of a mag 9.5 star, oval, slightly brighter at the south edge.


Eduard Sch?nfeld discovered NGC 1333 = Au 17 on 31 Dec 1855 with a 3-inch Fraunhofer refractor at Bonn Observatory, while measuring stars for the BD catalogue (NGC 1333 received the number BD +30? 548).  He noted it as a nebulous star.  The discovery was not announced until 1862 in AN 1391 and Auwers included it the same year as #17 in his "Verzeichnis neuer Nebelflecke" (list of new nebulae).  In the meantime Horace Tuttle independently discovered the object on 5 Feb 1859 with a 3-inch comet-seeker and Bond (director of Harvard College) announced it as new in 1859MNRAS..19..224B: "it follows a star of the 9-10 mag by 6 seconds, and is 2' north of it.  It is barely visible in a telescope of 3 in aperture."


In September 1862 d'Arrest noted it was as faint as a Herschel nebula of third class with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen, but since Tuttle's (independent) discovery was made using a 3-inch scope, he thought it might be a variable nebula (a popular topic among visual observers).  Winnecke also took the view that it "must be a new one" as it was listed neither in the Slough catalogue nor Auwers' lists.  Based on all the observations, Sch?nfeld reached the conclusion this case was a "...striking example of how the visibility of very faint, large diffuse nebulae depends on the magnification, air transparency and adaptation to the dark of the eye, so that, compared with ordinary fixed stars, aperture takes a back seat."  In 1914 Barnard photographed the region at Yerkes Observatory and noted the nebula appeared "roundish and not symmetrical with respect to the star - its center seems to be several minutes to the south."  Summarized from Harold Corwin's identification notes and Steinicke's "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters".

Samuel Hunter, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 1355 on 27 Dec 1861.  His sketch clearly shows NGC 1355 labeled as Alpha, along with NGC 1358 (close to a double star).  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered NGC 1355 on 8 Oct 1864 while observing nearby NGC 1358.  He was surprised this nebula was missed by WH and Rosse (unaware of Hunter's observation).  Dreyer made an observation at Birr Castle on 6 Nov 1877 and later realized that Alpha was d'Arrest's "nova".  Nevertheless, he credited d'Arrest and not LdR with the discovery in the GC Supplement and NGC.

This showpiece planetary is clearly asymmetric and notably brighter on the NNE side in a sector extending from the center and fanning out to the north.  This brighter region is irregular in surface brightness and slightly dims before brightening along the NNE rim.  The south side is slightly fainter and contains a weaker arc or lane.


18" (1/1/08): at 115x; this unusual planetary is a huge oval or irregular egg-shape, ~6'x4', oriented SSW-NNE (PA ~30?) surrounding a very bright mag 11 central star.  Excellent contrast with an OIII filter as it really brings out its asymmetric structure.  The planetary is noticeably brighter in a fan-shaped wedge spreading out from the central star to the north.  At times the northeast rim appeared a bit clumpy.  The fainter south side has a slightly darker lane extending to the southeast.


17.5" (11/17/01): At 100x with OIII filter, this huge planetary appears a very large oval 3:2 or 4:3 SSW-NNE, ~6'x4.5' with a striking central star.  Appears clearly brighter on the north side of the central star in a section defined by a triangular wedge with apex at the central star.  The nebulosity dims a bit on the west side as well as the south.

Lewis Swift probably discovered NGC 1360 in 1859 with his 4.5-inch comet-seeker (discovery not published until 1885, though).  Wilhelm Tempel independently discovered it on 9 Oct 1861, along with NGC 1398, using his personal 4-inch Steinheil refractor from Marseille, but he didn't publish his observation either.  Friedrich August Winnecke then found it again in Jan 1868 with his 3.8-inch comet-seeker, estimating a diameter of 10', as well as Eugen Block on 18 Oct 1879 (AN 2293).  Dreyer credited Winnecke with the discovery in the GC Supplement (5315).  Afterwards, Tempel published his find in 1882, claiming an earlier discovery.


Finally, in the Mar 1885 issue of "The Sidereal Messenger: A Monthly Review of Astronomy" Swift reported that "in 1859 while searching in Eridanus for comets I ran upon the most conspicuous nebulous star visible from this latitude - a 7th magnitude star nearly in the center of a bright nebulosity.  As both were so bright, I, of course, supposed they were well known.  Not until five years since was I aware that this wonderful object was not in the G.C."  Dreyer credited Swift (his earliest discovery) and Winnecke in the NGC.  So, NGC 1360 was independently "discovered" by four observers, the most (along with NGC 6364 and 7422) for any NGC number, according to Wolfgang Steinicke.  Robert Innes found it again on 8 Dec 1909 and reported it as "easily seen in the 2-inch finder as in the 9-inch" (Union Observatory, Johannesburg).  He noted it was oval nebula with the longer axis SW-NE, but apparently wasn't realize of the previous discoveries.


This is one the brightest objects missed by the Herschels as well as by John Dunlop.  In 1914, Hardcastle classified NGC 1360 as a spindle-shaped nebula. The following year, Knox-Shaw at the Helwan Observatory reported it wasn't a spindle but was "probably like the Owl", based on a photograph taken with the Reynolds reflector.  Minkowski first classified it as definitely a planetary in 1946. A star was incorrectly plotted at the position on the Uranometria 2000 Atlas (first edition) because the CoD and CPD catalogue (used as a source for the U2000) included the central star.

48" (10/22/11): stunning view of this huge, barred spiral with the full extent of the long, graceful arms clearly visible and a great deal of structure. The very bright bar runs nearly 3' WSW-ENE and contains an extremely bright core that increases to a striking knotty nucleus that is sliced by a dust lane running SW to NE.  The dust lane creates a mini spiral in the center with a bright elongated section south of the lane that has an "arm" attached at its northeast end that curls to the southwest.  The section of the nucleus north of the lane appears as a small but brighter arm, gently curving from SW to NE.


The main northern spiral arm is attached at the west end of the bar and has a bright, mottled "knot" as it emerges from the bar and heads north-northeast.  This knot contains the HII regions #23-25 from Paul Hodge's 1969 "HII Regions in Twenty Nearby Galaxies" (ApJS, 18, 73).  It was also the site of SN 2001du, a supernova discovered visually by Robert Evans.  This arm dims a bit and then brightens along a 1' strip (containing #19) just northwest of a superimposed mag 13.5 star.  The arm then dims significantly but can be easily traced a total length of 6.5', ending just southeast of a mag 13.5-14 star.


The main southern arm emerges on the east-northeast end of the bar as a brighter patch or OB association that contains #2-3, matching the west end.  A group of stars is just beyond this patch to the east.  The arm extends ~6.5' SW and is bordered by several stars; a mag 14.5 star is on the south edge before the middle of the arm, a mag 16 star 1.3' due south of this star and two mag 15/16 stars are on the inside (northern edge) beyond the middle of the arm. A very small, very faint knot is near the southwest tip of the arm.  The arm dims significantly at this point but bends and continues another 2' NW.


24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): viewed SN2012fr, a type Ia supernova, as a mag 12 star situated just 2" west and 52" north of the center of NGC 1365.


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the best visual barred spiral in the sky and although it was only at 33? elevation (well past the meridian), the view was stunning at 200x with its long sweeping arms making a slashing cosmic "Z" in the eyepiece.  I was also surprised by the structure in the fairly small, extremely bright core that is embedded in the 3' E-W bar.  On the north edge of the mottled core, a very short, hooking appendage extended towards the northeast with a fainter counterpart on the southwest end.  This gave the small core the appearance of a tiny barred spiral!  At the west end of the bar a bright arm emerges, dramatically sweeping back to the NNE (sharp 110? angle) beyond a mag 13 star that is situated near the 1/3 mark of its total length.  The counterpart on the east end of the bar shoots to the southwest, reaching a faint star at its end.  The total distance between the tips of the arms is roughly 10'.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 127x and 212x, NGC 1365 appeared as an amazing two-armed barred spiral, similar to the photographic appearance.  The core is a quite bright, bulging oval embedded in a larger bar oriented ~E-W.  Attached at opposite ends of the bar are two long, graceful arms that extend quite a distance and are nearly straight.  The arm attached on the west side of the bar wraps around a mag 12.5 star about 1' NW of the core and extends well beyond towards the NNE.  The opposite arm attached on the following end is slightly fainter and shoots towards the SSW.  The tips of the outer arms dramatically increase the total size of the galaxy.


18" (12/30/08): although a pale imitation of the view from Australia, with careful viewing at 175x the spiral arm attached at the west end of the central bar was faintly visible sweeping to the NNE for ~3' in length.  The counterpart on the SE side was not seen.


13.1" (12/22/84): bright, elongated core, large, 3' diameter, very diffuse outer halo.  Member of the Fornax I cluster.


8" (1/1/84): fairly bright, fairly large, bright core, diffuse halo, broad concentration.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1365 = D 562 = h2552 on 2 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta and described "a pretty large faint round nebula, about 3 1/2' diameter, gradual slight condensation to the centre, very faint at the margin."  He made two observations though his published position is off by 10 tmin in RA.  By examining Dunlop's original papers, Glen Cozens found a copying error and Dunlop's handwritten position falls ~8' E of NGC 1365.


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 1365 on 28 Nov 1837 and described "A very remarkable nebula. A decided link between the nebula M 51 and M 27. Centre very bright; somewhat extended; gradually very much brighter to the middle; a 13th magnitude star near the edge of the halo involved. The area of the halo very faint; general position of the longer axis 20.8 degrees. whole breadth = 3'. See Pl. IV. fig. 1."  The next night he made a second observation and logged "very bright, extended, resolvable nucleus; or has 2 or 3 stars involved; the preceding Arc is the brighter. I think the oval is in some degree filled up to the south."  Based on his size estimate, JH may have only observed the central region. The NGC attributes JH with the discovery.


Joseph Turner observed and sketched a pair of dramatic spiral arms, central bar and core as a "Z" shaped figure using the 48-inch Great Melbourne Telescope on 2 Dec 1875 (unpublished lithograph plate II, figure 10), as well as Albert Le Sueur on 30 Jan 1870 (plate VII, figure 84).

This is a relatively bright member of the Fornax I cluster that was missed by John Herschel.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC due to a poor position by Julius Schmidt.


Julius Schmidt discovered NGC 1369 on 19 Jan 1865 with the 6.2" refractor at the Athens Observatory during his survey on the Fornax Cluster (nebula "b" in his table).  There is nothing at his position, which is 9.4' SE of NGC 1365.  Interestingly, NGC 1365 is the previous entry in his table (AN 2097, p137) and that position is very accurate.

Harold Corwin found that if Schmidt made 3 minute error in RA for both objects (change 27 to 30), then NGC 1369 = ESO 358-034 = PGC 13330 and the bright star (4.5' SE) is mag 7.2 HD 22621.


This galaxy was listed in a table of new nebulae found between 1909-11 at the Helwan Observatory, but Knox-Shaw remarked that it was "possibly identical with [NGC] 1369."   ESO-LV (surface photometry catalogue) and RC3 identify NGC 1369 = ESO 358-034 but the ESO-Uppsala catalogue and MCG don't label this galaxy as NGC 1369. The RNGC calls this number nonexistent.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1370 = H III-559 = H III-960 = h2554 on 20 Sep 1786 (sweep 597) and logged III 559 as "3 vS stars in a line, with vF nebulosity.  On 19 Dec 1799 (sweep 1091) he noted III 960 as "vF, vS, 300 confirmed it."  His position on both sweeps are pretty close to ESO 548-048 and clearly his first description (III-559) mentioning "3 vS stars in a line" applies to this galaxy (one of the "stars" is the nucleus).  In the CGH catalogue, JH assigned the first H-designation to h2551 = NGC 1362 and the second to h2554 = NGC 1370.  Auwers has a note to III 559, commenting on the large discrepancy in position with h2551 (87 seconds in RA and 4' in Dec).  In the GC, JH decided to reverse the assignment of his father's numbers and Dreyer copied this in the NGC.  But both observations refer to NGC 1370.  JH made 3 observations, recording on 11 Dec 1835, "vF; R; situated exactly between 2 stars 14th mag."

Ormond Stone independently found the galaxy in 1886 and recorded LM 1-106 as "mag 13.0 [bright], *9, nf 5.0'."  His rough position is a good match with H II-262 = NGC 1371 and his comment about the nearby star clinches the equivalence.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1373 = h2556 on 29 Nov 1837 and recorded "eF, vS, the preceding of three [with NGC 1374 and 1375]."  His position is quite poor and lands at the southwest edge of NGC 1374, so clearly there was some problem with the observation.  When Julius Schmidt observed the field he measured an accurate position for NGC 1374, but was unsure of its identification and has no measurement for NGC 1373.  Still, there are only three galaxies here, and Herschel's description is appropriate for ESO 358-021 = PGC 13252.  Harold Knox-Shaw found this galaxy again on a photograph taken with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector between 1912-14 at the Helwan Observatory and reported it as new in the 1915 observatory bulletin.

The arm faded and was less defined as it curled clockwise and spread west on the north end of the halo.  The south portion of the halo was faint overall (due to dust) but displayed a semi-circular outline due to the very low surface brightness southern arm.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1392 = Sw. VI-15 on 13 Feb 1887, along with Sw. VI-14, and recorded "vF; pS; R."  There is nothing at his position, though Sw. VI-15 was placed ~4.5' N of brighter VI-14.  Swift has a long note at the end of his 6th list about VI-14 and VI-15. He assumed VI-14 referred to the "Great Southern Comet" 1887-I, though he found it 3? south of the predicted place. At the end of his paper, H.C.F. Kreutz remarked that the most recent orbital calculations placed Swift's nebula 38 minutes of RA east and 4? south of the position of the comet, so they were likely not related.  More of the story which follows, is gleaned from Gary Kronk's book on Lewis Swift and Harold Corwin's IC identification notes.


In the following volume of Astronomische Nachrichten (AN 118, 203), Swift wrote (17 Dec) "I have made two unsuccessful attempts to refind the two objects one of which I thought was very probably Comet 1887-I.  The seeing on both occasions were fairly good but not equal that when seen which was exceptionally fine.  I am therefore not surprised that the faintest one was not seen as it was a very faint object and though so near the suspected comet was not noticed for some little time.  In fact I begin to fear I shall never see the faint one again in consequence of an increased number of electric street lights south of and not far from the observatory."


Barnard also searched for Swift's nebulae and reported on 19 November (AN 118, 173) he strongly suspected Swift's positions were erroneous as he searched for the comet unsuccessfully on 11 and 12 February and would have picked up a brighter object when he covered Swift's position.  After later receiving a letter from Swift, he specifically searched for the nebulae again on the 15th of November with a 6.4-inch refractor (at Vanderbilt) and found nothing at Swift's position.  But expanding his search area he found two nebulae with the same relative positions and appropriate descriptions that "seems to me that these are Swift's objects".   A note was added by A. Krueger, AN's editor, that based on Barnard's position, the two nebulae are GC 697 and 698 (= NGC 1316 and 1317).  This would imply Swift made a very large error of 15 minutes of time in RA (too far east), but otherwise these galaxies are a good match with Swift's description and relative positions!


Swift was apparently quite upset by Barnard's remarks and responded in the AN 118 note (5 Jan 1888) that the previous night he observed Barnard's nebulae and "they bear about as much resemblance to mine as the Orion nebula does to the Andromeda nebula. I am now more thoroughly convinced that the suspected object was a comet than I was at first and highly probably was comet 1887 I."   Despite Swift's comments, the most likely conclusion is NGC 1392 = NGC 1317 and Sw. VI-14 = NGC 1316.


ESO misidentifies ESO 358-040 (1? north of Swift's position) as NGC 1392.  RNGC misidentifies ESO 358-034 (53' SSE of Swift's position) as NGC 1392.

Note: this identification is very unlikely and the number should probably be classified as "lost".


Julius Schmidt discovered NGC 1396 on 19 Jan 1865 with the 6.2-inch refractor at the Athens Observatory during his survey of the Fornax Cluster (nebula "i" in his table).  There is nothing at his position of 03 38 01 -35 40 17 (2000), and the RNGC classifies NGC 1396 as nonexistent.  The Southern Galaxy Catalogue and RC3, though, identify PGC 13398 as NGC 1396.  This galaxy is 14' due north of Schmidt's location and places NGC 1396 just 5' WNW of the bright elliptical NGC 1399.


But I'm not convinced that Schmidt could have picked up this galaxy with a 6" refractor as it was extremely faint in my 18-inch.  Harold Corwin took another look at the SGC galaxy in September 2017 and is now also skeptical this is the object seen by Schmidt.  See Harold Corwin's historical notes and my RNGC Corrections #6.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 1398, along with an independent discovery of NGC 1360, on 9 Oct 1861 using his personal 4" Steinheil refractor from Marseille.  Tempel didn't announce the discovery until May 1882 and in the meantime it was independently found by Friedrich August Winnecke on 17 Dec 1868 with a 4.5" refractor at Karlsruhe and Eugen Block (AN 2287) on 18 Oct 1879 with a 4" refractor at Odessa.  This is the brightest galaxy discovered by Tempel (V = 9.7) and the most southerly.


Based on plates taken at the Helwan observatory in 1927-31, NGC 1398 was described as an "oval ring 5' diameter, surrounding a faint, disc 1.5' diameter with a vB central almost stellar ncl, 1/2' with a pF axis E 10?."

John Herschel discovered NGC 1411 = h2573 on 24 Oct 1835 and recorded "B, R, vsvmbM, 20 arcsec."  His position is accurate.  Harold Corwin suggests Lewis Swift may have found this galaxy again on 3 Oct 1897 at Echo Mountain, but made an error in recording the RA of Sw. XII-44, with the RA 9 min too small (the dec matches).  If so, then NGC 1411 = IC 1943.  See Corwin's notes for IC 1943.

17.5" (1/12/02): moderately bright, moderately large, elongated nearly 2:1 NW-SE, 1.3'x0.7', bright core.  Situated in a group of three mag 11/12 stars with a mag 12 star 1.6' SE.  Located 38' SE of NGC 1398 in northeast Fornax.


John Herschel found NGC 1412 = h2574 on 20 Nov 1835 and recorded "F, S, E, gpmbM, 15"; has a * S.f. distance 2'."  There is nothing at his position and NGC 1412 was reported as not found on a 60 min exposure at the Helwan observatory (1935) or on Bruce 24-inch refractor plates from South Africa (Robert Baker, 1933).  As a result the RNGC classified the number as nonexistent.  But 40' due south of Herschel's position is ESO 482-029 = PGC 13520 and ESO-LV and RC3 identify this galaxy as NGC 1412.  ESO 482-029 is a good match in description; the galaxy is elongated NW-SE with a mag 12 star 1.6' SSE.  The poor declination probably resulted from a copying error.


Lewis Swift found this galaxy again on 26 Dec 1897, placed it 37 sec of RA too far west (declination matches) in discovery list XI-58 (later IC 1981). So, NGC 1412 = IC 1981.  ESO and MCG use only the IC designation.  Included in my RNGC Corrections #6 and Corwin's notes.

There are two stars "near following" this galaxy, but the wide double star is west-southwest, not northwest per Swift.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1429 = LM 2-381 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  He has two listings under this number.

The second object is listed at 0.5 min of RA east and described as mag 15.5, 0.3'x0.2', E 180? (N-S) with the note "second of 2".  There is only a single galaxy near his position, namely NGC 1424 (discovered earlier at Birr Castle), which better matches the second entry (elongated N-S).

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1430 = LM 2-380 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  He reported, "mag 15.4, 0.6'x0.4', E 20?, sbMN."  There is nothing at his position and no reasonable candidates showed up in a quick search of the surrounding fields.  Bigourdan was not able to recover this object and it was reported not found on Harvard plates taken with the Bruce astrograph in South Africa (Baker, 1937).


Harold Corwin identified this number with a mag 13.3 star near Leavenworth's position but a single star does not fit his description (0.6'x0.4' in PA 20?).  As a result, I had listed this object as lost.  But in Apr 2016 Yann Pothier suggested that NGC 1430 is a duplicate of NGC 1440.  The RA of NGC 1440 is 1.5 minutes further east (typical error in the Leander-McCormick observations) and the description is a fairly good match (except for the magnitude estimate).

Size 15'x15'


8" (12/28/16): at 124x (unfiltered): although all the bright stars in the Pleiades had scattered light halos, it appeared mag 3.9 Maia had a slightly more extensive halo and irregular halo than mag 3.7 Electra.  So, I am fairly confident this was due to the outer reflection nebulosity surrounding Maia.  The scattered light itself seemed about the same intensity around both stars.


Paul and Prosper Henry (brothers) discovered NGC 1432 on the first plate they took of the Pleiades on 16 Nov 1885 at Paris Observatory using the 33-cm astrograph. The plate showed nebulosity around Maia which they described "appears very clearly and has spiral form...it was impossible to see it in our telescopes."  The discovery was announced in AN 2702, though it didn't include an image of the nebula (first published in 1888).  This is the only object in the NGC discovered photographically!


Pickering noted on 21 Jan 1886 that he had already photographed the Pleiades on 3 Nov 1885 with an 8-inch lens and stated it only showed "certain irregularities...due merely to defects in the photographic process."  However, a comparison revealed that these "irregularities" included a patch west of Maia, pointing to the north, and a diffuse remnant near Merope pointing south.  As Pickering interpreted these as plate flaws, the discovery priority remains with Paul and Prosper Henry.  The first visual observation was made by Otto Struve on 5 Feb 1886 with the new 30-inch refractor at Pulkovo.  On 23 Feb 1886 he made another observation and sketch with the nebula stretching from Maia to the east.  E.E. Barnard also observed it visually in 1890.

I had a strong impression of extensions or the beginnings of two spiral arms (sketch made and verified); one arm begins at the west end and starts to curve towards the east on the south side while the other is symmetrically placed on the following end and hooks west on the north side.  On images these arms connect to form a perfect barred ring. A mag 12 star lies 2.8' SW of center, beyond the halo.


This barred spiral is the brightest member of the NGC 1433 group and part of the Dorado Cloud complex that includes NGC 1512, 1448, 1493 and 1411.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1433 = D 426 on 28 Sep 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector and described "a very faint nebula, about 1' diameter, rather elliptical in the parallel of the equator; with a brightish point or condensation of the nebulous matter, a little to the preceding side of the centre."  John Herschel first logged the galaxy on 14 Dec 1835 and recorded (h2580), "B, L, pmE, smbM; 100" long, 60" broad".   His second sweep noted "vB, L, mE, vsmbM to nucleus = 10th mag star."  Joseph Turner's sketch with the Great Melbourne Telescope on 10 Nov 1877, shows the thin bar running E-W with a well defined, bright nucleus. (p. 149 of his logbook).

NGC 1435 = Ced 19j = vdB 22 = Merope Nebula = Tempel's Nebula

03 46 10 +23 45 54; Tau

Size 30'x30'


24" (12/28/16): at 124x (unfiltered): the huge Merope Nebula was easily visible, roughly spanning 20' in a wedge or triangular shape with mag 4.2 Merope close to the northeast vertex.  The most well defined edge is clearly the eastern side as it extends N-S.  The edge passes close to a string of 7 stars oriented NNW-SSE, including two mag 10 stars and nearly reaches mag 8.1 HD 23512, which is 20' SSE of Merope.  Just before reaching this star the nebulosity clearly curves to the west and extends ~20' generally northwest, passing north of mag 9.0 HD 23326, though the border is slightly less defined.  At this point the edges of the nebulosity can be traced back east or ENE back to Merope, though the edge here is the least defined.  The surface brightness of the interior is irregular with some slightly brighter patches and weaker areas.


18" (1/26/11): at 73x (unfiltered), the Merope Nebula was immediately visible as a huge wedge-shape or comet-shaped glow with Merope near the focus on the northeast end and the nebula spreading out generally to the south and west.  The most striking feature of the nebula is the well-defined and approximately eastern edge oriented N-S that heads south from Merope, passing through a 1' pair of mag 10/11 stars as well as a 1' pair of mag 10/12.5 star.  The nebulosity can be traced a bit over 20' along this side.  On the west side of Merope the border is more ill-defined but roughly heads southwest for ~20'.  The southern border is also ill-defined but is roughly oriented NW to SE and nearly extends nearly as far as mag 9 HD 23326.


17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, the Merope Nebula is the brightest of the reflection nebulae that encase the Pleiades.  It appears as a moderately bright, very large, fan-shaped cone of light extended in a wedge SW to SE from  Merope.  The boundary of the nebulosity is straighter and better defined along the SE edge where it follows a string of mag 10-11 stars.  The SW border is not as well defined but extends beyond a trio of mag 13 stars.  The fan is broadest at its southern extremity which is roughly 15' from Merope.


16x80 (12/22/84): the Merope nebula was faint but definite in the 16x80 finder using a Deep Sky filter.  Also, nebulosity surrounding other stars were confirmed with confidence at full aperture in the 13.1" at 62x.


8" (10/4/80): very large, faint, very elongated tear-drop shaped nebulosity extending SW away from Merope.  Has a sharper edge along the eastern side.  Best view using the Rich Field Adapter at 37x-50x.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 1435, the Merope Nebula, on 19 Oct 1859 from Venice with his personal 4-inch Steinheil refractor using 45x.  The following historical summary is from Wolfgang Steinicke's book "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters".


The Merope Nebula was the first deep sky object Tempel discovered.  He initially thought it was a comet, but the next night (20th) he checked and found no movement.  The discovery was published on 23 Dec 1860 (AN 54, 285).  Christian August Peters, the editor of Astronomische Nachricten, confirmed the observation using a 7-inch refractor.  Auwers first observed it on 14 Jan 1861, but d'Arrest was unsuccessful using the 11-inch Merz refractor at Copenhagen in Aug 1862.  Based on his negative results on several attempts, he reported "I have hitherto been able positively to see nothing. ...I therefore, even yet, am of opinion that this nebula is variable, otherwise the original announcement of the discovery ... must be looked upon as been greatly exaggerated.  This report began a heated interchange involving many of the world's most prominent visual observers over the next 30 years (see NGC 1555 = Hind's Variable Nebula for a similar situation).


In September 1862, Julius Schmidt supported d'Arrest, claiming if it was not variable he would have noticed it while carefully observing the Pleiades since 1841.  He first reported a sighting on 5 Feb 1861, describing it as "very large, very pale and quite shapeless."  Auwers responded critically to d'Arrest, claiming neither Tempel's (Merope) nebula nor NGC 1333 were variable but that "large, blurred, faint objects are much more easily visible in small instruments than in large ones" and d'Arrest's failure was due to "a small field of view, completely filled by the 15' large nebula".  Charcornac at Paris Observatory also reported the nebula was difficult to see at high power.  Sch?nfeld wrote that the nebula "instantly stuck out in the local telescope (6.5-inch refractor in Mannheim, Germany) on Sept 20, 1862 when I pointed it freely towards Merope, without knowing the exact place, looking like a blurred nebula with the shape and size described by Auwers."


d'Arrest responded to the attack on 12 Nov 1862 (AN 1393) stating "after a long effort I actually set eyes on Tempel's Nebula", though it was "the faintest object which I remember ever having seen in the refractor".  He was "still convinced that the nebula was variable; otherwise the discovery report ["large, bright nebula"] must be seen as highly exaggerated."  In March 1862, Winnecke viewed the nebula with a 4.1-inch refractor at low power and asked Otto Struve to take a look in the 15-inch Merz refractor, convinced that it would be difficult to see in the larger scope.  Winnecke noted "Indeed, we were not convinced about its existence until the telescope was moved quickly back and forth".  Winnecke concluded there was no reason to invoke variability to explain the observations.  In 1863, Tempel wrote a letter to the French magazine Le Monde asserting that nebulae, in general, are unchanging (otherwise their constituent stars would have to be vary simultaneously) and that atmospheric conditions were the source of different observational results.


Reverend Thomas Webb observed the nebula on 6 Oct 1863 with his 5.5-inch Clark refractor, stating "on turning the telescope upon the group at 29x and 64x, though I probably should not have it discovered unknown, I found it with ease, as a very ill-defined, but on the whole egg-shaped haze, encompassing a brilliant star with its smaller but rather brighter end." As far as the variability "he [Sch?nfeld] thinks this and other suspected nebulae, being very feeble, large and diffuse, are influenced in visibility by magnifying power, varying transparency of the air, and practice of the eye, so that aperture is less concerned in their case than in that of minute stars."  Although he never observed the nebula, John Herschel catalogued the Merope Nebula as GC 768 and his description stated "VAR" [variable].


The controversy about the variability and GC entry caused Lawrence Parsons (4th Earl of Rosse) to take a look with the 36-inch and 72-inch reflectors at Birr Castle, but he found no nebulosity in five observations from Feb 1871 to Sep 1873!  Dreyer, himself, was unsuccessful (on a "misty" night) on 24 Dec 1875.  The first (marginal) successful observation at Birr Castle was not made until 10 Dec 1877 and confirmed later that month.


The debate over variability wasn't settled. In 1875 Charles Wolf at Paris Observatory reported he was unable to see the Merope Nebula from Nov 1874 to Feb 1875 and Stephan at Marseille confirmed this. Wolf concluded, "This nebula is truly variable and its period seems to be rather short".  But Tempel published another report in Jan 1877 (AN 2139) concluding, "the invisibility of the Merope Nebula in a large telescope is due to the eyepiece and its field of view. If d'Arrest had used an eyepiece of lower power than 95x, giving a field of 20 to 25'; he would have seen the nebula very easily."  Tempel also made disparaging remarks about the large reflectors at Birr Castle, claiming the 36-inch and 72-inch didn't show more stars than his 11-inch Amici refractor (Tempel and Dreyer had a bitter dispute in 1878 about the "spiral form of nebulae", which Tempel couldn't see in his 11-inch).


On 6 Mar 1877, Maxwell Hall drew the nebula with his 4-inch refractor at 100x and was amazed it was invisible to Lord Rosse and Robert Newall, who had a 25-inch Cooke refractor.  Hall was also critical of Schiaparelli's description of the orientation of the nebula.  Hall's article touched off another debate between Wolf, Common, Hough, Tempel, Swift, Barnard and Burnham.


Charles Wolf published his work on the Pleiades and included a sketch made in Nov 1875.  He saw nebulosity extending to Electra and Celaeno, by masking Merope with the micrometer bar.  A much earlier report by Hermann Goldschmidt to Leverrier in Paris on 21 Sep 1863, claimed he saw not only the Merope nebula but that the Pleiades were completely surrounded by diffuse nebulosity, extending over an area of 5?.


In 1880, Ainslie Common published a drawing of the Pleiades nebulosity using his 36-inch reflector.  It showed a large, elongated patch SE of Merope (the wrong direction!) and two additional patches; one north of Merope and another to the NW of Alcyone.  This caused some more controversy.


In 1880, Tempel published (MNRAS, 40, 622) an excellent drawing of the nebula using Amici I, with accurate form and brightness levels, along with a large number of nearby faint stars.  He mentioned the various astronomers who confirmed the object, including Schmidt, Winnecke Auwers and Sch?nfeld, and also opponents such as d'Arrest, Secchi and the Birr Castle observers.  He stated "But all ambiguity has been since cleared up, for on fitting the large telescopes with eyepieces of a low magnifying power the nebula becomes distinctly visible, and is shown by them with image equal in clearness to that given by the smaller instrucments.  He also criticized Goldschmidt's observation of the Pleiades surrounded by nebulous clouds and the drawing of Common, saying the sketch must have "evidently been executed with a telescope of insufficient power to show the Merope Nebula."  He concluded with satisfaction "It is now ascertained beyond question that the nebula exists...and anyone publishing statements about its non-existence merely uses vain words, and proclaims himself wanting in knowledge of the history and nebulae and the management of telescopes."


Common was offended and responded the "three-foot telescope" mentioned in his report was of three-foot aperture!  Hall wrote one more report on 13 Dec 1880, claiming the nebula had changed shape, now "extending as far as Electra, and the parabolic form of the Nebula, as seen 1877, was destroyed." He wondered why Tempel had overlooked the "extension of the nebula in the direction of Electra."


Amazingly, the controversy of the existence of the Merope Nebula wasn't over. At Dearborn Observatory in Chicago, Hough and Burnham had previously been critical of earlier reports, because of their discordant descriptions and their negative results in 1879 and 1880 using the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at 120x and higher.  After Tempel's paper, they made a concerted effort from 29 Nov 1880 to 22 Mar 1891 with various eyepieces, stopping down the refractor to 12-inch, even masking Merope.  But they came up empty and decided the previous positive observers were misled by the glare from Merope and the neighboring stars!  Dreyer immediately responded, criticizing the large exit pupil used and furthermore he didn't see anything unusual about or contradictory about previous published reports of a "large and diffused nebulosity".  Also, the theory about the glare from Merope causing an illusion was rejected.  Swift also responded on 2 Dec 1881, that he independently ran across the Merope Nebula in 1874 while searching for comets with his 4.5-inch refractor and "strongly suspected it was a new comet."  His analysis was that Hough and Burnham used too high of a power as he could see the nebula even stopped down to 2-inch aperture at 25x.


Barnard observed and drew the Merope Nebula and nearby stars with his 5-inch refractor in 1883.  He wrote "it is plainly visible in my 5-inch refractory, it has been seen with a 2.5-inch telescope, in the presence of a quarter-full moon."  He criticized Common's sketch but felt his sketch agreed with Tempel's (though it extended further west past Electra).  Barnard also mentioned that Trouvelot reported that it is variable and had become very faint (he described the nebula as changing to a dim purplish color) and "can now be seen only by those acquainted with its former appearance"!


Paul and Prosper Henry first photographed the Pleiades on 16 Nov 1885 and revealed additional nebulosity around Maia, later catalogued as NGC 1432 (the only photographic discovery in the NGC) as well as faint nebulosity near Electra.  In 1886 Charles Wolf published a comparison between the photographic image and the visual observations that showed significant changes in the Merope Nebula.  Morever, the separate nebula observed by Goldschmidt and Wolf had disappeared but he concluded that photographic and visual observations can never be reconciled as objects invisible on photographs can exist visually.  Surprisingly, the image most closely resembled the ridiculed drawing of Common.  Common wrote that his sketch showed the Maia Nebula, however the connection is poor - his placement is closer to Alcyone than Maia.


The image encouraged others to search for addition nebulae in the Pleiades. On 26 Feb 1886, Spitaler and Palisa in Vienna reported the Maia nebula appeared as a "small flaky nebulosity, completely separated from Maia" and on 3 Mar, the former was "only the brightest knot of an extended nebulosity, completely covering Maia." Spitaler wrote "one can hardly refrain from thinking that at least the whole Pleiades region west and north of Alcyone is covered by an extended nebulosity, of which all previously perceived, apparently isolated nebulae, are merely bright knots of light."


On 23 Oct 1886 Isaac Roberts took a 3 hour exposure which revealed "not only are the stars [Alcyone, Maia, Electra, Merope] surrounded by nebulae, but the nebulosity extends in streamers and fleecy masses, till it seems almost to fill the spaces between the stars, and to extend far beyond them."  Common again felt vindicated and repeated his treatment by Tempel, "who thought I had not used a sufficiently large telescope" (a misunderstanding by Tempel).


Another image was taken by the Henry brothers in 1888 showing extensive nebulosity. At an RAS meeting on 8 Jun 1888, Common says "I immediately compared my sketches with it and found that every star I had seen, except one, was there, and, of course, in their proper places."  Robert Newall, who also attended the meeting, stated he was certain that his observations differed from Common with Merope appearing as an oval comet with Merope at the focus and he had not seen the additional patches claimed by Common.


In an 1888 issue of Knowledge, English astronomer Arthur Ranyard wrote an article titled "Great Nebula in the Pleiades" and stated "The observations are worth examining, as they throw some light on the differences which are always likely to exist when observations are pushed into the border-land of vision, where by reason of the extreme faintness or minuteness of the objects examined, the eye begins to fail, and the imagination begins to play a larger and larger part in filling up the gaps where the senses of the eye-straining observer fail him."


Maxwell Hall made a late interesting set of observations in 1889 in Jamaica.  He compared the view of the Merope Nebula using a 9-inch reflector with a glass mirror and his 4-inch Cook refractor.  He reported "a glance through the refractor showed the well-known nebula projected against the dark background or field of view; but in the reflector there was so much light scattered around the field of view that the nebula was invisible."  He concluded this explained the positive sightings in smaller refractors and vice versa, the failure with larger reflectors (especially Lord Rosse's initial failures).  In 1891, Spitaler reviewed the major observations of the Pleiades nebulae in a 20-page paper and created a remarkable map of the region, showing extensive nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades.  He argues his map shows the main structures were correctly drawn and generally only the boundaries vary.


IC 349 is a knot of nebulosity just 0.6' SSE of Merope discovered and sketched by Barnard in 1890 using the 36-inch refractor at Lick.  The discovery was published in AN 3018.  See WSQJ July 1992.  In terms of distance, Steinicke notes this is the closest NGC object.

See observing notes for NGC 1437.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1436 = D 562 = h2581 = h2582 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta and described "a pretty large faint round nebula, about 3.5' diameter, gradual slight condensation to the centre, very faint at the margin."  His position was 22' too far SSE.


John Herschel logged it on 9 Jan 1836 (sweep 636) as "very bright, and evidently a globular cluster." He only gave the rough place from Dunlop.  He made another observation (h2582) on 28 Nov 1837 (sweep 801) but assumed it was new and as a result NGC 1436 = NGC 1437.   Dorothy Carlson and RNGC list NGC 1436 as "Not Found".  See Corwin's notes for the full story.


While searching for NGC 1436 with the Great Melbourne Telescope on 14 Feb 1888, Pietro Baracchi discovered ESO 358-059.  He called it "vF, S, R, gbM.  This is called in diagram GC 770 [NGC 1437] but I hardly think it can be it."

William Herschel discovered NGC 1440 = H II-458 = h2583 on 6 Oct 1785 (sweep 459) and recorded "pB, R, bM." John Herschel made two observations from South Africa, logging it on 11 Dec 1835 as "pB; R; vsmbM to a nucleus = *13' 60" dia."  WH also made an observation on 20 Sep 1786 with a 1? error in declination, with the designation II-594.  JH included this observation in the GC (773), although he noted that Auwers considered it identical to II-458.  Dreyer added it as NGC 1442, also noting it was probably identical to NGC 1440.


Joseph Turner observed this galaxy on 10 Nov 1877 with the Great Melbourne Telescope and noted it "resembles a planetary nebula with a faint halo surrounding the nucleus, which is a little elongated n the north-following direction."


Finally, Francis Leavenworth found this galaxy again in 1886, recorded it in the second discovery list (#387) from the Leander McCormick observatory but made a 2 min error in RA (too far east).  Dreyer assumed it was new and was catalogued as NGC 1458.  So, NGC 1440 = NGC 1442 = NGC 1458.  Finally, NGC 1430, also from Leavenworth, may be another duplicate observation of NGC 1440.

William Herschel found NGC 1442 = H II-594 on 20 Sep 1786 (sweep 597) and logged "pB, vS, R, bM."  There is nothing at his position and it was reported as not found on Harvard plates taken with the Bruce astrograph in South Africa (Baker, 1937).  But exactly one degree north is NGC 1440 = H II-458, which he earlier discovered on 6 Oct 1785.  The equivalence was first noted by Auwers but John Herschel still included his father's observation in the GC (774) as well as Dreyer in the NGC with the comment H. II-594 is probably identical to H. II-458 = NGC 1440.  Leavenworth found this galaxy again in 1886 and reported it as new in his second list (#387, later NGC 1458), though his RA was 2 minutes of time too large.

J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 1446 on 8 Jan 1877 observing with the 72" at Birr Castle.  He commented "perhaps a vF neb f [NGC 1441]" with no micrometric offsets and the sketch only shows two stars following NGC 1441, so it's unclear what object Dreyer had in mind. (in 1882).  Wilhelm Tempel independently recorded a new object in 1882 with the 11-inch refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and placed it 16 seconds of RA east of NGC 1441 and +3/4' in declination.  There is nothing at this exact separation and Harold Corwin lists a possible star if the +3' to 4' should read -3' to 4'.  Dreyer assumed both observations referred to the same object, so he and Tempel are credited in the NGC.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1448 = h2585 on 14 Dec 1835 and recorded "pB, vL, vmE, 3' l, 20" br, position = 221.6 degrees."

He also recorded h2586 = NGC 1457 (observed on 3 different sweeps; the first on 24 Oct 1835), which all point exactly to this galaxy.  I'm surprised he didn't notice there was only a single bright galaxy here!   By priority, NGC 1457 should be the primary designation, instead of NGC 1448 which is commonly used.  The IC 2 notes state "1448 = 1457 (DeLisle Stewart); h on different nights".  ESO labels this galaxy as NGC 1448 = NGC 1457 and MCG calls it NGC 1448.

But even closer (1.7' W) is the brighter edge-on LEDA 993557, which I apparently missed, so I'm not confident of the observation.


Lewis Swift found NGC 1450 = Sw. V-56 = LM 1-113 = LM 1-114 on 22 Oct 1886 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory. His position is 16 seconds of RA due east of PGC 13775.  Ormond Stone discovered this galaxy earlier in 1886 at the Leander McCormick Observatory and described a double nebula with separation 0.5' (only one galaxy is listed in NED and LEDA).


Frank Muller (also from the LM Observatory) noted the equivalence with Stone's object in a Sidereal Messenger article (Feb 1887) that listed nebulae from Swift's 5th catalogue which had been discovered previously. As a result Dreyer assigned a single NGC designation, crediting both Swift and Stone. As the LM discovery list was submitted to the Astronomical Journal on 12 Oct 1886, Stone made the earlier discovery.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1471 = LM 1-116 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 14.5, vS, pE 45?."  His description is accurate, though his rough position is 1 minute 40 seconds of RA due east of PGC 13976 (typical error).  Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy again on 1 Nov 1886 and included it in list V-57 (later NGC 1464). So, NGC 1471 = NGC 1464, with discovery priority to Leavenworth.  The primary designation used today is NGC 1464 due to its more precise coordinates. See Corwin's notes for more.

This galaxy is identified as IC 2002 in UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 due to a poor declination by Marth. RNGC reverses the sign of the declination.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 1474 = m 93 on 5 Oct 1864 and logged "vF, S, R."  His position is 8' S of UGC 2898 = PGC 14065, but this is the only nearby galaxy he could have seen. Several objects discovered by Marth that evening have poor positions including NGC 1141 and NGC 1142 (dec error of 40').  Stephane Javelle independently found the galaxy on 21 Dec 1903 and measured an accurate position for J. 3-983 (later IC 2002).  So, NGC 1474 = IC 2002.  UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 only use the IC designation as the position is unambiguous, though online catalogues (NED, HyperLEDA and SIMBAD) equate NGC 1474 = IC 2002.  In addition, PGC and RNGC reversed the sign of the declination of NGC 1474 (repeated in Roger Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 and amateur software including Megastar).

John Herschel discovered NGC 1483 = h2595 on 14 Dec 1835 (and possibly earlier by Dunlop) and recorded "pretty faint; round; very little brighter in the middle; 20".

His second observation reads "very faint; pretty large; round; very gradually a little brighter in the middle; 80" across. I feel convinced that this nebula is too faint to have been seen by Mr Dunlop. Put on the 9 inch aperture, could not discern the least trace of it.  Mirror polished yesterday and in high beauty.

James Dunlop discovered D 427 on 2 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta and reported "a pretty large nebula, round figure, 2' or 3' diameter".  D 428 was described as "An extremely faint ill-defined small nebula.  A pretty large nebula (D 427) precedes this."  Despite Herschel's comments, Dunlop's position for D 428 lands very close to NGC 1483, although there is only a single object here, so perhaps this is a coincidence.

Appears roughly 4'x2', extending SSW to NNE and brighter on the south end.  The west side has a fairly hard, well-defined edge while the east side is more irregular and fades into the background.  Four faint stars are involved on the northern end and a pair of fainter stars are at the south end.


17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, this is a moderately bright, roundish glow, ~3' diameter.  Extends mostly west of a mag 11 star, wrapping around the star, particularly on the north side.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter as it appears bright with an irregular surface brightness.  There is a subtle bite cut out of the nebulosity on the east side that creates a darker hollow extending just west of the star.  At 220x (unfiltered), about a half dozen stars are involved or at the edges.  The nebulosity is quite irregular with a high surface brightness region preceding the star.  Faint, elongated haze extends from this patch to the NE past the star giving an elongated appearance.  A pair of mag 13-14 stars is at the northern end and another pair is just off the western edge.


17.5" (12/8/90): at 140x with OIII filter appears as a bright, moderately large, circular nebulosity involving a mag 11 star.  The brightest portion lies to the west of the star and is elongated 3:2 ~N-S.  There appears be a dark gap just west of the mag 11 star.  Two very faint stars are superimposed near the edges.

On a second sweep he was critical of Dunlop's discovery and commented "faint; large; round; very gradually a little brighter in the middle; 2.5' across. With 9" aperture, and a mirror newly polished yesterday, and in high beauty, it is barely possible to discern with the utmost attention that this nebula exists; but to have discovered it with that aperture and power 180 would have been quite out of the question; possibly, however, 90 might show it better."

17.5" (12/30/99): at 220x, this is an easily resolved trio of mag 13.5-14 stars forming a small isosceles triangle (separations of 30", 30", 45").  This triple star or asterism is the closest object to William Herschel's position but it's difficult to see how he confused it with a poor cluster.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1498 = H VII-3 on 8 Feb 1784 (sweep 136) and recorded "a small cluster of compressed stars, containing some pretty large."  Dreyer notes in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel", that "there is no very pronounced cluster near the place."  Herschel's reference star was 3 Leporis with an offset of -72m 30s and -30' dec.  This places NGC 1498 at 03 59 54 -12 01 (J2000) and Auwer's reduction gives the same position.  A close trio of mag 13/14 stars lies at 04 00 19.4 -12 01 11 (mean of three stars with a maximum separation of ~45"), which is a plausible candidate although doesn't qualify as a "small cluster of compressed stars."  Pietro Baracchi searched for this object unsuccessfully a couple of times in 1887 with the Great Melbourne Telescope. See Corwin's notes for more of the story.

NGC 1499 = LBN 756 = Ced 26 = Sh 2-220 = California Nebula

04 03 14 +36 22 06; Per

Size 145'x40'


17.5" (1/16/02): Despite its reputation as a challenging target, this was an easy, fascinating object at 64x with a H-beta filter. The California Nebula is HUGE and extended a full two eyepiece fields even using a 31 Nagler for a total length of over 2.5 degrees and with a varying width of 15'-30', extended WNW-ESE.  The E-W border is well-defined with a filter, particularly in the general vicinity of Xi Persei (middle of three naked-eye stars in the leg of Perseus collinear with the Pleiades) on the southern border and a long straight stretch on the northern edge.  Along the northern edge, there is some filamentary, wispy structure similar to the view of the Veil nebula in a small scope!


The nebulosity is weaker and more disorganized, though, close to the preceding and following ends. The nebula tapers towards the eastern end where there are some additional brighter streaks and dark intrusions near a group of stars.  Portions of the central region are clearly fainter with no evident structure.  At the west end the structure is also chaotic with an irregular mix of weak nebulosity and darker voids.  There is much to view here even at 64x, and I spent 30 minutes scanning the entire length for structure.


17.5" (10/28/89): the California Nebula requires very low power and visibility is best using an H-beta filter.  At 82x appears very large, faint, very elongated, irregular low surface brightness with darker lanes and some wispy structure along the edges.  The most well-defined section of the border is near a mag 8.5 star bordering the southern edge.  Located roughly 30' N of mag 4.0 Xi Persei.


13.1" (1/18/85): definite contrast gain with H-beta filter as only the section NW of Xi was definite using a Daystar 300 filter (siimlar to UHC), but the H-beta shows the full extent easily.


13x80mm (1/13/07): excellent view in my 80mm finder using a 24mm Panoptic and an H-beta filter as a huge, elongated bar of fairly high contrast stretching across the field.  The glow is generally brightest in the broad middle section between Xi Persei and the 6th magnitude star off the central north side.  The nebula noticeably tapers towards the southeast end as the northern side of this end squeezes inward.  Similarly, the northwest end also tapers as the northern boundary narrows towards the southern side.


16x80mm (7/27/84): very large and faint, very elongated WNW-ESE, sharper and brighter on WNW edge, very low surface brightness.  Improved contrast with an H-beta filter.


15x50mm IS binoculars (8/27/11): very faintly visible as a large, elongated glow near Xi Persei using a pair of 2" H-beta filters over the objectives.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 1499, the California Nebula, on 3 Nov 1885 while searching for comets with the 6-inch Cooke Equatorial refractor at Vanderbilt University Observatory.  In the Sidereal Messenger (Vol 5, p27), he reported "this requires the lowest power and cannot be seen by direct vision. It is only by directing the vision slightly to one side of its place that it is pssible to see it, then flashes out feebly."  The NGC position is near the following end.


Simon Archenhold produced the first photograph on 27 Oct 1891.  He quickly published an article with a sketch of the outline (nearly 2?) and apparently felt it was too large photographically to be identical to Barnard's intended object.  Barnard responded in an 1894 article that he discovered this object visually and published a photographed taken in 1895 with the Willard lens in Astrophysical Journal, 2, 350.

Herschel noted this nebula might be equivalent to James Dunlop's D 369, which was described as "a faint nebula, elliptical in the parallel of the equator, about 30" long and 12" broad".  Dunlop's position is 2 min 30 sec of RA east of this galaxy and not nearly as elongated as Dunlop's description.  This equivalence is not given by Glen Cozens or Wolfgang Steinicke.

The mag 14.4 central star was steadily visible.  On closer inspection the thin rim was clearly irregular in surface brightness and slightly brighter along the southwest and northeast sides with a couple of tiny knots embedded in the rim.  The slightly darker interior was weakly mottled or patchy with subtle variations in surface brightness.


17.5" (1/8/00): at 100x, this moderately bright PN was irregularly round, 1' diameter, weakly annular with a faint glimpse of the central star.  There was a good contrast gain with the OIII filter and the image was crisp-edged, slightly elongated SW-NE and the small, darker center was more evident.  Excellent view at 220x with the faint central star (mag 14.4) clearly visible.  The surface brightness was irregular with an unevenly brighter outer rim.  The central star was visible steadily at 280x and the overall surface brightness was mottled or "clumpy" (brighter on west and NE rim), darkening in the center.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1501 = H IV-53 on 3 Nov 1787 (sweep 774) using the front-view (no secondary) design with a power of 157.  He described "a very curious planetary nebula of nearly 1' in diameter; it is round, pretty well defined of a uniform light and pretty bright."  Just 6 nights later, he reported "with 360 much magnitified, but still the borders pretty abruptly defined, irregularly elliptical."  John Herschel didn't report an observation.


On 15 Jan 1868 Lawrence Parsons, the son of Lord Rosse, reported "a bright ring and inside it a dark annulus, very decided.  A star in the centre seen very clearly and continuously with various powers; suspect variable [unequal?] brightness in the ring, perhaps a dark spot in it nearly on the p side.  The f side of the ring appears broadest and to approach the central star nearer than the preceding side does.  The n and s sides of the ring seem rather brighter than the p and f sides.  Suspect other bright points in it, but am not at all certain.  It is slightly elliptical, its major axis being nearly p and f."


Based on a Crossley photograph, Curtis (1918) described, "central star nearly mag 12, surrounded by a very irregular and patchy elliptical disk, about 56"x48" in pa 98?.  The periphery shows traces of a broken ring formation the brightest portions are the edges at the ends of the minor axis."


On a 60-inch Mt Wilson photograph, Pease (1917) reported "this is a fine planetary of regular elliptical shape, 60"x45", p.a. 120?, with protuberances at each end of the minor axis making a total breadth 53". The nebula is irregularly mottled, bearing a resemblance to the convolutions of the brain."

NGC 1509 = IC 2026 forms a close pair with MCG -02-11-012 = PGC 14389 just 1.2' W.  At first I thought it was a very faint mag 15-15.5 star, but with extended viewing, a 15" knot was seen.  This companion is often misidentified as IC 2026.


Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1509 = LM 1-122 = Sw. V-59 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Stone reported (2 observations), "mag 14.0, 0.1' dia, R, gbM."  His rough position (accurate to the nearest min of RA and less than 1' too far north) is close enough to be unambiguous.


Lewis Swift found NGC 1509 again on 22 Oct 1886 and logged (list V-59), "vF; vS; lE; F* nr p[receding]."  His position is 9 sec of RA following MCG -02-11-013 and it's possible the "F* nr p" refers to PGC 14389 (as I almost thought).  Frank Muller noted the equivalence with Stone's object in a Sidereal Messenger article (Feb 1887) that listed nebulae from Swift's 5th catalogue which had been discovered previously. Dreyer credited both Swift and Stone with the discovery in the NGC (in that order), but the Leander McCormick discovery list was submitted to the Astronomical Journal on 12 Oct 1886, so discovery priority goes to Stone.


Bigourdan reobserved the galaxy in 1897 but assumed it was a nova (misidentifying a nearby star as NGC 1509) and it received the number IC 2026.  So, NGC 1509 = IC 2026.  Howe also observed the field in 1899-1900 and measured an accurate position with the 20" refractor at Denver. See Corwin's identification notes for more.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1512 = D 466 = h2607 on 29 Oct 1826 and described "a small faint round nebula, about 25 arcseconds diameter, a little brighter in the centre: a star of 10th or 12th magnitude preceding the nebula."  Dunlop made a single observation and his position is 10' SE of the galaxy (typical error).


John Herschel made 3 observations:  On 24 Oct 1835 he logged "bright, large, slightly elongated, pretty suddenly brighter in the middle, 3' diameter; it is just north of a great group of large stars 6, 7 and 8th mag, scattered over two or three fields."  On a second sweep he noted "Globular.  bright, pretty large, round, 3' diameter. Resolved into stars barely perceptible." Finally, on a third sweep he recorded "B, R, gpmbM."  Based on the second description, Herschel identified this object as a globular cluster in the GC.


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 1512 on 5 Dec 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope as sharply concentrated with a very small bright nucleus and faint halo.  He commented "I cannot make out any distinct appearance of stars, although at times there is a suspicion of sparkling about the center - Indeed it has all the appearance of an ordinary nebula, round and much brighter in the centre.  His unpublished lithograph (plate II, figure 11) shows a ring surrounding the core and nucleus.  The east side of the halo or ring seems to be connected to the core by a bar.


Based on the GC, Dreyer identified NGC 1512 as a globular in the NGC.  The IC 2, though, has a note from DeLisle Stewart "Not a globular cl, but an eF ring nebula".  Oh a photograph taken at the Helwan Observatory in Egypt, the galaxy was described in 1921 as a Phi-type (barred-ring) spiral.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1513 = H VII-60 on 28 Dec 1790 (sweep 989) and recorded "A L cl of considerable L stars, pretty compressed and very rich, iR, about 7' dia."  His position is accurate.

48" (10/25/14): at 610x unfiltered; very bright and large; very irregular surface brightness, the rim varies greatly in thickness and brightness.  The relatively thick rim is very bright in the northwest quadrant, along roughly a 70? arc.  A second enhanced portion of the rim is along the southeast end (~35? arc) and a third slightly smaller, bright region (more circular) is on the east end.  The rim is weak on the south or south-southwest end as well as the north and northeast side.  A mag 17 star is at the edge of the rim on the southwest end. A few modest outer lobes were evident; the rim bulges out on the southeast side (near the two enhancements on this end) and to a lesser extent on the northwest and the south end.  The mag 9.5 star at the center and a very faint companion to its southeast are surrounded by a darker central hole.


18" (2/4/08): at 175x, appears as a large, roundish glow (~2.5'x2.2) surrounding a bright mag 9.4 central star.  Excellent response to UHC and OIII filters.  The surface brightness is clearly irregular with subtle brighter and darker regions.  The SW and NE ends were slightly dimmer, while the NW and SE portions of the rim were brighter.  The region around the central star was also slightly darker.


17.5" (12/30/99): at 100x, moderately bright, round, ~2' halo surrounding a prominent mag 9.5 star.  Displayed an excellent response to UHC and OIII blinking while the H-beta filter killed the PN (OIII/H-beta = 12).  Using the OIII filter, the surface brightness was noticeably uneven, with the NW quadrant of the rim clearly brighter.  The SE end was also weakly enhanced while the center and ends of the minor axis were slightly darker.  At 220x using a UHC filter, the halo appeared nearly 2.5' in diameter.  There was a small, darker "hole" surrounding the central star and the halo was clearly irregular with a brighter "knot" on the SE side, while the NW portion of the halo was brighter along the rim.


17.5" (9/14/85): very bright, large, round, 2' diameter.  Contains a very bright mag 9.5 central star surrounded by a fairly bright halo with an irregular surface brightness.  Located midway between mag 8.3 SAO 57017 8' NNW and mag 9 SAO 57021 8' S.


13.1" (12/22/84): bright, fairly large, round, dominated by a mag 9.5 central star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1514 = H IV-69 = h311 on 13 Nov 1790 (sweep 980) and wrote, "A most singular phenomenon. A star of about 8th magnitude with a faint luminous atmosphere of a circular form, and about 3' in diameter. The star is perfectly in the center and the atmosphere is so diluted, faint and equal throughout that there can be no surmise of its consisting of stars; nor can there be a doubt of the evident connection between the atmosphere and the star. Another star, not much less in brightness and in the same field with the above, was perfectly free from any such appearance."


The striking symmetry of NGC 1514 caused Herschel to rethink his idea of planetary nebulae.  He previously assumed all nebulae were unresolved stellar clusters of some kind, disguised by their great distance. After this point, he was convinced of the existence of pure nebulosity, out of which individual stars or planets were born and he no longer expected every nebula to be resolved with enough aperture.  This essentially destroyed his interest in the 40-foot telescope (48-inch aperture), although the difficulty in using this unwieldy scope was also a major factor.


A total of 20 observations were made with the 72" at Birr Castle with one of the earliest (13 Jan 1852) by Bindon Stoney.  He described NGC 1514 as a "new spiral of an annular form round the star, which is central; Brightest part is sf the star, spirality is very faint, but I have no doubt of its existence".  Stoney and later R.J. Mitchell sketched an irregular rim with brighter and dimmer sections.  Samuel Hunter made a sketch on 9 Jan 1858 with a brighter reversed "S" shape within an oval halo.  A version of this sketch was chosen (over Stoney and Mitchell's sketches) for LdR's 1861 publication (plate XXV, figure 7).  Resolving spiral structure was a major theme at Birr Castle but irregularities in the rim was likely the cause of this illusion.

Very bright and large, very elongated at least 4:1 SSW-NNE, ~4.5'x1' with a bulging core -- similar to a smaller version of NGC 7331.  The overall surface brightness is high with a very high surface brightness elongated core.  NGC 1515A lies 2.0' SW of center.  The companion appeared faint, fairly small, round, 30" diameter with a small brighter core and a very low surface brightness halo.  Despite the closeness, the companion is more than 10 times as distant as NGC 1515.  Member of the Dorado Group.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1515 = D348 = h2609 on 5 Nov 1826 using his 9-inch f/12 reflector from Parramatta.  He found "a very faint nebula, about 35 arcseconds diameter. This precedes a group of small stars."  His position is 1 min 15 sec of RA too far east (typical error) and a group of mag 12 stars follows. John Herschel first observed this galaxy on 5 Dec 1834 and logged "B, L, vmE, gbM; 3' l, 40" br".


Joseph Turner observed this galaxy on 26 Nov 1877 and Pietro Baracchi on 6 Dec 1885 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope but neither noticed the companion close west.

17.5" (2/11/96): at first view (fairly poor seeing) appeared as a single but irregular galaxy elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE, 1.0'x0.5'.  In periods of better seeing, the system resolved into an extremely close contact pair with the brighter component at the SSE end, round, 25" diameter.  The fainter component is attached at the NNW end, round, 20" diameter.  A mag 15 star lies 1' S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1516 = H III-499 = h2610 on 30 Jan 1786 (sweep 516) and recorded "vF, S, E, easily resolvable." JH observed this double system twice from the CGH, logging it (on his second sweep) as "vF; first vg then psvmbM, 20" diameter".  Ormond Stone (I-113 and I-114) independently found this system again on 31 Dec 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  He resolved the individual members, noting a separation of 0.5' in PA 340? [NNW-SSE], but his rough position (nearest min of RA) is over two minutes of RA too large.  Dreyer assumed these were new nebulae and assigned the numbers NGC 1524 and NGC 1525.   So, NGC 1516 should apply to the entire double system found by Herschel, while NGC 1524 and NGC 1525 should apply to the individual members found by Stone.  But the components are generally labeled NGC 1516A and NGC 1516B.  The RNGC declination is 3' too far south.  See Corwin's notes.

The surface is knotty, streaky and mottled.  A striking dust lane runs along the major axis, slicing the galaxy asymmetrically into two parts to the south of the core.  The dust lane expands to a larger, elongated (dark) patch on the NE side of the core.  The section to the south of the dust lane is much thinner and brightens to a prominent, very bright knotty 1.5' streak on the SW end [brightest part of a tidal tail extending towards NGC 1531].  A very faint star (B = 18.2) is close to the southwest tip of the bright streak.  The fainter strip of galaxy south of the dust lane near the core appears patchy, probably due to dust and star-forming knots.  Just northwest of the core is NGC 1531, a bright elliptical that angles perpendicular to the core and forms a striking pair.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1532 = D 600 = h2621 on 29 Oct 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta, NSW, and described "an extremely faint ill-defined nebula, rather elongated in the direction of the meridian, gradualy a little brighter towards the centre."  Dunlop's position (single observation) is 7' too far east.  John Herschel observed this showpiece galaxy on 3 differents sweeps, recording it first on 19 Oct 1835 as "B, vL, vmE, 5' long; A fine and curious object. The following and brighter of two [with NGC 1531]. In the ray is either a vF * or a knot in the nebula."


Joseph Turner sketched the pair on 30 Nov 1875 using the 48-inch Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate II, figure 14) as well as Albert Le Sueur (unpublished plate VII, figure 82).  Turner's sketch shows a brighter thin streak along the south edge of the southwest end of the galaxy.

48" (11/1/13): at 813x, this gorgeous planetary displayed an extremely bright, green double-shell structure.  The 20" diameter inner ring was quite striking with slight irregularities in thickness and brightness and a very slight elongation.  The darker interior of the inner ring was mottled with subtle darker and brighter patches around the mag 12.5 central star.  The outer shell doubled the diameter and was slightly elongated ~N-S, 40"x35", with a mag 14.5-15 star superimposed on the NW side [16" from the central star].  With extended viewing there appeared to be subtle variations in brightness, almost like radial striations in the outer and inner shell.  (Similar view on 10/23/14).


24" (11/24/14): I didn't take notes, but at 500x a mag 14.5-15 star was faintly visible near the northwest edge of the outer shell [16" from center].


18" (1/1/08): In good seeing at 565x the complex double shell structure of this gorgeous planetary was remarkable.  The bright mag 12.5 central star was surrounded by a well-defined dark central hole with subtle mottling.  The bright inner ring (20" diameter) was relatively narrow, sharply defined and striking. The ring had a clumpy appearance, particularly on the north side and it dimmed slightly on the southeast side.  An outer shell of fainter nebulosity doubled the diameter.  Although the inner ring is round, the outer envelope was slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  At 807x the view was stunning with brighter knots within the inner ring appearing to sparkle at times.


17.5" (12/30/99): this planetary has beautiful, bluish double-shell structure which was very evident at 100x surrounding a bright central star.  The view at 380x and 500x was superb in good seeing. The double shell envelope was very prominent with a bright inner ring, ~20" diameter, with a fairly sharp edge embedded in a fainter roundish halo roughly doubling the diameter.  The inner shell was irregularly darker surrounding the central star.


17.5" (2/8/91): very bright, fairly small, high surface brightness, mag 12.5 central star visible, blue color.  This planetary has a double shell structure with inner shell slightly elongated and a faint rounder outer shell.  Small dark gaps are visible around the central star.


13" (12/22/84): at 360x the central star visible surrounded by two shells. The bright inner shell has a small dark annulus surrounding the central star and the outer envelope is fainter and more diffuse.


8": bright, greenish, fairly small, round.


13x80mm finder (1/15/07): fairly bright stellar object at 13x in my 80mm finder and very easy to identify with blinking.  Appears as a soft bluish star at 25x and definitely non-stellar at 32x and  54x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1535 = H IV-26 = h2618 on 1 Feb 1785 (sweep 364) and recorded "a very curious planetary, vB of a uniform brightness all but the edges which are ill defined; about half a minute in diam.  With 240 proportionally magnified, perfectly R or perhaps a little elliptical."  On a second observation he called it resolvable on the borders, and probably a very compressed cluster of stars at an immense distance.  From the Cape of Good Hope, JH recorded "B; S; R; first pretty suddenly, then very gradually brighter in the middle; 20" across. A mottled disc, but so hazy at the borders that I have no doubt of its being a very distant and highly compressed globular cluster. It is not a planetary nebula, though a near approach to one: does not bear magnifying. A power of 320 is of no use. A very remarkable and interesting object."  Possibly irregularities in the rim influenced JH to believe it was a GC.


William Lassell observed NGC 1535 on 7 Jan 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector from Malta and commented, "the most interesting and extraordinary object of the kind I have ever seen.  A bright well-defined star, perhaps 11th magnitude, right in the centre of a circular nebula, whose edge was the brightest part; and this nebula again placed upon a larger and fainter, concentric and equally symmetrical."  His sketch was published in his 1854 MRAS paper (figure 4) on observations from Malta. He sketched it again in 1862 with his 48-inch and wrote, "An extraordinary and beautiful Planetary Nebula powers 760 and 1060.  The circumferential nebula fades away at its upper margin and the lowe and opposite part of the circumference is less strongly defined than the preceding and following sides.  Moreover, the nucleus does not seem stellar, but a small patch of bright light."


Ralph Copeland, made a detailed observation using Lord Rosse's 72" on 19 Dec 1873: "blue planetary nebula.  A small stellar nucleus with a bright atmosphere surrounded by a fainter one [double-shell structure].  There is a very small vacuity close to and sf the nucleus - power 414.  Outside diam np and sf = 45.1"; diameter of bright atmosphere = 18.4".  With power 625 the nucleus seems quite granular and surrounded by a narrow dark ring extending quite round.  Position of two of the most conspicuous central granules = 81.2?."


Sherburne Wesley Burnham, observing with the Lick 36-inch refractor, commented "besides the central star, there are other fainter stars within the nebula.  The most prominent of these is near the northern edge of the circular disc... The 14.5m star does not seem to have been seen by other observers [Lassell noted a faint star just inside its preceding edge]."  Burnham measured the position of this star at 16" in PA 324? (NW) of the central star.

Holm 73a = LEDA 3093623 appeared faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter (core).  Forms a close pair with Holm 73b = LEDA 940994 45" NE.  The companion was extremely to very faint, also just 6" diameter (core).


IC 2045 (identified as NGC 1538 in RNGC and PGC) appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 20" diameter, very small slightly brighter core. IC 2045 is the brightest in a small group including IC 2047 5' ESE and Holmberg 73 (pair) 8' ESE.  With my 17.5" on 12/30/99, IC 2045 was logged as faint, very small, round, 20" diameter, weak concentration.  Situated between a mag 10 star 3' NE and a mag 9 star 5.5' SW.


Ormond Stone discovered NGC 1538 = LM 1-125 on 31 Dec 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and noted "mag 16.0, 0.1' dia, R, gbM."  His rough position (nearest minute of RA) is very close southeast of Holmberg 73a = LEDA 3093623, but could easily apply to other nearby galaxies given the inaccuracy of the Leander McCormick positions.


Harold Corwin remarks that Herbert Howe assumed Ho 73A was NGC 1538 when he observed the field on 20 Jan 1900 with the 20" refractor in Denver and also discovered nearby IC 2045 and IC 2047.  Stone's rough position is 8' southeast of IC 2045 = PGC 14722, described by Howe as "eF, eS, almost stellar; near [NGC] 1538." and 4' southeast of IC 2047 = LEDA 941480, noted as "eF, eS, difficult, near [NGC 1538]."


RNGC and PGC identify IC 2045 (the brightest of these galaxies) as NGC 1538.   But Corwin examined Stone's discovery sketch and NGC 1538 appears to be a better match with IC 2047.  So, we are left with three possible candidates for NGC 1538 and the identification is uncertain.

Size 20'


18" (2/14/10): at 175x there was nothing that looked remotely cluster-like in the 35' field or that I felt might have caught Herschel's attention -- just a random scattered star field with no denser groupings.  At 73x (67' field), though, my attention was drawn to mag 7.7 HD 27403 on the south side of the eyepiece field.  Extending to the west and southwest of this brighter star was an elongated group highlighted by an oval ring, roughly 10' diameter with several mag 10 stars.  A collection of fainter stars that follows the oval ring extends the overall dimensions to 20' x 10'.


Still, the asterism I described was unimpressive and not rich enough to mimic a cluster, but seemed the best fit in the nearby area to Herschel's object.  If this group is Herschel's h312, then his position for the brightest star is exactly 20' N of HD 27403 and matches in RA, so a single digit error in dec would explain the discrepancy.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1548 = h312 on 3 Feb 1832 (sweep 399) and described "The chief * of a very loose poor cluster 30' diam; little comp; stars 10...12m."  There is nothing near his position and Karl Reinmuth states in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel nach Aufnahmen der K?nigstuhl-Sternwarte" that "no CL found; many st in milky way".  Brian Skiff calls this object "just a sparse, unconcentrated group of stars slightly brighter than the background."  But 20' south of Herschel's position I noticed that mag 7.7 HD 27403 and the surrounding field is probably the best match for Herschel's object.  See Corwin's notes.

Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 1550 on 29 Dec 1861 with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen.  His micrometric position (measured on two nights) corresponds with UGC 3012 = PGC 14880.  WH discovered this galaxy on 8 Oct 1785, but made a 1 degree error in recording his declination (too far south) and it was catalogued as H II-464 = NGC 1551.  d'Arrest searched unsuccessfully for NGC 1551 and suspected WH made an error in his declination.  So, NGC 1550 = NGC 1551. Nearby IC 366 was missed by d'Arrest and discovered by Sherburne Burnham with the 36-inch at Lick.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1551 = H II-464 on 8 Oct 1785 (sweep 462) and recorded "F, vS, r[esolvable]."  There is nothing at his position and Dreyer comments in the NGC Notes "Not found at Copenhagen [by d'Arrest], not at Birr Castle.  GC 835 [NGC 1550] is exactly 1? north; they are probably identical."  NGC 1550 was found by Heinrich d'Arrest on 29 Dec 1861 and accurately placed.  By historical precidence, WH's II-464 = NGC 1551 should be the primary designation but modern catalogues identify this galaxy as NGC 1550 because of the unambiguous positional match.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1553 = D 331 on 5 Nov 1826 and described "a rather bright nebula about 1' diameter, very faint at the margin, gradually bright to the centre: a small star north, and another south, both involved in the margin of the nebula. A group of very small stars north."  Dunlop made a 1 hr copying error in his RA (verified by Glen Cozens after examining Dunlop's original observations), and his corrected position is only 10' S of this galaxy, a typical error.  Wolfgang Steinicke equates D 331 = NGC 1549, but that seems less likely, as Dunlop's description of two stars involved and a group of stars to the north (near NGC 1549) applies to NGC 1553.  But it is surprising that Dunlop apparently missed NGC 1549.  On his first sweep (5 Dec 1834), John Herschel recorded "vB, R, gmbM, 60", between three stars."

NGC 1554 = Struve's Lost Nebula

04 21 43.5 +19 31 14; Tau


17.5" (11/10/96): at the position of Struve's Lost Nebula (reported by Otto Struve in 1868) is a mag 14 star noted in the observation of NGC 1555 (Hind's Variable Nebula).  This star is 4' WSW of T Tauri and is not involved with nebulosity.


Otto Struve discovered NGC 1554 = "Struve's Lost Nebula" on 14 Mar 1868 with the 15-inch Merz refractor at Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg and placed it 4' WSW of the star T Tauri (which illuminates NGC 1555 = Hind's Variable Nebula).  It was confirmed and measured by Heinrich d'Arrest on 23-25 Mar 1868 after being notified by Struve.  d'Arrest described it, using an 11" refractor at Copenhagen, as "pretty small, nearly round, with an eccentric core like a star of 14th magnitude".  After that date, it was not observed again and may have just been a spurious observation of a close pair of mag 14 and 15.5 stars, considering the fascination at the time with nearby Hind's Variable Nebula.


Dreyer comments in the Notes section of NGC that he was unable to perceive any nebulosity near Struve's position at Birr Castle in 1877 (Lawrence Parsons was previously unsuccessful in 1872, 1876 and 1877) and it was not found by Tempel with the 11-inch Amici refractor at the Arcetri Observatory or Copeland at Dun Echt.  Engelhardt was unsuccessful on 30 Dec 1884 and 8 Jan 1885.  E.E. Barnard and Sherburne Burnham couldn't see it with the 36-inch Lick refractor on 15 Oct 1890.  In the IC 2 notes and corrections section, Dreyer also mentions Struve's nebula was not found by Barnard in 1895 or by James Keeler on plates taken in 1899.


Several sources, including  Sky Catalogue 2000.0 and RNGC, group NGC 1554 and NGC 1555 together as a single object.  NGC 1554 doesn't exist now and Steinicke doubts it ever existed.  The RNGC position for NGC 1554/1555 is 1 min of RA too far east.  Steinicke mentions the nickname "Struve's Lost Nebula" was probably introduced by Cederblad in his 1946 catalogue.

04 21 56.8 +19 32 04; Tau

Size 1'


48" (10/29/19): at 375x, this variable nebula was immediately seen as a diffuse, elongated patch just west of T Tauri.  But the scope was shaking from the wind and the seeing was poor, so details were lacking.


24" (1/12/13): at 200x unfiltered, Hind's Variable Nebula was immediately seen as a very faint, fairly small, elongated haze, roughly 40" in length and slightly curved or bowed out to the west.  The variable reflection nebula seemed unevenly lit, though it was too faint to see any specific details.  This famous nebula is illuminated by T Tauri (mag 10-10.5), just 35" to the east.  T Tauri is perfectly collinear with mag 8.4 HD 27560 5.6' SW and a mag 12 star 4.7' SW.  The nebula has likely brightened since the view in 1996 with my 17.5".


17.5" (11/10/96): this is Hind's Variable (reflection) Nebula, illuminated by T Tauri (9-13).  At 100x and 140x (unfiltered) an extremely faint haze was highly suspected on the west or west-southwest side of T Tauri (mag 9) in the direction of a mag 14 star to the west or slightly south (this star is at the position of NGC 1554 = "Struve's Lost Nebula").  No details in the nebula were visible at 100x (it did not appear as an arc) but a sketch made at 100x exactly matched the orientation of the nebulosity with respect to T Tauri.  Nebulosity was not visible at 220x and no nebulosity was noted following T Tauri.


Hind's Variable Nebula was discovered (along with T Tauri) by John Russell Hind on 11 Oct 1852 with a 7-inch refractor. Because of it's variability, disappearance in the early 1860's, and eventual recovery by Barnard in 1890, it was a subject of fascination and numerous journal reports by most of the major great visual observers of the time including d'Arrest, Tempel, Charconac, Auwers, Secchi, Lassell, Struve, Winnecke, Lawrence Parsons, Dreyer, Barnard and Burnham.


John Russell Hind discovered NGC 1555 = Au 20 = Hind's Variable Nebula, which surrounds the variable star T Tauri, on 11 Oct 1852 with the 7-inch Dollond refractor of George Bishop.  He reported in AN 839 a "very small nebulous-looking object...; it was south-preceding a star of 10th mag, which to my surprise, has escaped insertion on the map for 4h R.A. recently published - possibly it may be variable."  Hind had discovered the young variable T Tauri and the variable reflection nebula NGC 1555.  The following summarizes the visual history of this object as told by Wolfgang Steinicke in his "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters".


Jean Charcornac confirmed the existence of the nebula in 1854 at Marseilles, likely using a 4-inch refractor.  It was probably independently found by James Breen with a 12-inch refractor at Cambridge in 1855.  Heinrich d'Arrest first observed the nebula on 3 Nov 1855 in Leibniz and described "a pretty bright nebula, 4' diameter, star 10 at its northern end" and made several additional observations in 1856. Arthur Auwers made 7 observations between 7 Jan and 3 Mar 1858 with a 4.3-inch refractor.  He noted the nebula "was visible quite easily and without difficulty, but much fainter than it must have been appearing [to d'Arrest] in 1855 and 1856.  He later concluded that it reached its maximum brightness in 1856.  He listed it as #20 in his 1862 catalogue of new nebulae and reported the observations in his notes section.


By 1858, though, there was some fading as Charcornac could not recover it at Paris with the 10-inch refractor.  It was not seen with confidence by Eduard Sch?nfeld in Feb 1861 using the 6.5-inch Steinheil refractor at Mannheim Observatory.  Auwers was unsuccessful in 1861 with a 6-inch Fraunhofer and so was d'Arrest with the 11-inch Merz refractor in 1861-62.  Leverrier and Charcornac failed to see nebulosity with the 12.4-inch refractor at Paris Observatory or the new 31.5-inch silver-on-glass reflector in Jan-Feb 1862.  Father Angelo Secchi also failed in Rome using the 9.4-inch Merz refractor in Jan 1862.  His report suggested a connection between the fading of the variable star and the nebula, shining by reflected light.  William Lassell made an unsuccessful attempt with his 48-inch from Malta in Mar-Apr 1862.  Hind made another attempt on 12 Dec 1863 in excellent conditions, but failed.


The only reported (barely) successful sighting of the nebula during 1861-62 was by Struve and Winnecke using the 15-inch Merz refractor in Pulkovo on 29 Dec 1861 and more easily on 22 Mar 1862, when a sketch was made.  When Struve visited Lassell on Malta, they took a look again on 10 Oct 1863 with the 48-inch and could discern "three or four individual masses separated from each other by black sky", so Struve felt Lassell may have previously looked in the wrong place.  "Hind's wonderful nebula in Taurus" was reported to the general public by Reverend Thomas Webb in 1864 in the popular magazine Intellectual Observer and the same year it was catalogued by John Herschel (who never saw it) as GC 839 and he reported on the history in the Notes section.  In 1865 and 1866, Vogel made several observations (both positive and negative) in Leibniz with 4.6-inch and 6.5-inch refractors and reported very different degrees of visibility.  But during the same time frame and into 1867 it was not seen by Sch?nfeld in Mannheim and was completely invisible to Struve on 14 Mar 1868 at Pulkovo, though he reported a new nebula (Stuve's "Lost Nebula", NGC 1554).  Winnecke made a marginal observation in 1875 and sketched it with certainty in 1877.  Tempel observed the field in 1877, made a map of the region including his and others observations, but apparently included nonexistent stars and nebulosity which he recorded.


Hind's Variable Nebula wasn't seen again until 1890 when it was barely recovered by E.E. Barnard and S.W. Burnham using the Lick 36-inch refractor.  Barnard confirmed a very small, but "conspicuous and definite" glow (only 4" diameter) surrounding T Tauri, which he assumed was NGC 1555, and an excessively faint, round, larger nebula close south that they took as new, but was actually the real NGC 1555.  The larger glow was observed again in 1891 by Burnham in 1891 and by Barnard in February 1895, when he finally realized that the faint object just south of T Tauri was actually Hind's Variable Nebula, (barely) visible again.  But on three attempts in Sep 1895 ("under the finest conditions") he could find no trace of the nebula.  Three years later in Sep 1898, Barnard made additional observations with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor and reported a tiny nebula attached southeast of T Tauri.  The first photograph showing nebulosity was made by Keeler on 6 Dec 1899 and three patches were recorded (two corresponding with Barnard's sketches), but no sign of Struve's Lost Nebula.  Carl Wirtz was unsuccessful in 1906 seeing either NGC 1554 or 1555 in a visual attempt using the 19-inch Merz refractor at Strausberg as well as by S.W. Burnham in 1907 using the 40-inch Yerkes refractor.   Dreyer discussed many of the original visual observations in the NGC, IC 1 and IC 2 Notes section.  In 1936, it was mentioned in the Carnegie Institute Yearbook that NGC 1555 "have been under observation by Baade and Hubble...About 1920 the region of the knot D in Pease's diagram (Mt. Wilson Contributions, No. 127) began to brighten and can now readily be seen in the telescope".  I assume they mean visually in the 100-inch!


Modern sources often group NGC 1554 and 1555 (discovered by Struve) together, although there is no nebulosity visible on the Sky Survey at Struve's position for NGC 1555.  The RNGC RA for NGC 1554 and NGC 1555 is 1.0 min of RA too far east.

NGC 1559 is a member of the NGC 1672 Group in the Dorado Cloud complex that includes NGC 1672, NGC 1688, NGC 1796 and NGC 1703.  Images reveal a number of HII knots, though other than some mottling I didn't note these.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1559 = D 264 = h2634 on 6 Nov 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "faint round nebula, about 40" diameter, slightly bright to the centre; this is north preceding Theta Rhomboidis".   His position, though, is 18' too far south (accurate in RA).  John Herschel observed the galaxy twice but didn't mention an equivalence with D 264, so Dunlop is not credited with the discovery in the GC or NGC.  On his first sweep of 9 Dec 1836, Herschel noted "B, L, mE, vg pmbM; 90" l; 40" br; has a * 14m at the southern edge."


Pietro Baracchi sketched the galaxy on 7 Dec  1885 using the 48" Melbourne Telescope.  His sketch shows the galaxy fading and narrowing at the northeast end and an apparent tiny knot on the south side.

Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1898-99 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes).  RNGC and MCG misidentify IC 2063 = MCG -03-12-005 as NGC 1563.  PGC misidentifies MCG -03-12-005 as NGC 1563 but gives the correct position.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this gorgeous spiral was a showpiece treat even with a 4.5-day moon well up in the west.  NGC 1566 appeared strongly concentrated with a very bright, elongated 1' core region that increased to an intense, round, 20" nucleus.  The two spiral arms were easily visible with direct vision. The "southern" arm is attached on the north side of the core, wrapping around the core counterclockwise on the east side (passing directly between the core and a mag 12 star 2' E of center) and spiraling around 180? to the south side of the halo.  On the south end, the arm passes just north of a mag 15 star and ends at a slightly brighter mag 14.5 star.  The "northern" arm is attached on the south side of the core and wraps around the west side, gradually unfurling towards the north side and ending over 2' NNE of center.


With careful viewing, the northern arm "resolved" into 4 distinct extended HII regions, identified as NGC 1566:[HP80] I, II, IV and VI in Hawley and Phillips 1980 paper "Spectrophotometry of H II regions and the nucleus of NGC 1566" in ApJ, 235, 783.  NGC 1566:[HP80] VI is a 12" knot in the arm, 45" due west of center and is clearly resolved from [HP80] IV, a slightly larger 15" knot which is 50" WNW of center.  [HP80] II is a distinct 10" knot 1' NNW of center and the faintest is [HP80] I, just to its north.  The arm passes just south of a mag 14 star 2' N of center.  With averted vision, the outer halo extends beyond the main arms, increasing the size to 5'x3' SSW-NNE.  Mag 8.7 HD 27713 lies 5.4' NW.  NGC 1566 is the largest and most luminous member of the Dorado Group, which contains three subgroups: NGC 1433 group, NGC 1672 group and NGC 1566 group.


13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): this Seyfert galaxy is a member of the Dorado Group and appears bright, large, elongated 3:2 ~N-S.  With careful viewing the halo extends to ~3'x2'.  A spiral arm is attached on the west side and curves towards the north beyond the main body of the galaxy.  On the eastern side a low surface brightness arm is attached (on an E-W line with a mag 12 star close following the galaxy) and extends a little to the south on the eastern side of the main body.  I was surprised to see the spiral arms so clearly!  Mag 8.2 HD 27713 lies 5.4' NW of center and a mag 9.9 star lies in the field 9' W.  NGC 1581 lies 40' E.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1566 = D 338 = h2635 on 28 May 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta and described "a pretty large round nebula, about 4' diameter, moderately and gradually condensed to the centre. A very small star near the following edge, not involved."  His position is 11' too far south but the identification is certain.


John Herschel observed the galaxy twice from the CGH, recording on 5 Dec 1834, "B, vL, first very gradually then suddenly much brighter to the middle, to a stellar nucleus. Diameter in RA = 15". A star 11th mag involved, N.p. gives it a distorted appearance. A curious object." JH noted this nebula could be Dunlop 338.


Pietro Baracchi observed the galaxy on 7 Dec 1885 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope.  His sketch clearly shows both spiral arms and his description reads "the nebulosity is very faint and has a shape almost like the letter S."

NGC 1568A appeared extremely or very faint, very small, round, 12"-15" diameter, low surface brightness glow with averted vision.  A mag 14.5-15 star is less than 30" N.  On the SDSS, this galaxy has a striking set of tidal tails; it is connected to brighter to NGC 1568B with a delicate, curving bridge and a long tidal plume extends to the northwest.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 1568 = Sw. V-60 on 2 Oct 1886 with his 16" refractor and reported "eF; vS; R; nearly betw 2 stars."  His RA was 21 seconds too large and his comment "nearly betw 2 stars" may apply to two stars 1' northeast and 4' southwest.  Most likely the companion (NGC 1568A) is too faint to be seen by Swift.   Jermain Porter measured an accurate position in 1906 at the Cincinnati Observatory.

48" (10/23/11): at 488x, three very compact knots (luminous super-star clusters) were closely lined up from NW to SE in the central region (total length ~15") with the brightest knot NGC 1569-A in the middle of the trio.  NGC 1569-A was flanked by 1569-C 7" NW and 1569-B 7" SE.  NGC 1569-C appeared very small but was also clearly non-stellar.  NGC 1569-B, very close to the geometric center, was very compact and symmetrical, like a slightly bloated star.  SIMBAD lists a V mag of 15.3 for 1569-A.


18" (1/17/09): at 380x this unusual starburst galaxy appeared as a high surface brightness streak, elongated ~5:2 WNW-ESE.  The brightest region is NW of center and contains two stellar or quasi-stellar knots (super-star clusters) within the glow.  One of these "stars" was fairly easy (NGC 1569-A) and the other was occasionally visible.  A very faint stellar object (SSC NGC 1569-B) is close to the geometric center.  The ESE side of the galaxy is fairly uniform though the position angle is slightly offset.  A mag 9.8 star is less than 1' N of center.


17.5" (3/1/03): at 380x this is a bright, very elongated galaxy with an unusual asymmetric appearance, situated less than 1' S of a mag 9.5 star!  Extended nearly 5:2 NW-SE, 2.0'x0.8'.  The bright core is offset to the NW side of the glow with a tail extending SE, possibly bending at a slight angle to the core.  Two stellar "nuclei" are visible in good seeing.  The brighter "star" is embedded within the core, possibly just slightly north of center.  A second fainter "star" is close SE, near the edge of the core and is visible intermittently.  These "stars" are actually SSC's (luminous super-star clusters).  NGC 1569 was recently determined to be a member of the IC 342 galaxy group.


17.5" (1/12/02): very bright, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, 2.5'x1.1', high but irregular surface brightness with an asymmetric appearance.  The very bright core is mottled and irregular and is offset to the NW side of the galaxy!  At 380x, there are two stellar "nuclei" within this glow.  The brighter stellar nucleus is fairly easy and a fainter stellar point is close SE.  There is also a strong impression of a third stellar spot close west of the central nucleus.  These faint "stars" are actually luminous super-star clusters, the most massive known type of star clusters (color image at http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/papers/n1569hst.html).  A mag 10 star is close off the north side, 1' from center and a mag 13 star is just off the SE end.


13.1" (1/18/85): very bright, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, high surface brightness, elongated bright core, mottling suspected.  Located just 1' S of a mag 10 star.


8" (11/28/81): fairly bright, small, elongated.  Located just south of a mag 9 star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1569 = H II-768 on 4 Nov 1788 (sweep 881) and noted "pB, S, lE, BN, just south of a pretty bright star."  Ralph Copeland observed this galaxy on 17 Jan 1873 using Lord Rosse's 72" and recorded, "Decidedly cometic in appearance, with the head north-preceding.  Position of elongation 111.2?.  Has an 11 mag reddish star in PA 359?, Dist 45".  This star is the south member of a double star.  There is also a 15m star following in the direction of the axis of the nebula.  This object, although of the second class, is 3 or 4x as bright as H I-258 [NGC 1491]."

18" (11/26/03): at 115x, appears a very large, scattered field with a number of brighter stars.  There are no denser regions of fainter stars to distinguish this as a cluster although the star density drops rapidly to the west (edge of Milky Way?).  Most distinctive is a stream of bright stars which extends 20' SW of the cluster's position and includes a number of mag 8-10 stars.  The string begins with mag 8.7 SAO 39581 and includes a 16" pair of mag 10 stars as well as mag 8.6 SAO 39578.  The classification of this group as a true cluster is doubtful.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1582 = H VIII-70 on 3 Feb 1788 (sweep 801) and logged "a cluster of coarsely scattered large stars, pretty rich, 20 or 25' diameter."

On the DSS, this is an unusual (multiple?) galaxy (PGC 15285 and 15292) with two off-center knots or condensations, one on the east end!  A perfect parallelogram of stars with sides 3'x1' lies 5' SE (brightest stars mag 10 on the south side).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1592 = h2645 on 29 Dec 1834 and recorded "vF; vS."  He only observed this object on one sweep and the declination is given as uncertain.  There is nothing at his position and Herbert Howe reported in 1898 that "in the place given for this I found only small stars. 1591, near by, was observed".


RC3 identifies ESO 421-002 as NGC 1592, although this galaxy is 27' S (correct in RA) of Herschel's position.  Given the uncertainly in his declination, this seems a likely candidate.  Neither MCG nor ESO label ESO 421-002 as NGC 1592.  RNGC classifies this number nonexistent.

NGC 1608 was found by Lawrence Parsons, using Lord Rosse's 72", on 1 Jan 1876, though his position is also poor.  Finally, Stephane Javelle (III-988) independently found the galaxy again on 15 Jan 1898 with the 30" refractor at Nice, reported J. 3-988 (later IC 2077) with an accurate micrometric position.

Bigourdan (260) independently found this galaxy on 17 Jan 1895 while searching for NGC 1594 at Swift's position, placed it accurately, and it was catalogued again as IC 2075.

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 1608 on 1 Jan 1876 and reported "about 1m 44s +/- following and 3.5' south [of NGC 1587/1588] is a pF, cS stellar neb, with a *12 mag 117" south.  His position is 10' NE of  UGC 3082 = PGC 15447 and the "*12 mag 117" south" is 1.7' north.  Albert Marth (m 97) earlier discovered this galaxy on 7 Nov 1863 and Dreyer catalogued this galaxy as GC(S) 5342 and NGC 1593, but Marth's position was exactly 1.0 min of RA too far west, so the observations seemed to apply to different objects.   FInally, Stephane Javelle independently found the galaxy on 15 Jan 1898 and he (as well as Kobold at Strasbourg) measured an accurate position for J. 3-988 (later IC 2077). So, NGC 1608 = NGC 1593 = IC 2077.  UGC, MCG and CGCG label the galaxy IC 2077, though NGC 1593 refers to the earliest visual observation.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, notes NGC 1608 = IC 2077.  Discussed in Malcolm Thomson's Catalogue Corrections.

See observing notes for NGC 1599.  The NGC identification is very uncertain.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1610 = LM 2-396 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at Leavenworth's position and it was reported as "not revealed with 60 min exposure" at the Helwan Observatory (1935).


The RNGC identifies PGC 15543 at 04 34 13.9 -04 41 59 (2000) as NGC 1610.  Leavenworth's position is 81 seconds of RA west and 7' north of PGC 15543 (not an unusual error in RA, but the declination in the L-M lists are generally fairly accurate).  Corwin suggests NGC 1610 may be a duplicate observation of NGC 1599.  This galaxy is ~1 minute of RA west of Leavenworth's position, a common error.  But Corwin notes this galaxy has a bright star 1.1' ENE which would probably have been mentioned by Leavenworth.

17.5" (1/23/93): very faint, small, round, weak concentration, low surface brightness.  Located 3.1' SSW of a mag 10.5 star.  IC 382 lies 30' WSW.  Misidentified in the RNGC as IC 382.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 1632 = LM 2-399 in 1886 at the Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 15.0, 0.2' dia, R."  There is nothing at his position, but 0.8 min of RA east is PGC 15769.  As the L-M positions are generally only off in RA, this identification is likely.  Javelle found this galaxy again on 6 Feb 1893, measured an accurate position for J. 2-601 (later IC 386), so probably NGC 1632 = IC 386.  RNGC and NGC 2000.0 identify IC 382 as NGC 1632. Although IC 382 is brighter than IC 386, it is 4' off in declination and so less likely to be Muller's object.  See Corwin's notes.

48" (11/2/13): bright, large, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, 3'x2.5'.  Contains a large bright core with an elongated bright nucleus that appears to be a bar oriented E-W.  The appearance is quite irregular due a thick, fairly prominent spiral arm that curves north-south along the eastern side of the halo and bending west as it curves counterclockwise on the north side.  A darker gap was evident between the slightly brighter inner edge of this thick arm and the core.  A small section of another spiral arm is attached at the SW side of the core.  The SW side of the halo is fainter and not as extensive as the NE side, so the galaxy has a lopsided appearance.


13.1" (12/18/82): fairly faint, large, diffuse, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, weak concentration.  A mag 13 star is 2.1' NE of center.  Located midway between Mu Eridani (V = 4.0) 1? ESE and 51 Eridani (V = 5.2) 1? WNW.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1637 = H I-122 = h327 on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518) and reported "cB, vL, iR, bM, easily resolvable, 5' or 6' diameter." John Herschel made two observations from Slough, England ? once describing it as "bright" and another time as "pretty faint".  Fifteen observations were made at Birr Castle and noted as a spiral on 19 Dec 1848 (included in the LdR's 1850 list of "Spiral or curvilinear" nebulae).  R.J. Mitchell, observing on 26 Dec 1856, added "Suspect very strongly that it is a right handed spiral, but the outlying neby is vF."  He made a sketch two nights later (LdR's 1861 publication, Plate XXV, figure 9).


Albert Le Sueur sketched it using the 48" Melbourne Telescope with an elongated core (WSW-ENE) offset to the south side (halo more extensive to the north) and subtle structure in the halo (unpublished plate VII, figure 83).  It was later observed by both Joseph Turner and Pietro Baracchi (11 Mar 1885).

Size 9"/15"


24" (12/22/14): this close triple star was viewed at 260x and 375x. It is easy to see how this triple could be mistaken for a nebula at lower power or in soft seeing.  At times, the closer 9" pair nearly blended together or the fainter component appeared as a faint glow off the east side of the brighter component.  The 14.5-15th magnitude southern component (at 12"-15") was always cleanly split.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1639 = h2655 on 10 Dec 1835 and remarked "eF; vS; R; between 2 stars."  At his position is a triple star as reported in 1898 by Herbert Howe using the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory, "I find no nebula, but simply an equilateral triangle of 12.5 mag stars."  The closer pair is ~9" separation, with a 3rd star at 15".

His rough position (nearest min of RA) is 1.5 tmin west of ESO 551-027 (typical error), but his noted "E 40?" secures the identificiation.  Stone later measured an accurate micrometric position with the 26".  Steinicke states this galaxy is the brightest galaxy discovered at Leander McCormick Observatory.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): large, scattered group of a dozen mag 10.5 to 13.5 stars and another dozen stars down to mag 15, in roughly a 10' region.  No central concentration or rich subgroups, though detached in the field so stands out reasonably well.  Still, this is a very poor "cluster" considering its size.  Some catalogues have misidentified NGC 1641 with a close pair of galaxies on the east side of the group.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1641 = h2656 on 2 Dec 1834 and remarked " pL; p rich; irreg R; p m comp; 5'; stars 11...16".  His position is on the southeast side of a scattered group of stars, roughly 10' across.


Pietro Baracchi searched unsuccessfully for this object a couple of times in Dec 1885 using the 48" Melbourne telesocpe.  Shapley and Lindsay (S-L 6) give a diameter of only 20" and notes "NGC 1641? irregularly resolved", but this refers to the double system ESO 84-25, which happens to be close to Herschel's position.  Clearly, Herschel's description applies to the larger star group and not these galaxies, so the listing in S-L is erroneous.  The Hodge-Wright Atlas of the LMC also labels the ESO galaxies as NGC 1641.  RNGC classifies this number as an open cluster, but references S-L, and NGC 2000.0 references the RNGC.  The identifications were sorted out by Jenni Kay in an email dated Dec 13, 1998.

With averted vision a very low surface brightness halo increases the size to roughly 40"x25" NNW-SSE.  Occasionally an extremely faint stellar or quasi-stellar object briefly popped on the SSE edge of the halo.

The identification of NGC 1649 is disputed.  It may refer to the small cluster described above or more likely NGC 1649 is a duplicate observation of NGC 1652.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1649 = h2660 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "F; R; gbM; 30"."  His position is 9' S of h2661 = NGC 1652, which he observed on 3 sweeps, but not on the single sweep that NGC 1649 was recorded.  Harold Corwin concludes NGC 1649 is likely a duplicate of NGC 1652 based on the similar descriptions and a possible 10' digit error in declination.  The Hodge-Wright LMC Atlas states "possibly NGC 1652" (no object is indicated) and ESO equates NGC 1649 = NGC 1652.  NGC 1649 is classified as nonexistent in Mati Morel's "A Visual Atlas of the LMC".  Eric Lindsay, in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" [1964IrAJ....6..286L], states "Not found. Centered on CPD -69?284. Possibly the faint cluster S/L 8, 13' south."


Robert Innes, at the Union Observatory in 1927, suggested a 6 minute error in RA and equal to NGC 1676.  But Jenni Kay suggest NGC 1649 is a small cluster (ESO 55-031 = KMHK 22) just 2.3' NNW of Herschels positon for NGC 1649.  The visual appearance in a 30-inch is given in my notes, but it is probably too faint to have caught Herschel's attention.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this gorgeous barred spiral appeared very bright and large with the main body elongated E-W, extending ~3.5'x2.0'.  An obvious spiral arm is attached at the east end of the E-W central bar.  This arm hooks to the north, wrapping around a superimposed star to the northeast of the bar (1.6' from the center).  Three fainter stars with separations ~30" are sandwiched to the west of this star, between the arm and the bar. The arm fades out before reaching a mag 10 star 2.2' NE of center.  A second arm begins to emerge on the west side of the bar, barely sweeping towards the south before abruptly terminating.  So the second "arm" is just a small hooking appendage off the west end.  The central bar itself is sharply concentrated with a dramatic, brilliant nucleus, ~25" diameter, that increases gradually to the center.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this striking spiral galaxy appeared fairly bright and large, ~4' diameter, sharply concentrated with a very bright core.  Clearly emerging from the east side of the oval core or bar was a spiral arm which curled north and wrapped around two stars to the NW of the core.  The extension on the west side was just a very faint, diffuse haze on the SW side without a sharply defined arm structure.  A mag 9 star is 6.5' ENE and a mag 6.5 star (HD 30790) is 13' NE.


13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, ~3'x2'.  Sharply concentrated with a very small, bright core, ~20" diameter, and a large oval halo.  Spiral structure was evident as an ill-defined extension or haze off the NE side, though I could not resolve this spiral arm clearly.  Situated directly between two mag 9 stars 10' SW and 6.5' ENE.  Located 30' NNE of mag 5.3 Kappa Doradus.  This galaxy is a member of the Dorado group, which includes NGC 1515, NGC 1533, NGC 1536, NGC 1543, NGC 1546, NGC 1553, NGC 1566, NGC 1574, NGC 1596, NGC 1617 and IC 2056.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1672 = D 296 on 5 Nov 1826 and described "a faint ill-defined nebula, with a small bright point in the preceding side, which I suspect to be a star; there are several similar small stars in the field."  His position was off by 15' to the NW.  John Herschel, who made two observations of this barred spiral, was uncertain if D 296 was equivalent to h2665.  On the first sweep he logged "B, L, pmE, svmbM to a nucleus; 2.5' long, 1.5' broad; a star 12th mag involved."  His position was accurate.

He drew it boomerange shaped with one side between the mag 12 star at the north edge and the 13th mag star on the east side (central part of galaxy) and a second side beginning at the mag 13 star extending southwest (this section is an irregular spiral arm).  He also sketched nebulosity south of the 12th mag star. (p. 150 in logbook).

Lewis Swift found NGC 1689 = Sw. V-65 on 22 Oct 1886 with the 16" refractor at the Warner Observatory.  There is nothing at his position and Herbert Howe reported "I searched for it on two nights [with the 20" refractor at Denver] without success.  Probably there was an error of just 5 min in its RA, and it is identical with 1667 [found earlier by Stephan in 1884], which has the same declination.  Swift made the same 5 minute error in RA on the same sweep with NGC 1677 = Sw. V-64, which is identical to NGC 1659.   RNGC classifies this number as "not found" (from Dorothy Carlson's paper).

17.5" (2/14/99): this is a compact group of four mag 13.5-14.5 stars within 30".  Easily picked up at 220x and three close stars visible.  At 280x, this multiple star is cleanly resolved in moments of good seeing.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1707 = h338 on 8 Jan 1828 (sweep 118) and described a "resolved nebula or a small round group of very small stars, 30" diameter."  There is nothing at his position but 30 seconds of RA west is a group of four to five stars and R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" in 1854, called it "only a group of 4 or 5 stars."  Bigourdan apparently couldn't find NGC 1707 at JH's position and claimed it as new --  B. 381 (later IC 2107).  He noted, "cl, vF, vS, R".  So, this multiple star has both a NGC and IC designation!  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

Surprisingly, this scattered group is fairly well detached in the field and appears visually to be a cluster.  Includes a number of mag 10.5-11.5 stars.  The group is unconcentrated and most of the stars are situated along the perimeter with two large starless interior regions (larger one on the south side).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1708 = h337 on 16 Feb 1831 (sweep 327) and described a "v Loose, pRi, fills field, the largest *10m, mixed magnitudes."  The mag 10 star in h's description appears to be 30 tsec further east at 05 03 26.3 +52 52 31 (J2000).  RNGC classifies this number as a nonexistent cluster.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1710 = LM 1-140 on 14 Nov 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is less than 1 min of RA following MCG -03-13-037 = PGC 16396, so this identification is secure.  Ormond Stone later measured an accurate position.  Bigourdan was misled by Leavenworth's poor position and identified a faint star as NGC 1710.  He assumed Big. 296 (later IC 2108), found on 9 Dec 1896, was new.  But his position matches  MCG -03-13-037, so IC 2108 = NGC 1710.  Corwin notes that Bigourdan realied the equivalence in his own large table of micrometric measurements.  MCG labels the galaxy as IC 2108 and ignores the NGC designation.  See Corwin's notes.

George Johnstone Stoney discovered NGC 1717 on 15 Jan 1849 while observing the presumed field of h340 [= NGC 1719].  In the 1861 LdR publication, the description for h340 simply notes a "nova" near (2 observations claimed) and John Herschel added a single LdR nova to the GC.  In the 1880 monograph, the description states "3 vF nebulae" and a very small diagram shows 3 nebulae (no arrow for west), two separated by 3.5' and a third separated by 10' from the larger of the pair.  But only a single nebula was found again in 3 subsequent observations of NGC 1719 at Birr Castle.


While preparing the 1880 monograph, Dreyer added the note (in brackets) "The two upper ones are probably h339 & 340 [NGC 1709 & 1713]" and noted the third "nebula" could possibly be a mag 13-14 star recorded by d'Arrest 4.7 sec preceding and 80" north of NGC 1719.  A mag 13 star is at d'Arrest's exact offset from NGC 1719 and the UGC notes section equates NGC 1717 with this star.  RNGC equates NGC 1717 with NGC 1719 and MCG labels NGC 1719 as NGC 1717.


Yann Pothier suggests the 3 nebulae in the sketch are NGC 1709, NGC 1713 (the closer pair) and the third nebula is CGCG 394-056.  Assuming west is to the left on the diagram, these three galaxies are a pretty good match, though CGCG 394-055 is just 1.4' from -056, which is another possibility.  A visual observation might help decide.  See Corwin's identification notes.

George R?mker discovered NGC 1724 (his only NGC "discovery") on 30 Apr 1864 while observing stars for the Hamburg catalogue with a 10-cm meridian-circle refractor by Fraunhofer.  R?mker marked a "nebula" on the Hamburg star catalogue and his position corresponds with a small trio of mag 11/12 stars at a central position of 05 03 33 +49 29.5 (2000).  Auwers couldn't find Rumker's nebula and Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, described NGC 1724 as "3 pF st; BD +49d1292 nff."  Lynga considered it a doubtful OC (OCL-405) and RNGC classified this number as nonexistent.

E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 1725, along with NGC 1721 and 1728, on 10 Nov 1885 at Nashville with the 6-inch refractor at Vanderbilt University (see description under NGC 1721).


Lewis Swift observed the trio (Sw. III-32, III-33 and III-34) a month later on 2 Dec 1885 after being notified by Barnard, but he mistakenly reported them as new again in his third discovery list, published in 1886!  Barnard immediately responded in AN 2755 to claim prior discovery and Swift noted this trio was previously discovered by Barnard in the errata to his 5th list. Sherburne Burnham's corrected RA (Publications of Lick Observatory, II) is accurate.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, fairly large, irregular patch, ~2.5'x1.5', with at least a half-dozen mag 13 stars resolved.  This LMC cluster with nebulosity (N79E) responded well to a UHC filter at 128x.  The western section is catalogued as LMC-N79C.  A small extension was visible to the southeast consisting of cluster KMHK 187 (no stars were resolved) and LMC-N79D, increasing the size to ~3.5'x1.5'.  NGC 1727 is in a group with NGC 1722 4' SW and NGC 1712 7.5' SW. Located 4' N of mag 8.5 HD 31722.  This is a very young cluster or association (LH 2) with an unevolved main sequence similar to nearby NGC 1722.


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x and UHC filter this is a fairly large elongated patch of nebulosity, ~3.5' diameter with a group of mag 12-13 stars superimposed.  A smaller detached piece of nebulous haze, ~1' diameter, is close southeast.  This is the 3rd (and 4th) in a chain of objects with NGC 1722 4.5' SW and NGC 1712 8' SW.  A mag 8.5 star (HD 31722) is 4' SSE.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 1727 = D 113 in 1826 with his 9" reflector and described "a small faint nebula; 12" or 15" diameter."  He made a single observation and his position is 19' SSE of this nebulous cluster.   Because of the poor match in position and simple description, this identification is very uncertain.  JH made three observations of h2690 beginning on 3 Nov 1834, when he noted "a rather poor irreg R cluster. (Sky Hazy)".  On a second sweep he recorded "A cluster, pB, pmE, 3' l, 90" br; stars 12m"  His last description says "The third of a series of clustering patches. Oval."  Herschel did not reference Dunlop's possible earlier observation.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1730 = LM 1-141 = LM 1-142 = Sw. V-66 on 12 Nov 1885.  Leavenworth called it a double nebula with separation 10" in PA 110?, but there is only a single galaxy with a faint star superimposed.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is accurate in declination and a good match in RA.  Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy on 9 Oct 1886 and reported it as new in his 5th list with a very accurate position (used in the NGC).  Frank Muller noted the equivalence of Sw. V-66 with Leavenworth's object in a Sidereal Messenger article (Feb 1887) that listed nebulae from Swift's 5th catalogue which had been discovered previously.  As a result, Dreyer only assigned a single NGC designation.  But apparently Barnard found the galaxy again and notified Dreyer directly and it was catalogued again as IC 2113. Barnard's position is nearly identical to Swift's so Dreyer simply missed the earlier discovery.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this is a large region of nebulosity (LHa 120-N4, a confirmed supernova remnant) and scattered stars (association LH 4), 6'-7' diameter.  The double star h3710 = 10.7/12.7 at 12" is involved on the east side, along with a number of fainter stars.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright, very small, 20"-24" diameter.  At first glance looks like a double star oriented NW-SE embedded in some surrounding haze. But with a careful examination one of the "stars" is clearly bloated (perhaps has very close companions) and appears as a very small high surface brightness glow.  NGC 1734 lies 7.3' SSE.


LMC Supernova remnant N86 lies 14' E.   This observation is from the 2017 OzSky star party:

25" (10/17/17): at 244x; this LMC supernova remnant appeared unfiltered as a large, low surface brightness hazy region, just south of a mag 11.8 star.  A couple of 14th mag stars appear involved with the haze.  This mag 11.8 star forms the eastern vertex of an isosceles triangle with a mag 11.5 star 5.6' NW and a mag 10.0 star 6' SW.  There was a weak contrast gain adding a NPB filter, with the most evident section ~1' diameter [centered 1.2' S of the mag 11.8 star] and slightly brighter on the east side.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1732 = h2694 on 23 Dec 1834 and described "a small double star first class [HJ 3712] in centre of a S, R, nebula."  Joseph Turner made a sketch with the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate II, figure 19) showing a double star within a small patch of nebulosity. Observing in 1926 with the 26-inch refractor of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, Robert Innes called it a "5 arc second double star in the foci of an elliptical nebula."

In addition I logged three clusters not plotted on the Morel Atlas: KMHK 193 4.7' WSW, KMHK 189 6.9' SW and S-L 75 9.7' SSW.  The S-L cluster was brighter and larger than many NGC objects in the LMC.  At 200x it appeared moderately bright and large, round, 45"-50" diameter, broad concentration, no resolution.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1735 = h2696 on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded "F, vS, R; has two or three stars appended."  On a later sweep he called it "pB,S, R; has two stars appended forming an arc with the nebula."


Joseph Turner sketched the cluster on 13 Nov 1876 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 20 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_20.php).  Turner called the nebula faint and at times sparkling, possbily caused by the presence of three stars.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this is a bright, relatively large, crescent-shaped nebulosity involving 4 stars, ~1.2'x0.8', stretching NNW to SSE.  On the east side, four stars were resolved in an 0.8' curving arc that followed the shape of the nebula!  The two brighter mag 13.5 stars are on the south end of the string and two mag 14.5 and 15 stars are just north.  In addition, a couple of very faint stars are off the southwest side.  I didn't compare the view using a filter.  Located ~9' E of a 2' pair of bright stars: mag 6.8 HD 31532 and mag 8.4 HD 31576.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1736 = h2697 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "B; R; resolvable" on his single observation.  There is nothing at his position, but Robert Innes suggested h2697 was probably identical to a "nebulous patch north-preceding a 12 mag star", located 1 min of RA west of JH's position.  Henize (Catalogues of Hydrogen Alpha Emission Stars and Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds, Astrophysical Journal Supplement 2, 1956, p315), also noted LHa N120-8 is "Probably NGC 1736. The NGC description suits the object but the position is 1 minute in error." He reported, "1.4' east-west and 1.9' north-south. It has a slightly irregular outline, is not elongated and has appreciable structure. Two 12.8 mag exciting stars are involved."  Eric Lindsay, in his 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289), repeated the "NGC position in error and should be 1m [West] where there is a bright round patch of nebulosity not listed in the NGC. This is Henize N8 and noted by Henize to be probably NGC 1736 with 1m error."  JH caught several typos of this type and corrected them in an errata list, but missed this one.


Joseph Turner observed and sketch this object on 11 Nov 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope. In 1885 Barachi noted, "Small, round, bright, about 202 2 ; edge rather ill-defined, not sharp; sparkling at times; may be a little cluster, but could not make certain with any power."

He next saw it as "bright, round, resolvable; No. 2 in a group of four forming a sort of lozenge." The four objects he refers to are NGC 1737, 1743, 1745 and 1748.


Joseph Turner sketched these four nebulous clusters on 13 Nov 1876 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 22).  The orientation of the objects is not very good (even if north is not at the top) and NGC 1743 is shown as a very elongated, curvy nebulosity oriented N-S.  Pietro Baracchi's sketch on 13 Nov 1884 appears to show NGC 1743 in two sections; the northern part elongated elongated NW-SE and ending near NGC 1737 and the southern part has a comet-like appearance surrounding a star.  In a short report by Ellery in The Observatory, 9, 204, he mentions that NGC 1737, 1743, 1745 and 1748 appeared to show distinct differences, not only since John Herschel's time, but between Turner's and Baracchi's observations.


The gaseous nature of NGC 1743 was first found by Annie Jump Cannon on spectrum plates taken at Harvard's Arequipa station in 1897 and was catalogued as HD 31947.  NGC 1743 is misclassified as an planetary nebula on the Skalnate Pleso "Atlas of the Heavens" as well as the Sky Atlas 2000.0 based on the HD spectral class.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1744 = h2692 and called "vF, vL, vmE, vgvlbM, 4' long, 2.5' broad."  His position is ~35 sec of RA too far east, but the identification is certain based on the description.


Joseph Turner sketched this galaxy on 11 Dec 1876 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 23 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_23.php).  He found the nebula much elongated ~N-S, length about 2' 20" and much fainter than expected.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1745 = h2702 on 11 Nov 1836 and logged "faint, small, No 3 in a group of 4. Place estimated from No. 2." The four objects are NGC 1737, 1743, 1745 and NGC 1748.  Joseph Turner sketched the group in Nov. 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  See plate III.22 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_22.php.

17.5" (2/22/87): very bright, very large, large range of magnitudes, spread out overall but locally rich in a few spots.  Includes two main subgroups - NGC 1750 and NGC 1758 - which are probably the only clusters here, along with several mag 7.5-8.5 stars.  NGC 1750 consists of two dozen stars on the south side.  It appears as a fairly large oval oriented NW-SE with a void in the center and includes a nice mag 9.1/9.1 pair at 20".  NGC 1758 is a richer, roundish group of stars close northeast (though probably unrelated physically to NGC 1950) including about two dozen stars.  NGC 1758 is bracketed by two mag 8 stars oriented N-S and a mag 7 star is off the east end.  Includes five mag 13 stars at the east side.


NGC 1746, although often applied to the 40' field including NGC 1750 and 1758, may in fact be a duplicate of NGC 1750 or just a group of faint field stars noted by d'Arrest while searching for NGC 1750.


13.1" (12/22/84): about 100 stars in 20' field.  The brightest mag 7 star (HD 32461) at the south edge and there are many nearby bright stars.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 1746 on 9 Nov 1863 with an 11" refractor while searching for NGC 1750 and called it a poor cluster.  His position was roughly 10' north of William Herschel's position for NGC 1750 = H. VIII-43 though d'Arrest refers to his "cluster" as H VIII-43.  NGC 1746 is often applied to the entire 40' field including NGC 1750 and 1758 on the east side but Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1746 may indeed be a duplicate of NGC 1750 or perhaps just a group of  stars on the north edge of NGC 1750.  In any case, it is not a separate cluster from NGC 1750 and 1759, although I've retained the position and size often found in observing books and atlases.

Without the filter the cluster consists of a number of mag 12 and fainter stars that huddle around the bright star.  On the DSS, the emission component (N9) is a nearly complete large bubble of 5'-6' in diameter (open on the NE end) with the bright star in the interior to the southwest of center.  The stellar component is part of association LH 6.  NGC 1735 lies 6.5' NW and NGC 1774 is 17' ESE.

25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 244x + NPB filter; fairly bright but fairly small round patch (N83B) with a high surface brightness and a diameter of ~30".  At 397x, a 13th mag "star" (N83B-1) was resolved at the southeast edge.  This star is classified as a high excitation H II blob [HEB].  According to Iranian-born astronomer Mohammed Heydari-Malayeri, these unusual objects represent "early stages of massive stars emerging from their embryonic molecular clouds".  Unfiltered a second star (mag ~13.5) is involved closer to the center, forming a 7" double with the HEB.  NGC 1748 is in a group of interesting nebulae with NGC 1743 2' SW, NGC 1745 1.5' N and NGC 1737 2.5' WNW.  Also NGC 1756 (populous blue cluster) is 4' SE.


24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this HII region (LMC-N83B) appeared as a bright, small, high surface bright knot in a striking group of nebulae, 20" diameter.  A couple of stars are involved in the bright glow.  A mag 10.3 star is 1.9' SW.  NGC 1743 lies 2' SW


John Herschel discovered NGC 1748 = h2704 on 11 Nov 1836 and reported "pB, vS, R, No. 4 in a group of 4."  The other three objects are NGC 1737, 1743, 1745.  According to Harold Corwin, IC 2114 = Fleming 86, discovered by Williamina Fleming on a Harvard objective prism plate taken at the Arequipa station in 1901, is probaby the bright knot at the east edge that is classified as a HEB -- or "High Excitation Blob".


Joseph Turner sketched the nebular complex in Nov. 1876 using the Great Melbourne Telescope.  See plate III.22 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_22.php.  He mentioned a small star in the centre. See notes on NGC 1743.

NGC 1758 is close NE (though probably physically unrelated ).  Modern catalogues apply NGC 1746 to the entire cluster (see description), although NGC 1750 (from William Herschel) and NGC 1746 (from d'Arrest) are either identical or just parts of the same cluster.


13": group of fainter stars, just SE of open cluster NGC 1746.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1750 = H VIII-43, along with NGC 1758, on 26 Dec 1785 (sweep 493) and described a "A cl of very coarsely scattered L *, joining to the following [VII 21 = NGC 1758] I believe."  His position indicates NGC 1750 is the large, elongated group of stars centered at 05 03 55 +23 39.5, just southwest of NGC 1758.  Although NGC 1750 is generally taken as a subgroup (on the SE side) of much larger NGC 1746, Corwin suggests that Heinrich d'Arrest's NGC 1746, which was found while searching for NGC 1750, is actually a duplicate of NGC 1750.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, states that NGC 1750 is the central group in a very large cluster also containing NGC 1746 and NGC 1758.

Two mag 15-15.5 stars were resolved at the edges and a couple of extremely faint mag 16-16.5 stars were occasionally resolved within the main glow.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1751 = D 78 = h2705 on 24 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector and described as "a small faint nebula, about 15" diameter, with a minute star slightly involved in the south side." His position is 12' ESE of this cluster.  though this observation was missed by JH when compiling the GC.  Dunlop's position is 12' ESE of the cluster.  JH independently discovered this cluster on 12 Nov 1836 and logged "extremely faint, irregularly round; 2' diameter".


According to Wolfgang Steinicke, this is the faintest (at V = 14.5) of Dunlop's discoveries but it was much more prominent visually (described as a "fairly bright" using Zane Hammond's 24").  Also, 1996ApJS..102...57 gives V = 11.7, so Steinicke's magnitude may be from an erroneous source (same mag repeated in DOCdb).

A 1992 article "Probable open clusters NGC 1750 and NGC 1758 behind the Taurus dark clouds" (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992BaltA...1..125S0) concludes that NGC 1758 and NGC 1750 may be true open clusters are different distances and a 1999 article (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1002118814371?LI=true) arrives at the same conclusion.  Another 1998 article "The Overlapping Clusters NGC 1750 and NGC 1758" in A&AS, 333, 471 concluded there was at least 1 cluster in the area (but could not conclude it was a double cluster) and that NGC 1746 was not a cluster.  Finally, in a Feb 2005 S&T article, James Kaler states that "N1750 and N1758 are probably two different clusters separated along our line of sight by 500 light years, but they appear to fall almost directly atop each other"

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): appears as a 1.7' E-W string of a half-dozen stars over fairly bright nebulosity.  The emission haze is brightest just south of the string and extending to the west of the string a couple of arc minutes.  Irregular nebulosity also branches out to the south of the string for another 2' and involves a mag 12 star.  Another 2' string of N-S stars is on the west side of the haze.


NGC 1760 is at the SW end of a stunning complex (LHA 120-N11)  of clusters and nebulosity including NGC 1763 = Bean Nebula, a showpiece nebula and cluster centered 7' NE; NGC 1761, a larger cluster and nebulosity just 3' N; NGC 1769, a bright emission nebula 8' NE; along with NGC 1773, NGC 1776 and IC 2115.  Lucke and Hodge assign NGC 1760 and 1761 to the stellar association LH 9.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): very faint, small, elongated 1' strip of nebulosity just 3' S of NGC 1761. One or two involved stars were barely resolved.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1760 = h2709 on 20 Dec 1835 and described "a very faint, small nebula, with three very small stars involved.  Place deduced not from a sweep but from a drawing carefully made of its configuration with the neighbouring nebula, especially of the cluster [NGC 1761]."  Steinicke attributes James Dunlop with the discovery (D 231), but I don't believe this group of stars is obvious enough to have been picked up with his 9" speculum reflector.


NGC 1760 was recorded in "Observations of the Southern Nebulae made with the [48"] Great Melbourne Telescope". In November 1884, Baracchi wrote, "Very faint, small, roundish, three stars in it, 16th or 17th magnitude. Agrees exactly with H[erschel]. and T[urner]. No stars in the field. Three stars involved are not shown distinctly in the lithograph. They really appear as three distinct stars involved in very faint roundish nebula, whereas lithograph shows bright nebula with stars too diffused and uncertain."  His sketch identifies GC 979 as the elongated strip just south of NGC 1771 with 3 embedded stars, though Joseph Turner sketched the entire complex between 17 Apr and 21 Apr in 1879.  Turner's sketch shows the E-W string of stars but a round nebula to the SW, matching the position of LMC-N11I, is identified as NGC 1760.

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): bright, large cluster sandwiched between the showpiece Bean Nebula (NGC 1763) to the north and NGC 1760 to the south.  The cluster contains roughly 80 stars mag 11 to 16 in a 3.5' irregularly shaped group over some background haze.  The stars are fairly even distributed except for a detached 1.3' group of 10-12 stars off the NW side.  Including this detached section, the overall size of this star cloud (association LH 9) is 5'x3.5'. It?s the central cluster in the N11 Superbubble.


On the northwest side of the main cluster is HD 32228 = Brey 9, a compact knot containing at least 16 early-type stars including a Wolf-Rayet star (type WC5 with dominant carbon emission) and an O9-type star.  Visually I noted Brey 9 as a close bright double star (h3716 = 11.7/12.4 at 5").


25" (4/4/19): at 244x; Brey 9 was a fairly bright compact knot on the northwest side of NGC 1761. It had a high surface brightness and ~5" diameter.  A faint star was attached at the edge forming a "double".


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this rich group of very faint stars is located just south of the south end of the HII region/cluster NGC 1763.  On the west side is a quasi-stellar mag 10 object and the cluster is elongated E-W, 2'x1'.  On the west side of the brighter star is another small group of faint stars and haze which may be a continuation of the cluster.


James Dunlop was probably the discoverer of NGC 1761 = D 231 on 6 Nov 1826, recording "a faint round nebula, 1' diameter."  His position is 15' too far south, a typical error.  This identification is reasonable, assuming D 230 applies to NGC 1763 (Bean Nebula), although Steinicke applies D 230 to NGC 1760, a much less obvious object.


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 1761= h2710 on 11 Dec 1835 and recorded the "chief star 9th mag in a large loose cluster." He made 3 observations as well as including it on a sketch (Plate III, fig 3), along with NGC 1760, 1763 and 1769.  Joseph Turner sketched the entire complex as well in Apr 1879 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  NGC 1761 is shown as elongated E-W with a number of stars superimposed, particularly around the edges.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1762 = H III-453 on 8 Oct 1785 (sweep 462) and logged "vF, vS, 240 confirmed it."  Caroline Herschel made an error in reducing his offset in RA and his published position was 10 tmin of RA too far west.  Coincidentally, that placed it close to UGC 3198.  When John Herschel observed this galaxy, he equated his h335 with H. III-453.  JH sorted out the mistake when compiling the GC. The NGC dec was 3' too far north.

04 56 45 -66 24 36; Dor

Size 5'x3'


30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): The Bean Nebula complex (LHA 120-N11) is the second largest stellar nursery in the LMC after the Tarantula Nebula.  The showpiece object is NGC 1763, which sits near the center of a stunning field of emission nebulae and clusters including NGC 1760 7' S, NGC 1761 3' S, NGC 1769 6.5' SE, NGC 1773 8' ENE and NGC 1776 11' E.  NGC 1763 is a very bright, very large irregular nebula, shaped like a kidney-bean or a fetus. The main body extends 5'x3', elongated SW-NE with a bulbous portion on the northeast side and an indentation (weaker nebulosity) on the south side.  Overall the surface brightness is very high, though uneven, and much fainter haze and filaments flow out from the Bean in most directions.  Within the main body, the nebula is brightest in a loop on the southwest side and secondly in a section on the northeast side.


LH 10, a large cluster or OB-association (youngest in the LMC-N11 complex) with roughly two dozen resolved stars is involved with the nebula.  LH 10 includes a number of 12-13 mag stars (several of which are massive O3-type stars), many in an elongated 1' group on the southwestern side.  The brightest mag 11.7 "star" (PGMW 3070) is actually an extremely compact cluster with 18 stars resolved by the HST.  A wide pair [17" separation] of mag 11.9 and 12.9 stars (O3-type HD 268721 and O8-type PGMW 3223) is ~1.5' ENE of the main stellar group; one of these may be IC 2115. At the northeast edge of the cluster is mag 11.3 HD 268726 (blue supergiant) and 45" further east is IC 2116, a high surface brightness HII knot of ~15" diameter.  Very faint haze at the NE side of NGC 1763 bulges towards IC 2116.  The surrounding field is rich in stars between the individual objects with some locally brighter patches of nebulosity.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this emission nebula and cluster is set in fascinating field of several clusters and HII regions including NGC 1761, 1769, and 1773.  The nebula is fairly bright, large, very elongated WSW-ENE, 4'x2'.  A few stars are superimposed on the nebulosity.  The roughly oval outline is irregular and the HII region appears brighter on the WSW side near a rich group of stars at the WSW tip.  A couple of mag 11 stars are close off the NE end.  IC 2115 and IC 2116 comprise the western and eastern portion of this object.  After viewing this group of objects, the LMC which was well past the meridian disappeared behind some low clouds.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1763 = D 230 on 6 Nov 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "very faint rather elliptical nebula, about 2' diameter.  This is the preceding largest of three nebulae forming a triangle".  Dunlop made two observations and his position is ~12' south of the "Bean Nebula", but his description seems to apply.


John Herschel made 5 observations of this nebula, describing it on one sweep as "a vB, vL neb with stars (the chief of which in the anterior part of the neb taken) of a crooked rounded oblong starpe.  A fine object.  See fig. 3. Plate III."  His excellent sketch includes NGC 1760, 1761, 1763 and 1769.  Joseph Turner also sketched the complex between 17 Apr and 21 Apr 1879 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  The gaseous nature of NGC 1763 was discovered by Annie Jump Cannon on spectrum plates taken at Harvard's Arequipa station in 1897.

The cluster forms the western vertex of a triangle with NGC 1782 7.4' E and NGC 1772 9.5' SSE.  Just 2' N, I noticed a very faint and small, round cluster, ~15" diameter (verified as Shapley-Lindsay 123).  These clusters are part of LH 8, a large OB-association of stars.  Emission nebula LMC-N94A is off the west side and N94B is close south, though no nebulosity was noticed unfiltered.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1767 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and recorded as#123 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  Dreyer added the cluster to the GC Supplement as GC 5062.

Size 2'


30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): bright, large oval nebula oriented SW-NE, roughly 3'x2'.  At the center is a mag 11.5 "star" (Sk -66 41), with three mag 14-14.5 companions - the closest is 15" SE (Wo 599, an O3-class star).  A small, bright knot (~10" diameter) is embedded on the south side of the nebula, just 0.9' S of the central star.  NGC 1769 is roughly centered within the stunning NGC 1763 (Bean Nebula) complex with showpiece NGC 1763 just 6.5' NW, NGC 1761 6' WSW, NGC 1776 6' NE, NGC 1760 8' SW and NGC 1773 7' NNE.


Sk -66 41 was once thought to be one of the most single massive and luminous stars in the LMC but it was resolved into a very compact cluster with ~15 components.  The star 15" southeast (Wo 599 = O3-class) may be the ionizing source of the nebula.  The 10" knot on the south side (identified as HNT 1 in SIMBAD) has also been resolved into a compact cluster of ~70 stars mag 17 and fainter.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright HII region in a fascinating group with several clusters and nebulae.  Appears fairly large, round, 2' diameter with a single mag 11 at the center.  Situated  6' SE of the cluster/HII region NGC 1763 and a similar distance NNE of NGC 1760.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1769 = D 232 on 6 Nov 1826 and reported "a faint round nebula, about 1 1/2' in diameter."  His position is 11' SSW of the LMC nebula, but roughly matching the positional offset he made with NGC 1763.


John Herschel discovered the nebula on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded for h2716, "B, irregularly R; 2'; has a 10th mag star in centre." The next observation reads: "vB; vsmbM to a 10th mag star which is double or triple. Other clusters and nebulae in field." JH made a total of five observations of this nebula.

Size 3'x2'


25" (4/4/19 - OzSky): at 244x; very impressive, bright nebulous cluster 5' in diameter.  Unfiltered includes over two dozen stars from mag 11-14 with a few pairs.  Most of the stars are on the north and west side and include an 11th mag star (HD 268804) near the center and another mag 11 star on the west side.  The western component of a 9" pair of mag 12.6/13.2 stars on the north side is a Wolf-Rayet star Brey 10 (HD 32402).  Two very bright emission knots with a total size of 2' are on the south side; the southernmost knot is IC 2117.


The entire field displayed a very strong response to a NPB filter with the nebulosity irregular and patchy and the two main nebulous patches on south side intensely bright.  With careful viewing Brey 10 was surrounded by a very thin, dim arc (Wolf-Rayet bubble) of perhaps 150?, extending NW to SE of Brey 10 (opening to the NE) with a diameter of 1.5'. The SW edge of the arc was just north of (HD 268804.  The arc was subtle and visible only intermittently.


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC object is an interesting mix of a star cluster (OB-association LH 12) and an associated emission nebula (LMC-N91A = IC 2117), with the nebulosity mostly on the south side.  A mag 10 star is near the center, along with a number of mag 11-12 and fainter stars.  The stars are mostly on the north side of the nebulosity with several in small clumps.


S-L 105, located 13' SW of NGC 1770, was observed using a 25" on 17 Oct 2017.  It appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30" diameter.  Contains a relatively large bright core but there was no resolution.  An additional 6' SSW is N86, a verified LMC supernova remnant.  It was picked up unfiltered as a large, low surface brightness hazy region, just south of a mag 11.8 star.  A couple of 14th mag stars appear involved with the haze.  There was a weak contrast gain adding a NPB filter, with the most evident section ~1' diameter [centered 1.2' S of the mag 11.8 star] and slightly brighter on the east side.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1770 = D 169 = h2715 with his 9" reflector and described a "pretty bright pretty large nebula, of an irregular round figure, 5' diameter; a little brighter in the middle."  He made 2 observations and his position is accurate.  John Herschel attributed the discovery to Dunlop and described the object on 23 Nov 1834 as a "cluster of 6th class; pretty rich, large, irregular figure, brighter in the middle; stars of 11..18th mag; fine object."  On a second sweep he wrote "A star of 9th mag, the chief of a cluster of 6th class, 4' diameter; nebulous. The most condensed part is 1' south of the stars."

Located 6' SE of mag 8.2 HD 32363 and 4' SE of a mag 10.7 star (the two stars are nearly collinear with the major axis of the galaxy).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1771 = h2720 on 25 Dec 1837 and recorded "vF, mE, glbM, 25" long, in field with many B and 1 vB * 7' m np the neb."  His CGH position is accurate, but he made an error precessing the coordinates to 1860 for the GC, where the position is 10' too far south.  This was copied by Dreyer into the NGC.   Viewing through the 26" refractor at the Union Observatory, Robert Innes described it in 1926 as "Exactly like the last (ESO 85-14), slightly brighter; elongated 130?-310?; about 2'; stars seem to be involved."

At 264x it appeared as a fairly large, bright glow, oval 3:2 ~N-S, ~2.2'x1.5'.  Two brighter mag 12/13 stars (17" separation oriented SW-NE) are involved, slightly southwest of the geometric center.  On close inspection the northeastern component (mag 13 0-type supergiant SK -66?43) resolved into a very close double.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1781 = H III-268 on 6 Feb 1785 (sweep 367) and recorded "eF, vS, stellar, 240 verified it beyond doubt."  There was a confusion in the reference star on the sweep and Auwers' position (used by JH in the GC and Dreyer in the NGC) is 3.0 min of RA too far west.  Caroline Herschel's reduced position matches ESO 553-007 = PGC 16788.


Ormond Stone independently discovered this galaxy 100 years later on 11 Dec 1885, recording it in LM 1-146, but his rough position (nearest min of RA) was 1 min too far west.  His sketch (examined by Corwin) clearly establishes the equivalence.  Dreyer assumed it was new and it received the designation NGC 1794.  Herbert Howe, observing with the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver, was unable to find NGC 1781 on two nights, though measured NGC 1794.  He noted the similar descriptions and difference in RA, and concluded NGC 1781 = NGC 1794.  Dreyer repeats this in the IC 2 Notes.  In this case, NGC 1781 should takes historical precedence.  RNGC misidentifies MCG -03-13-071 = PGC 16748 as NGC 1781.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): viewed at 228x, this bright LMC cluster was fairly small, round, 40" diameter, strongly concentrated with a bright 15" core.  Several faint stars huddle very near or are resolved around the edges.  NGC 1782 forms the NE vertex of a triangle with two other LMC clusters - NGC 1767 7.4' W and NGC 1772 11' SSE.  Located on the east side of stellar association LH 8, which contains these clusters.

30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x and 264x; Intensely bright LMC cluster!  Very large, roundish, 2.5'-3' diameter, highly concentrationed with a large, brilliant core that gradually increases towards the center.  At 429x; very granular or mottled appearance.  A number of extremely faint stars and/or clumps of stars (too many to count) popped in and out of visibility.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): moderately bright, fairly large, round, 2.0' diameter, fairly smooth surface brightness.  Appears to be a globular cluster as it is well-detached in the field with a fairly crisply defined edge, increasing to a brighter 1' core.  NGC 1805 lies 20' ESE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1783 = h2726 on 13 Dec 1835 and recorded "pB, L, R, gbM, 2'." On a second sweep he called it "B, L, R, vgpmbM, resolvable 3'."

Size 3.5'


18" (4/6/16 - Coonabarabran, 236x): asterism of 8 stars superimposed on the LMC.  It includes two mag 11/11.7 stars at the northeast end and a roughly 9" pair of mag 12/12.5 stars at the southwest end.  BSDL 375, a very faint nebulous patch, was noticed 2' following the two stars at the northeast end of NGC 1785.  One or two mag 15 stars were resolved on the south side of the glow.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1785 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and included it as #147 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  No description was given but his position is 04 58 33 -68 51.3 (J2000).  ESO lists two possible candidates:  ESO 56-**38 at 04 58 45 -68 49.4 (2000) with comments "Chain of 5 to 10 sts; not in LMC" and S-L 150 = ESO 56-SC40 at 04 58 57 -69 13 04, which is LMC cluster.


In "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" [1964IrAJ....6..286L] Eric Lindsay states, "Not found. A few bright widely scattered stars NE but no cluster or nebula. There is a bright cluster, S/L 116, 2m W 3' N and a conspicuous one, S/L 117, 2m W and 7' S, neither in the NGC. The object is in the Nub. Cat. only classified as a nebula."  RNGC follows Lindsay and classifies this number as nonexistent.


Based on JH's position and his LMC sketch, Corwin identified NGC 1785 with asterism of about 5 stars superposed on the LMC (ESO 56-**38).  This is the first of the ESO candidates.

A mag 11-12 star is superimposed just northwest of the core!  KMHK 412 was picked up as a very faint glow 6.5' SE and just north of two mag 13 stars.  NGC 1786 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1786 = h2729 on 26 Nov 1834 and logged "vB, E, S. Stellar, like a star 9th mag blurred."  On the second of 3 sweeps it was called "vB, R, vsmbM, 30"."

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): large cloud of stars (association LH 15), 15'-20' in size, over an extensive haze of unresolved stars.  40 to 50 mag 11-13 stars were visible at 105x within the cluster.  NGC 1783 is located 15' S.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1787 = h2731 in the LMC on 25 Dec 1837.  His single observation placed this cluster at 05 00 17.3 -65 50 33 (2000) and his description "p Rich cl of S stars which fills field" appears to describe the entire 20'-25' stellar association HW 15, which includes NGC 1783 and SL 178.


The RNGC and NGC 2000.0 position 04 59.1 -65 44 (2000) from Lucke and Hodge's "A Catalogue of Stellar Associations in the Large Magellanic Cloud", AJ, 75, 171-175, corresponds with the northwest portion of the association.  The Hodge-Wright Atlas identifies NGC 1787 = S-L 178 at 05 01 44 -65 49.4, on the east side of the association, and ESO and Morel's Visual Atlas of the LMC follows this misidentification.  Shapley & Lindsay did not equate S-L 178 with NGC 1787.

05 06 53.2 -03 20 27; Ori

Size 8'x5'


18" (1/1/08): very interesting, bright reflection nebula at 175x.  Two brighter stars are involved in the brightest portion of the nebula with a mag 10 star (very unequal double) at the NW end.  An oval glow extends ~4'x2.5' to the SE and contains a bright "knot" that surrounds a mag 11.5 star on the SE side.  Two fainter stars are embedded within the glow and form a rhombus with the brighter stars at opposite ends.  The SW edge of the main body has a sharper edge (due to dust).  Surrounding this region are faint extensions that significantly increase the total size to ~8x6'.  Towards the SE, dim haze can be seen as far as a 2' pair of mag 12.5 stars.  Broad, wispy extensions appears to feather off to the NE for ~6' with additional faint haze to the south. The entire complex is bounded by several mag 8-9 stars forming a striking star field.


17.5" (2/9/02): at 144x this is a bright reflection nebula involving two mag 10 and 11.5 stars.  The nebulosity is irregularly bright in a 4'x3' region elongated NW-SE and locally very bright in a knot surrounding the mag 11.5 star near the SE end.  Enhanced by a Deep Sky filter at low power.  The brighter mag 10 star ~2' NW has a faint companion and is also encased in the glow as well as a couple of other fainter stars.  A faint extension fans out to the NE from the mag 11 star and some haze is suspected to the south, increasing the size to  ~7' and involving a few additional stars.  NGC 1788 is located within a bright trapezoid consisting of three mag 8.5-9 stars and a mag 10 star (sides of 9'-13')


17.5" (12/23/89): bright, fairly large, locally very bright surrounding a mag 12 star on the south end.  This star appears slightly nonstellar as difficult to separate from bright haze.  Extends NW to include a mag 10 star and three other faint stars are involved in the brightest portion.  Very faint nebulosity also extends to north and further east.


8" (12/6/80): moderately bright reflection nebula, large, brightest in center, two stars involved, extends to east.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1788 = H V-32 = h347 = Sw. II-30 = Sw. VII-9 on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518). His description reads, "cB, vL, milky, diffused and vanishing, very near and sf a bright star, the milkiness diffused and vanishing."  On 26 Nov 1786 (sweep 640) he recorded "vL, milky; seems to have some untied stars towards the southern part of it; some other stars are in it, but plainly unconnected. 3 or 4' dia.  vF except about the united stars."  Joihn Herschel wrote on 11 Feb 1830 (sweep 233), "A *10m with a neb south-following; pos 138 from *; the centre of the neb is like a misty *12 or 13m, or perhaps 2 or 3 st 15m; a small * to the south of neb makes an isosceles triangle.  Place that of the *10m."  This reflection nebula was observed 21 times at Birr Castle beginning in 1849 (the 1880 publication lists 10 of these).


Lewis Swift found this reflection nebula on 24 Nov 1884 and apparently felt that nebulosity surrounding the 10th mag star on the west side was distinct from Herschel's nebulosity, reporting it as a "nova" in his 2nd discovery list (#30) and his 7th list (#9).

A small group of stars is detached off the NW side, including a mag 10 star and an easy 14" pair.  At the east end is a small clump of 4 stars (one very faint) just following mag 9.3 HD 33247, the brightest member.  There are no rich regions and the group does not appear to be a cluster visually.  Classified as nonexistent in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1790 = h346 on 16 Feb 1831 (sweep 327) and described "A group of 8 or 9 stars 10m, nearly in parallelogram.  A pretty object."  His position corresponds with mag 9 SAO 25060 at 05 11 13.3 +52 03 54 (2000).   This appears to be an asterism on the DSS and RNGC classifies it as nonexistent.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1792 = D 531 = h2730 on 4 Oct 1826 and described "a long or rather elliptical nebula, about 2' long and 50" broad, a little brighter in the middle, and well defined. There is a group of small stars on the north side."  JH lists 3 observations in the Cape Catalogue: on his first sweep on 24 Dec 1835 he logged "vB, vL, vmE, gbM, 4' long. Taken as Dunlop 531 but too late for transit, the observation having been missed by relying on Mr Dunlop's place."  Then 2 nights later he revisited this galaxy and noted  "vB, vL, mE, glbM, 5' long, 2' broad, pos 314?, stars seen in it. Visible with moonlight and lamp illumination".  Finally on a third sweep he noted "B, vL, mE, regular elliptic; resolved. I see several small stars in it."

The low power Milky Way field is rich in bright and faint stars with glowing regions of unresolved stars.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC and not plotted on the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 1798 in Nov 1885 with the 6-inch Cooke Refractor at Vanderbilt University.

18" (11/18/06): at 115x this Milky Way field appears as a bright, large, scattered group including a couple of dozen mag 10-11 stars.  Most distinctive is a fairly rich 5' string of mag 10 to 13 stars oriented N-S.  The rest of the group is scattered and extends east and southeast ~10' in size.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1802 = H VIII-41 on 7 Dec 1785 (sweep 485) and recorded "a coarse cluster of star or projecting point of the milky way."  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, adds "many st, v sc, no distinct cl."  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent but WEBDA has a listing for NGC 1802.

14" (4/7/16 - Coonabarabran, 178x): moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE, 30"x24", fairly high surface brightness.  NGC 1803 is situated 4.7' ENE of mag 5.0 Eta-2 Pictoris and the bright glare of the star hampered the observation.


Forms a close pair with ESO 203-019 2.2' SE.  The companion appeared as a slightly soft mag 13 "star", as only the nucleus of the galaxy was seen.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1803 = h2737 on 28 Dec 1834 and described "F, S, R, vglbM; query whether a star 11..12th mag near it S.f. be not also nebulous."  Herschel's object south-following is likely ESO 203-019, located 2.2' southeast, which did not receive a NGC designation (Steinicke concurs).

Tightly packed into a very high surface brightness glow. S-L 180 lies 4' NE and appeared as a fairly faint, moderately large, round, 0.5' diameter, soft glow with no resolution.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1804 = h2742 on 3 Nov 1834 and described "F (?), R, bM (Thick haze in sky)".  On a second sweep his description reads "F, S, R, 30".  Shapley and Lindsay (1963) give a diameter of 25'' and remark "few stars, partly condensed."

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): very bright, fairly small, brilliant core, 30" diameter.  A mag 13 star is situated just off the NW side, 25" from center.  The core is oddly displaced off-center in the direction of this star.  A few faint stars are resolved in the halo and a mag 13.5 star is at the south edge.  NGC 1783 lies 20' WNW and NGC 1822 is 18' ESE (all three collinear).


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): moderately bright, small, 25" diameter, sharply concentrated with a quasi-stellar bright nucleus.  A mag 13 star is at the NW edge (24" from center).  This is a well-studied young (40 million years old) LMC star cluster.  Located 20' ESE of NGC 1783.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1805 = D 233 = h2741 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a small round well-defined nebula, 10" or 12" diameter".  His position is 6' SSW of the cluster.


JH made 5 observations, the first on 2 Nov 1834 in which he recorded "a vS compact cluster of stars 11th mag with (?) nebulosity, 20"."  On later sweeps he wrote "B, S, R, sbM, 25", has two stars very near, one N.p. one S.f." and "vB, vS, vsvmbM, a condensed knot of stars, two of which (one on either side) are exterior."

18" (1/26/09): this asterism contains a very faint galaxy, CGCG 469-003, located just following a 26" pair of mag 11.5/12 stars just south of center.  The galaxy appeared very faint and small, round, 15" diameter, low surface brightness.


17.5" (2/1/92): bright, moderately large, striking group of 30 stars mag 9-14 in 12' including 10 stars mag 11 or brighter.  Five bright stars are in a 11' string oriented N-S.  The central star in this string is a pleasing, close double star h3268; consisting of mag 9.5/10.5 stars at 10" separation.  This double is collinear with two mag 11 stars 1.3' E and 2.9' E oriented perpendicular to the string.  Several other members trail to SW forming a cross asterism.


8": ~25 stars in cluster including 10-12 brighter stars, several almost collinear.  A double star mag 10/11 at 10" separation is near the center.  Forms a pair of open clusters with NGC 1817 25' NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1807 = h348 on 25 Jan 1832 (sweep 395) and logged, "a cluster of 10 or 12 large and a good many small stars.  The place that of a double star."  It is perhaps an outlier of VII.4 (NGC 1817)."  His position is accurate.


A 2004 study ("uvby-H-beta CCD photometry of NGC 1817 and NGC 1807") concludes NGC 1807 is not a distinct cluster. Only NGC 1817, a very extended open cluster, covers the area.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this 105x this striking starburst galaxy appeared bright, large, very elongated 4:1 NW-SE, 5'x1.3'.  The glow is sharply concentrated with a well-defined 20" core that brightens to a stellar nucleus.  There appears to be an irregular extension at the northwest end that brightens and is offset to the major axis [on photos this corresponds with the start of a spiral arm that is attached at the north edge of the NW end of the galaxy].  At 166x, the halo is irregular and mottled.  Brightest in a group (LGG 127) along with NGC 1792 40' SW and the galaxies may have experienced a tidal interaction in the past.


17.5" (1/31/87): bright, fairly large, small elongated core, long thin arms 4:1 NW-SE.  A mag 14 star is off the NW end.  This is a very pleasing galaxy.


8" (1/1/84): fairly bright, elongated NW-SE, moderately large, bright core.  Similar in size to NGC 1792 but slightly fainter.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1808 = D 549 = h2740 on 10 May 1826 and described "a faint nebula, about 2.5' long, and fully 1' broad, extended S.p. and N.f.; a very minute star near each extremity, not involved."  He observed it on 2 occasions and his position was ~7' too far east. D 532 is probably a duplicate observation, but the position was off by 42' ESE.


John Herschel made two observations from the Cape.  On 24 Dec 1835 he logged "B, L, lE, first gradually then psmbM.  Transit missed, PD very rough"  Two nights later he reobserved it and noted "B, E, 3' long, 1.5' broad; in a field strongly illuminated by the moon in her first quarter."


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 1808 with a very bright, elongated core on 19 Dec. 1876 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 26). See www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_26.php)

At 128x it appeared as a large, very faint, low surface brightness glow with very weak if any concentration and no visible core or nucleus.  With careful viewing the galaxy is elongated 5:2 or 3:1 NW-SE, perhaps 1.6'x0.6'.  Located 5' SE of mag 8 HD 33031.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1809 = h2747 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded (one one sweep only) "pF, S, R, gbM, 40", the second of two in field [with NGC 1801 = h2739]."  His position is 4' south of ESO 056-048 = PGC 16599, a pretty low surface brightness galaxy that was not found by Robert Innes in 1926 at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg with the 26.5-inch refractor!


Eric Lindsay, in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" [1964IrAJ....6..286L], commented "At the same RA but 4' N an object which may be a galaxy, 210'' x 50''.  In "Exploring the Southern Sky" (1987), the authors (Laustsen, Madsen and West) noted "It has been known for more than a century, and for a long time was believed to belong to the LMC.  However, less than a decade ago, it became possible to measure the radial velocity...Somewhat unexpectedly, the velocity was found to be 1000 km/s, or several times larger than the velocities of stars and other LMC nebulae..."

Located 2.6' ESE of mag 10.3 HD 268879.  A mag 12.5 star lies 45" N.  Forms a pair with brighter NGC 1818 6' SE.  S-L 205 lies 8.4' ENE.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1810 = D 235 = h2746 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a small round pretty well defined nebula."  He made a single observation and his position is 11' south-southeast of the cluster.  It's also possible that this observation refers to brighter NGC 1818 -- along with D 234 and D236, though the latter two are placed south of D 235, agreeing with orientation of NGC 1810 and 1818.


JH made a total of 5 observations beginning on 6 Nov 1834.  In order of his observations, he logged "eF, S, R, 15", precedes a globular cluster.", "vF, R, lbM, 40 arcsec", "F, S, R", "pF, R, lbM, 25 arcsec" and "Nebula; no description but that it has a globular cluster following it."  The cluster he refers to is NGC 1818 and Herschel attributed Dunlop's 235 with the discovery.

The nebulosity had a fair response using the NPB filter with a brighter piece on the northeast side and a 2' irregular shape.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1834 = h2764 on 11 Nov 1836 and recorded (single sweep) "B, vvS, lE, uniform in light, 10" across."  His position is 30" S of this compact cluster.  The NGC description added the query "Planetary?"  On the DSS, this object appears to be an extremely compact cluster, though perhaps a brighter star is superimposed.


Eric Lindsay, in the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud", comments "A fairly bright star blended with two faint ones. Questioned as a planetary nebula in the NGC. Prism plates show a fairly strong continuum only, and it is probably an early-type star."  RNGC follows Lindsay and misidentifies NGC 1834 as a triple star. Hodge and Wright note that it "may only be a bright star in a rich field".  The ESO records it as a globular cluster (ESO 056-SC060) but gives no other details.  NGC 2000.0 misidentifies this object as an asterism.

At 228x, this LMC globular cluster appears bright, moderately large, round, 1.5' diameter, strongly concentrated with a small bright core.  This object has a very symmetrical appearance with a high surface brightness like a compact globular cluster.  NGC 1834 lies 12' N.


NGC 1835 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.  It has the highest known number (84) of RR Lyr variables in the LMC and is the brightest and most elliptical of the classic globulars.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1835 = D 116 = h2763 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a small round pretty well-defined nebula, bright at the centre." The description fits this globular, though his position is nearly 15' SSE of center (fairly typical error).  John Herschel independently discovered the cluster in December 1834 and recorded "vB, S, R, pmbM; 40"; the last of three [with NGC 1828 and 1830]."  His position is accurate.  The cluster is missing from the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas although it includes nearby NGC 1828 and 1830.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): bright LMC cluster, relatively large, high surface brightness, very elongated NW-SE, 1.2'x0.4'.  The dominant portion of the cluster is on the NW end and appears bright, roundish, 25"-30" diameter with a few stars resolved just outside the glow. A 14th magnitude star is off the SE side and connects to a small  knot (BRHT 4b) containing a very tight string of 15th magnitude stars.  Forms a striking pair with NGC 1839 2.5' E.  HS 109 is 5.4' S and several other small clusters are in the field.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1836 = h2766 on 23 Nov 1834 (along with NGC 1839 = h2768), though no description or position was given.  On his second sweep (30 Dec 1836) he noted "the first nucleus of a clustering group of mixed stars and nebulosity."  His position is accurate.

25" (10/10/15 - OzSky): at 318x; this cluster is primarily a very elongated N-S string of stars with some unresolved haze. There was no filter response.  A few brighter mag 12.5-13 stars are involved with a total of a dozen in the 1.2' string.  NGC 1837 forms a 3' pair with NGC 1833 to the west-southwest.  A star cloud extends to the north with several mag 12 stars, along with many faint stars in the wider field.  This magnificent association (LH 26) is rich in bright and faint stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1837 = h2769 on 3 Nov 1834.  He observed this cluster on two sweeps and recorded it as "The last of three clustering groups (hazy)" and "the most condensed part of a large rich cluster of scattered stars which more than fills field."  Archinal notes that brightest star is at 05 04 56.8 -70 42 57, close to Herschel's second position.  It is not clear what other two objects he was referring to in the first sweep as only NGC 1833 is in the same field, though the star cloud (stellar association LH 24) containing these clusters extends to the northeast.

30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): excellent scattered cluster/association in the LMC.  Includes many brighter mag 11.5-13 stars along with dozens of fainter stars.  Perhaps 75 stars down to mag 15 are resolved in a 7' region.  Located just east of mag 8.2 HD 33617 with mag 10.2 HD 269035 at the southeast edge.


There are three Shapley-Lindsay clusters (not specifically mentioned by Herschel) at the edges. S-L 225, at the southwest edge, appeared  fairly bright, round, 50" diameter.  Several mag 14-16 stars are resolved, particularly along the north side.  Located 2' SSE of mag 8.2 HD 33617.  A mag 11.7 star is 1.3' WSW.  S-L 230, at the northern edge, appeared very bright, fairly small LMC cluster, 30"x20" ~N-S, clumpy.  At 394x, a brighter star is resolved along with a few very faint stars and a quasi-stellar knot.  It was too densely packed for additional resolution.  Just 1' SW of S-L 230 is S-L 229, a pretty faint small glow, ~20" diameter, with no resolution.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1838 = h2767 on 30 Dec 1836 and logged as "a star 7 mag, the chief of a large very loose clustering mass."  The star was earlier listed in the Brisbane Catalogue of Stars (published in 1835) as B895, and JH references the Brisbane number in the Cape Catalogue.


Shapley-Lindsay, ESO and the Hodge-Wright Atlas identity the small knot S-L 225 as NGC 1838.  Jenni Kay states that Herschel's description clearly refers to the larger star group, which contains a few small, faint open clusters within it, including S-L 225 and S-L 230.  The large, loose grouping including a mag 8 star is roughly 10' in diameter, compared to S-L 225, which is just 35".  Harold Corwin notes that S-L 225 may be outside of JH's intended object.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very bright cluster forming a striking pair with NGC 1836 just 2.5' W.  At 200x appears as a very high surface brightness irregular glo, ~30" diameter, mottled but not resolved.  A group of six mag 13-14 stars is off the west side in two short N-S strings.  Several fainter clusters are in the field including HS 117 5' SSE, HS 109 6' SSW and S-L 234 6' SE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1839 = h2768 (along with NGC 1836 = h2766) on 23 Nov 1834 and described as "pB, irregular figure; the following of 2 [with NGC 1836] in field together." On a second sweep he called it "the second nucleus of a binuclear clustering group of mixed nebula and stars."


Herschel questioned, though, whether this object was Dunlop 170, which was described as "a pretty large faint nebula, irregular figure."  Dunlop's RA is 1.7 tmin too large and I would assume if NGC 1839 was picked up then so would NGC 1836, just 2.5' W.

More likely, though, NGC 1840 is a duplite of NGC 1833.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1840 = h2771 on 3 Nov 1834 and described "F, R, bM, resolvable.  Hardly visible through a thick haze.  The observations makes the RA 6m 13.5s, but this is impossible from the context [of the sweep].  It *may* be 8m."  In the Cape observations, Herschel gives a position of 5h 7m 13.5s (1830), which is ~3' too far west, and that position is also used in the GC.  In any case, the only nearby object is an asterism of 4 stars.


Eric Lindsay, in  the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud", comments "There is some confusion about the RA. Dreyer chose the position 5h 6m 13.5' (1830) instead of 5h 7m 13.5s adopted by Herschel. There is nothing at either position. The object was hardly visible though a thick haze, the observation made the RA 6m which was considered impossible and may even by 8m. At the latter is the small cluster S/L 235."


In August 2016 Harold Corwin went over the sweep carefully and concluded "Checking this arc, we find two candidate objects:  NGC 1833 and SL 249 (at

05 07 35, -70 44.9).  The NGC object (= h 2765) is the larger and brighter of the two, and its position is off JH's by even digits:  1 minute of time, and 1 degree of declination.  This makes it likely to also be NGC 1840."

NGC 1841 resides in the halo and is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.  It is also the southernmost globular in the sky.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1841 = h2788 on 19 Jan 1836 and described "pF, L, irregularly round, vgbM, resolvable, 3' diameter. (RA open to much error for want of zero stars to be depended on)."  Although his RA is off by 1 tmin, his position still matches the globular very well at this declination.


Shapley and Paraskevopoulos announced it was a new globular cluster, possibly extragalactic (credited to Mrs. Seyfert, based on a long-exposure plate).

in "Southern Clusters and Galaxies" (Harvard Obs. Bull., No.914, 6).  The listed V magnitude of 14.1 is almost certainly too faint.

25" (10/10/15 - OzSky): at 318x; very large star cloud/association (LH 26) completely filling the 19' field.  At the northeast end is the small open cluster S-L 232, which is often taken as NGC 1845.  It appeared as a moderately bright, nebulous patch, roundish, 30" diameter, unresolved.  A mag 11.2 star is 0.9' SW.  The star cloud generally trends northeast to southwest (from S-L 232), stretching ~20'x10', and includes the open cluster NGC 1833 and 1837 at the southwest end. The cloud includes a stunning mix of bright (a few mag 9.5 stars are Milky Way stars), numerous mag 12-13 stars and faint stars over the glowing LMC background haze of myriad unresolved stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1845 = h2770 on 24 Nov 1834 and simply noted the position was "the general middle of the same cluster [field containing NGC 1837 = h2769]."  On a second sweep he gave the more detailed description, "a star 9m the second in magnitude and near the centre of clustering groups which run together and form a cluster which fills the whole field. vl comp M; st 11...16m."  His two positions refer to different objects: probably the small cluster S-L 232 to the northeast of HD 269070 and the much larger star cloud itself (LH 26 association).  Uranometria 2000 misclassifies this object as a bright nebula.  The Hodge-Wright LMC Atlas identifies S-L 232 as NGC 1845.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1846 = h2774 on 2 Nov 1834 and logged "B; L; R; gbM; 3'."  He recorded this cluster on 4 different sweeps and his position is accurate.  James Dunlop possibly discovered the cluster earlier (D 209) on 6 Nov 1826 and described a "very faint round nebula, 45" diameter, preceding a bright star in the same parallel."  He made a single observation and his position is 9' SW of center, certainly within the range of Dunlop's usual measurements.

Joseph Turner described and sketched NGC 1847 on 18 Dec 1875 with the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 27): "It has a mottled appearance, the bright parts being very bright, as if consisting of very small stars. Sometimes these bright parts sparkle, but I cannot make out any distinct stars, although I feel convinced that these exist. The small star immediately south of nebula and close to it is involved in very faint nebula. H.'s drawing of this object is very unlike its present appearance. He describes it as having a double star in centre and his drawing also shows it so. The nebula presents altogether a more mottled appearance than indicated by H.'s sketch, and the two brighter parts might easily, upon an unfavourable night, be mistaken for the double star with H. shows in his drawing; I can however make nothing more of it than already stated. Night exquisite"


On 19th November 1884, Barachi noted using the GMT: "Pretty large, elongated, bright patches within it, not stars. Sparkling looks as if resolvable, but not so. Agrees exactly with Turner's drawing. Position of neighbouring stars agrees exactly with T. Nebula is most likely unchanged. H. puts a double star in it. This double star is perhaps represented now by the bright patches. It may be that H.'s stars have changed into diffused patches." Both T. and B. consider the lithograph as fairly representing the object."

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 350x in the 24" I was stunned by the view of this huge, extremely bright, blue globular cluster!  The outer halo, which extends 5' in diameter, was resolved into dozens of faint stars arranged in irregular star chains that appear to stream out of the core.  A single brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on the west side [30" W of center is the core of companion cluster NGC 1850A].  The center is highly concentrated with an extremely bright 1' core that appears elongated, irregular and clumpy with a curved outline.  A small, 20" diffuse glow is embedded at the north edge of the halo (open cluster S-L 260).


NGC 1850 resides in a glorious LMC region that is packed with an unbelievable number of clusters and HII regions including NGC 1854 6' SE and NGC 1858, a huge cluster and nebulosity, ~10' SE.  A faint loop of nebulosity (LMC-N103A) is involved with the cluster, extending ~N-S on the east end, but I didn't try a filter to see if it was visible.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): After the Tarantula region (30 Doradus complex), NGC 1850 is the brightest star cluster in the LMC and at an estimated age of only 40-50 million years, this rich, globular-like cluster has no counterpart in the Milky Way!  At 128x, the cluster appeared very bright (9th magnitude), large, round, ~3.5' diameter, well concentrated with an intensely bright 1' core.  A brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on the western side of the halo. Several very faint stars are resolved in the very lively halo.


NGC 1850 lies in a very impressive region of the LMC (near the outskirts of the central bar) with 13 additional NGC clusters/nebulosity within 30' including NGC 1854 7' SE, NGC 1858 10' SE, NGC 1856 22' SSE and several others including NGC 1836, 1839, 1847, 1860, 1863, 1865.  Unfortunately dawn was starting to break so I only was able to view the first group of objects mentioned above and I need to return to this field!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1850 = D 172 = h2780 on 3 Aug 1826 and described a "pretty bright round nebula, 40" diameter.  This is the preceding and brightest of three nebulae in a line."  His position was 10' too far east but correct in declination.  The other two "nebulae" are NGC 1855 and 1858.  D 170 may be a duplicate observation ("a pretty large faint nebula, irregular figure.")


John Herschel observed this cluster on 6 sweeps beginning on 2 Nov 1834 when he logged "pretty bright, small, round, a cluster of stars 12th mag; diam 1'." The 2nd sweep was recorded as "globular, very bright, very much compressed, 3' diameter." On the third sweep he noted "globular, a fine large clusgter st = 13m, mbM."  Herschel gave possible synonyms with D 172 as well as D 170.

18" (1/17/09): at 275x this very bright globular spanned ~6' and contained a blazing 1.5' core.  Nearly two dozen stars were resolved including a distinctive SSW-NNE string that runs past the west side of the core.  The observation was hampered by the low elevation of this globular from northern California (~10? elevation).


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 200x, this compact globular was very bright, strongly concentrated with an intense 1.5' core and a 4-5' fainter halo.  The core was very lively and there were ~30 stars resolved [brightest cluster members are mag 13.2], mostly in the loose halo. A neat loop of stars emerges from the core and runs NNE-SSW along the west edge of the core.


17.5" (1/31/87): small bright core, large very mottled halo.  About 20 stars are resolved, mostly west of the core.

8" (10/13/81): small, very small bright core, faint halo.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1851 = D 508 = h2777 on 10 May 1826 with his 9-inch speculum f/12 reflector at Parramatta, New South Wales. His decription reads "exceedingly bright, round, well-defined nebula, about 1.5' diameter, exceedingly condensed, almost to the very margin.  This is the brightest small nebula that I have seen. I tried several magnifying powers on this beautiful globe; a considerable portion round the margin is resolvable, but the compression to the centre is so great that I cannot reasonably expect to separate the stars. I compared this with the 68 Conn. des Tems, and this nebula greatly exceeds the 68 in condensation and brightness." Dunlop observed it 5 times.


John Herschel recorded it on 23 Oct 1835 as a "superb globular cluster; all resolved into stars of 14th mag.; very suddenly much brighter in the middle to a blaze or nucleus of light; diam. in RA = 15 seconds of time. Difference of left and right eyes in resolving this cluster very remarkable. Returning from the left to the right eye, the object (in comparison) appears as if glazed over with a kind of dull film." On a later sweep he wrote, "very bright; round; very suddenly very much brighter in the middle; 3'; all clearly resolved into stars from 14 to 16 mag except at the centre, where they are massed together into a blaze of light." His final observation reads "Superb globular cluster, very bright; round; first very gradually then suddenly very much brighter in the middle; 4'; resolved, the stars barely visible in strong twilight."

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I revisited this remarkable field after viewing NGC 1850 (located 6' NW) the previous night.  At 200x this cluster appeared very bright, large, round, with a brilliant core.  At 350x, it was resolved into numerous faint stars around the edges of the intense core.  Up to a couple of dozen very faint stars popped in and out of visibility. The core is noticeably elongated N-S and is surrounded by a large, much fainter halo.  There is a small clump of stars at the NW edge.  NGC 1858, a large star cluster and nebulosity, lies 4' SE.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, fairly small, oval 4:3 NW-SE, 0.8'x0.6', moderate concentration. There is a small knot attached to the north edge.  Located 6' SE of NGC 1850 with NGC 1858 4.5' further SE in a region of the LMC packed with clusters.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1854 = D 119 on 2 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector and noted a "small round pretty well-defined nebula".  His position is 12' ESE of NGC 1854 (bright core of NGC 1855) and nearby NGC 1858 = D 120 has a similar offset.  It is also possible that D 119 refers to NGC 1858, as Dunlop's position is directly east of NGC 1858 by 8'.


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 1854 = h2782 on 23 Nov 1834 (Dunlop is not referenced) and logged "a cluster nebula, S, R, pB, 40"."  On a 2nd sweep he noted "globular, B, S, R, 25", resolvable."  On the 3rd sweep logged as "B, S, R, 35"." The 4th observation reads "B, E, gbM, 2' resolvable. The second of three objects." His final observations reads: "F, R, gbM, 40"."  Except for the 4th observation, these refer to the core of the cluster (NGC 1855).  His observation for NGC 1855 = h2783 reads "a vB, L, round cluster of stars 12m, 5' diameter [this obs must refer to the general cluster in which the former (NGC 1854) is situated as a nebulous-looking knot - a combination of the most ordinary occurence in the Nubecula Major, though very rare in other parts of the heavens."


NGC 1854 and 1855 are equated in S-L (1963) and ESO as well as online sources such as SIMBAD.  Brent Archinal has separate listings for NGC 1854 ("central portion") and NGC 1855 in his book "Star Clusters".

He has 5 observations of h2782 (the central core of the cluster), but only this single observation noting a much larger field.  Most sources, such as ESO and SIMBAD, simply equate the two numbers or refer to the cluster as NGC 1855, though Brent Archinal has separate listings for both objects in his book "Star Clusters".

His position is 6' ENE of NGC 1856 and the position of the nearby star clinches the identification.  JH missed the possible earlier observation by Dunlop and independently swept up the cluster on 3 Nov 1834, logging it as "B, R, gbM, 12 seconds diameter in RA in time. Has a bright star to south."  On a second sweep he noted "B, pL, R, gbM, 1.5'."  Robert Innes, observing with the 26.5-inch Union Observatory refractor in 1926, described a "cluster, 90" diameter, bM, stars 14th mag and fainter."

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 1858 would be a fascinating nebula and cluster (association LH 31) even if it was isolated, but it's more striking situated at the southeast end of a wonderful chain with the bright cluster NGC 1854 and NGC 1850, one of the top showpieces in the LMC.  At 346x about two dozen stars were superimposed over an elongated glow and many other stars were just outside the glow.  At 200x with a UHC filter, the associated emission nebula (LMC-N105) was very bright overall with a very high surface brightness patch (N105A = HD 269111), roughly 30" in size, at the north end.   This patch contains the mag 13.9 Wolf-Rayet star Brey 16a = HD 269113.  The nebula is brightest along the west and east border and weaker in the center.  The elongation is towards a mag 12 star on the south side (Blue supergiant HD 269116).  HD 34169, a mag 13.7 star off the west side, is a rare eclipsing binary, consisting of a Wolf-Rayet WN4 star (Brey 16) and an O5-class blue supergiant.  The nebulosity forms part of a Superbubble. NGC 1854 lies 4.5' NW.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): third of three bright objects in a NW to SE string with NGC 1850 and NGC 1854/55.  This is a large and very unusual cluster with nebulosity.  There is a bright knot attached near the NW edge, ~15"-20" in diameter.  This knot responds very well to a UHC filter at 76x (27 Panoptic).  An obvious elongated patch of nebulous haze curves to the SE with several mag 13 stars involved with the glow and extended N-S.  Overall, the size of the cluster/nebulosity extends to 3.5'x2'.  Located 4.5' SE of NGC 1854.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1858 = D 120 on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "small round nebula, about 30" diameter."  His position is 14' ESE of this cluster/nebula (association?).


John Herschel missed the earlier observation by Dunlop (not referenced in the CGH catalogue) due to the poor position and independently discovered NGC 1858 = h2784 on 2 Nov 1834, noting "A bright cl of irregular figure."  Herschel observed the cluster on no less than 7 sweeps.  The next observation was recorded as "a large, irregularly elongated cluster and nebula. Has two bright nebulae N.p." On a third occasion he noted it as "bright, large, irregular figure; binuclear; 3' long, 2' broad. The S.f. of 3."  His final observation was recorded as "Two oval nebulae joining." He notes: "This object, by diagrams, made in several of the observations, appears to consist of a resolvable and irresolvable portion, the general form being that of a somewhat crooked oblong extended from N.p. to S.f. at an angle of 60 or 70 degrees with the parallel, the northern end being nebulous, the southern starry. This anomolous form and constitution will serve to explain the apparent disagreement of these descriptions and places."

John Herschel discovered NGC 1865 = h2794 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "vF, pL, R, vglbM, 45"." His position (measured on 3 sweeps) is accurate.  James Dunlop possibly discovered this cluster earlier in 1826 and described for D 173, "a small faint nebula, 12" diameter."  He made a single observation and his position is 6.4' NE of the cluster.  Herschel noted the possible equivalence with D 173.

30" (11/6/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): beautiful, highly resolved "blue globular" in the LMC.  Appeared very bright, very large, with an intense 1' core surrounded by a 5' halo containing a few dozen very faint stars.  The core itself was partially resolved into a number of densely packed stars over bright, mottled haze.  NGC 1859 lies 18' NW.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 166x, this LMC globular appeared moderately bright and fairly large large, round, 2.5' diameter.  The appearance was symmetrical with a faint 2.5' halo increasing to a 1' bright core which was concentrated to the center.  There was no obvious resolution although the surface was grainy or mottled.  Forms an equilateral triangle with a mag 11-12 star 3' WNW and a mag 12-13 star 3' NNW.  This is a young populous "blue globular" with an age of roughly 100 million years.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1866 = D 247 = D 248 on 3 Aug 1826 and described (for D 247) "a pretty bright round nebula, 40" diameter."  His position for this entry (1 observation) is 10' too far NW.  Dunlop described D 248 as "a pretty bright round well-defined nebula, about 30" diameter, gradually brighter to the centre."  He claims 3 observations for this object and the published position is 9' too far east.  Since both descriptions are quite similar and this is the only bright object in the vicinity, it's reasonable to assume D 247 = D 248 = NGC 1866.  John Herschel described NGC 1866 = h2793) as "vB; L; R; vgmbM; 2'; resolvable." and listed both Dunlop entries as possible equivalences.   In 1926, Robert Innes described the cluster as "fine cluster of stars, very dense, with outliers, 2' diam, a miniature of Omega Centauri, 8th mag." (26-inch refractor, Union Observatory).

05 13 52.7 -67 22 41; Dor

V = 10.5;  Size 14'


30" (10/12/15 - OzSky): S-L 326 (middle of three clusters within a large star cloud) consists of a mag 11.5 star, along with 5 other fairly bright stars and a number of faint stars (12-15 total resolved).  The cluster is encased in an irregular HII glow with a brighter patch (LMC-N30A) to the southeast of the mag 11.5 star.  The glow is moderately enhanced with the NPB filter, which reveals nebulosity extending off the cluster to the west.  HD 34632 = Brey 17, is a mag 13.1 Wolf-Rayet star (binary) is on the west side of the cluster.


NGC 1873 lies 3' N and NGC 1871 is 4.5' S.  All three clusters appear as local enhancements anchored by bright stars and lie within a striking star cloud (large association of blue supergiants including LH 32/34/36/37/38).  A rich background glow of unresolved stars extends west and north.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): fairly faint, hazy glow (= S-L 326) around a mag 10.5 star (HD 269183) with a couple of mag 12 stars close west.  NGC 1873 lies 2.7' N with 1871 4.4' S.  Located 11.5' S of mag 4.9 Theta Doradus.  Shapley used NGC 1869 as the center of "Constellation" IV, a 33'x33' association of blue supergiants.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1869 = h2798 on 30 Jan 1835 and described (sweep 658) a "cluster of 7th class; a fine L cluster of scattered stars which fills field.  The point taken is the middle of 3 groups [including NGC 1871 and 1873] in the most condensed part."  On a second sweep (2 Jan 1837) he noted "The first of a series of clusters which extends northwards as far as B 922 [Theta Doradus]."  NGC 2000, ESO and Morel's Visual Atlas of the LMC all identify NGC 1869 with S-L 326, a small cluster flanked by NGC 1871 to the south and NGC 1873 to the north of JH's position.  This is the object described by JH on his second sweep.  But Jenni Kay notes that "I am confident the small cluster centrally positioned between NGC 1871 and NGC 1873, being 2.5' in size is not JH's cluster.  The whole star group is attractive enough to warrant it's own designation. ...the small OC was used to measure a position only for the whole group which is the true NGC 1869 JH cluster."  Based on his two sweeps, NGC 1869 refers BOTH to the small cluster and to the star cloud (Lucke-Hodge associations 36/37/38 as well as 34/32).


Wolfgang Steinicke, as well as John Herschel, attributes James Dunlop with the discovery of NGC 1869 on 24 Sep 1826 as his position for D 210 is just 3.4' ESE of S-L 326 in the center of the association (the "point taken" by JH).  Dunlop's description reads "a small round nebula, rather faint.  This is the preceding in a line of nebulae and small stars, with a star of the 7th magnitude at the north extremity."  Although Dunlop gives a sketch, I couldn't match it up with the DSS to tell what object he was sketching.  Another reasonable guess is that D 210 applies to NGC 1871, which is the "southern" cluster in a line of nebulae extending north to Theta Doradus.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this cluster appeared very bright, small, round, at most 30" in diameter.  The cluster was very grainy and lively at 350x and a few extremely faint stars occasionally popped into view.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1870 = D 123 = h2799 on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta and described "a faint ill-defined nebula, 2' diameter."  His position, from a single observation, is 9.5' ESE of the cluster.  JH independently discovered the cluster on 30 Jan 1835 and logged "B; S; R; glbM; 25."

A very small nonstellar knot is near the center; a mag 11.8 blue supergiant (HD 34664) is just 25" N and a mag 11.4 star (HDE 269195) is at the E end.  Nebulosity encases the stars and is moderately enhanced with an NPB filter.  Located at the southeast end of a 15' star cloud (includes LH 32/34/36/37/38) with NGC 1869 = S-L 326 4.6' N and NGC 1873 7' N.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, this is a small group of stars in the LMC, 4 stars are resolved in nebulosity.  NGC 1873 lies 7' N and NGC 1864 is 12' SW.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1871 = D 210 on 24 Sep 1826 and recorded "a small round nebula, rather faint.  This is the preceding in a line of nebulae and small stars, with a star of the 7th magnitude at the north extremity".  Although NGC 1871 is not "preceding in a line", it is the furthest south in a line and his position is just 5' NE of this cluster.


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 1871 = h2800 on 2 Nov 1834 and described "a poor cluster; the southern of three (with NGC 1869 and 1873) of four."  On a subsequent sweep he logged "the second of a series of clusters which extend northwards as far as B 922."  His mean position from two sweeps is accurate.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright globular was the first LMC object I observed in the 24" and the view and surrounding field was very striking.  At 200x, the cluster appeared very bright, fairly large, round, 1.25' diameter, with a very bright core and a mottled halo.  A couple of mag 14-14.5 stars are near the edge of the halo.


Just to the east is a fairly rich scattering of stars including a 6' N-S curving chain that includes several mag 11-12 stars with a nice mag 12 pair at the north end (NGC 1881).  The southern end of the chain is near an impressive complex (stellar association LH 35) containing five HII regions (NGC 1874, 1876, 1877 and 1880) which are located ~4' S and 5' SSE of NGC 1872.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1872 = h2802 = D 121 on 24 Sep 1826 and recorded "a small round nebula." (single observation).  This would require he made a 15' error in declination too far south, a typical error.  See NGC 1876.


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 1872 = h2802 on 3 Nov 1834 and reported "B, R, gbM; the preceding nebula." The next observation was recorded as "pB, S, R, insulated in the recess of an arc-formed nebulous cluster (See plate III fig 6 for this and several following objects)."

John Herschel discovered NGC 1884 = h2812 on 3 Jan 1837 and noted,"eF, 2' diameter."  There is nothing obvious on the DSS at his position (29 tsec east and 2' south of NGC 1882).  Eric Lindsay reports "not found" in his 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud".  ESO equates NGC 1884 with NGC 1882.  Since NGC 1882 and 1884 were recorded on the same sweep, this seems unlikely.  If JH made a 10' error in dec, then NGC 1884 could be a duplicate of NGC 1887 instead, though his size estimate would be significantly too large.  Finally, Harold Corwin notes this number may refer to 3 stars close to JH's position.

48" (10/29/16): at 488x; bright, striking edge-on 7:1 SW-NE, at least 2.0'x0.3', contains a brighter bulging core.  This large, thin edge-on is nearly bisected by a thin, pretty subtle dust lane slightly north of the central axis.  The portion of the core south of the lane was slightly larger and more prominent with a smaller section of the core north of the lane.  A mag 10.0 star (HD 35127) is 2.7' SW, nearly collinear with the major axis.  In additional a mag 9.3 star is 3.6' SSW (HD 35157) and a mag 10 star (HD 35105) is 6' WNW.  These three bright stars, along with a 4th mag 10 star, form a prominent 11' chain angling NW-SE.   On images, NGC 1886 is a miniature version of NGC 891 with a box/peanust-shaped bulge.  Located 54' NW of M79.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 394x; moderately bright, fairly small, elongated NNW-SSE, 40" diameter.  This cluster consists of two "knots".  The brighter knot on the northwest side appears to have a stellar or quasi-stellar nucleus.  A mag 13-13.5 is just off the west-northwest edge, 0.7' NE and another mag 13.5 star is 1' SSE.  Mag 9.5 HD 271126 is 2.8' NNE and mag 9.1 HD 35141 is 9.5' E.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1891 = h2811 on 26 Dec 1835 and called it "A large scattered cluster, which more than fills the field.  Stars 10...12m.  Place that of a double star [HJ 3753], the chief star."  His position corresponds with mag 9.3 SAO 195771 at 05 21 16.3 -35 42 56.

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this galaxy shines through the northern  portion of the LMC!  At 166x, it appeared very faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, 0.9'x0.3' with just a weak concentration.  A very faint star is just south of the following end.  Located 37' NE of the bright LMC young globular NGC 1866.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1892 = h2815 on 30 Nov 1834 and reported "vF; pL; lE in parallel; vglbM; 2' l; 9" br."  On a second sweep he recorded "pF, pL, elongated in parallel; 90", 50"; has a star or two in it."   In 1926, Robert Innes described it visually as a "very elongated nebula, 45? to 225?, 12th mag; 30" broad, 2' long." (26-inch refractor, Union Observatory). The Hodge-Wright Atlas claims the RA is off by 1 tmin, but it is correctly marked on the Atlas and the NGC position is accurate.

05 22 45 +33 25 12; Aur

V = 7.5;  Size 11'


24" (1/4/14): at 200x, this bright, young cluster contains 80-100 stars, with the richest portion forming a large boomerang-shaped region extending 12'x5' N-S.  The outline is slightly concave to the west and convex to the east with a narrow denser region in the center with several pairs and trios.  NGC 1893 is the core of the Aur OB2 association and contains a number of massive O-type stars including 9th mag O4-type HD 242908 at the NW tip of the "boomerang" and 9.4-mag HD 24296 (O6-type star) forming the SW tip of the outline.  In the rich central region is 9.8-mag O7-type HD 242935, and the brightest component of the multiple star Bu 887, with two fainter companions at ~10" separation.  Just 1.4' NNW of this triple is a 14" of mag 10.4/11.4 stars, with brighter component BD+33 1025, an O8-type star.  Also 2.4' SE is a 10" pair of mag 11.4/12.4 stars. In addition, many other stars appear to be arranged in pairs and strings, so the cluster has a striking appearance.  These and other hot O and B-type stars in the cluster ionize the large emission nebula IC 410, which is quite impressive using a UHC filter (see separate description).


The cometary "Tadpoles" nebulae Simeis 130 and 129, which contain recently minted stars, lie on the east end of the cluster.  The "head" of Simeis 130 was immediately picked up at 200x as a very small, fairly high surface brightness knot with at least one star involved.  At 260x and 375, two very close "stars" oriented WSW-ENE were embedded in the glow, with the ENE object quasi-stellar (would not focus to a sharp point) and perhaps a very tight pair. Although impressive on images, there was no sign of the wavy tail extending from the "head" towards the NE.  Mag 9.1 BD+33 1028, 3' E of Simeis 130, along with a 6' group of a half-dozen mag 10-11 stars, were visually detached to the NE of the main cluster.


48" (10/27/19): just west of the cluster was a noticeable dark nebula, ~3' in diameter and it provided a striking contrast with the rich cluster immediately to its east and northeast.


13.1" (2/25/84): about 40 mostly faint stars, elongated N-S in poor transparency.  Located within a triangle of three mag 8 stars.  The emission nebula IC 410 is involved.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1893 = h351 on 22 Jan 1827 (sweep 51) and described a "rich coarse cluster of scattered stars 9...15m; more than fills field."  There is nothing at his position but exactly 3 tmin of RA west is a cluster embedded in the HII region IC 410.  JH didn't mention any nebulosity in his description, so the number should just apply to the cluster only, with IC 410 referring to the nebula. The error in position was copied by JH into the GC and by Dreyer into the NGC.  In the 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", Karl Reinmuth gave an corrected RA (noting it with an asterisk).

18" (11/22/03): at 115x, this is a scattered group of two dozen or more stars (depending on assumed dimensions) situated northeast of mag 8.6 SAO 77158.  The group is elongated NW-SE, ~10'x4' in size, although the borders of the group are arbitrary.  Includes 10 brighter mag 10-12 stars.  The declination given in the RNGC is 9 degrees too far south (listed as nonexistent).


William Herschel discovered NGC 1896 = H VIII-4 = h353 on 17 Jan 1784 (sweep 76) and recorded "a cl of scattered stars with small ones intermixed; it is about 3/4 nf Beta Tauri."  His summary description (from 3 observations) reads "a cluster of coarse and irregularly scattered pretty large stars." His position is accurately placed in this scattered group of stars.


On 24 Dec 1827 (sweep 115), John Herschel logged, "the most condensed part of a poor cl divded into two.  It consists of 20 or 30 stars 9...12m." His position is only given roughly, but is just off the southeast side.  JH made a typo copying the NPD into the GC, where it is 9? too far south and Dreyer passed along this error into the NGC.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent and uses the erroneous NGC position.  Lynga does not list a cluster at Herschel's position, so this group is probably an asterism and Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, also adds "no distinct Cl."

Set within a rich background glow from the LMC, 12' W of NGC 1918, a large nebulous cluster.  Open cluster S-L 363 is 6' E and NGC 1894 is 12' NNW.  NGC 1898 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1898 = D 124 on 27 Sep 1826 and recorded "a very small round nebula, about 12" diameter."  He made 2 observations and his position is 5' SW of this LMC globular.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1899 = h2821 on 30 Dec 1836 and reported as "F; R; vgbM; 40"; 3 stars 10' [approximate] mag precede."


Eric Lindsay reports "Not found" in his 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud".  Nevertheless, there appears to be a small very faint star and nebulosity (Henize 120-N 36) on the red DSS2 2' SE of Herschel's position. The Hodge-Wright Atlas states "possibly Henize 36".  Two mag 11 stars and a mag 12.7 star precede LHA 120-N 36, roughly agreeing with "3 stars 10' m precede."  See Harold Corwin's notes for more on this number.

The central grouping, extending 7'x2.5', is the most compressed with ~15 stars (7 of these are fairly bright).  Perhaps 40 stars total within 15', including 10 brighter stars.  The brightest stars are mag 8.4 HD 35294 in the central group and mag 7.6 HD 35230 on the southwest end.  This sparse Milky Way cluster (neither of the two brightest stars are members) is superimposed on the LMC.  The LMC cluster S-L 359, just 1.3' WSW of the mag 8.4 star, was not seen.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1901 = h2824 on 30 Dec 1836 and described "a star 7th mag. The most southern and largest of a large, brilliant but poor cluster which fills the field. Stars 8, 9 ... 12th mag."  His position is close west of mag 7.6 HD 35230.


In "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (1964IrAJ....6..286L) Eric Lindsay comments, "Centered on CPD -68?347. A dozen fairly bright stars, of which CPD 68?347 is the brightest and most southern, scattered within 11' diameter. Could hardly be considered a cluster and resembles mroe nearly a field irregularity."  The brighter field stars are not associated with the LMC.  But "A stellar group in line of sight with the Large Magellanic Cloud." (1968AJ.....73..566S) concludes, "BV photometry of a stellar group first noticed by Bok in line of sight with the Large Magellanic Cloud indicates that the group is real.  An H-R diagram shows an apparent main sequence with a turnoff near A0."

At 350x, it appeared very bright, ~1' diameter, with a blazing 20" core.  Perhaps 20 stars were resolved in the halo at this power with a single brighter star at the edge of the core on the south side.  NGC 1916, another bright globular, lies 8' SE.  NGC 1903 is situated in a wonderful section of the LMC; panning south and to the west yields field upon field filled with both bright and fainter clusters of all sizes, along with nebulous HII glows.

13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): excellent view at 200x.  Contains an intense, 1' core that was mottled and partially resolved, particularly around the edges.  The halo was easily resolved with several dozen brighter members peppered within the halo and around the periphery (~40 stars counted) although there were no dense knots.  Surrounding the inner core (nucleus) is a dense ring of high surface brightness which was very mottled.  In good moments of seeing this ring broke up into a swarm of stars.  Located 40' ENE of 5th magnitude h3752, a striking mag 5.5/6.7 pair at 3".


17.5" (1/9/99): at 280x, M79 is well resolved into several dozen stars.  Contains a sharply concentrated intense core, ~2' in diameter which is clumpy, mottled and partially resolved at its periphery.  The inner part of the halo is peppered with faint stars.  The background haze drops off significantly towards the outer portion of the halo but a number of brighter stars are resolved including a nice arc of stars along the following edge of the halo.  A evenly matched close pair is on the northeast side and a mag 12 star (a post-AGB star that belongs to the cluster) is at the north edge.  Located 35' NE of naked-eye 5th magnitude h3752 (5.5/6.7 at 3").


17.5" (12/8/90): 40-50 stars resolved mostly in the halo or at the edge of the very mottled core.  A string of six stars is just east of center and a long string passes through the core.  The brightest mag 12.5 star is north of the core.


17.5" (12/3/88): three dozen stars resolved, mostly at the edges of the core and in the halo.


17.5" (12/19/87): at 220x, three dozen stars were resolved.


13" (1/19/85): at 360x, about 40 stars resolved in good seeing including a few over the core.


8" (9/25/81): small bright core, a few stars are resolved at the edge of the mottled core.  The outer halo is well resolved in excellent conditions.


Pierre M?chain discovered M79 = NGC 1904 on 26 Oct 1780.  He reported it to Messier, who confirmed its position, and included it in his 1780 catalogue.  Wolfgang Steinicke reports that William Herschel first observed the cluster on 4 Mar 1783 (before his sweeps) with his 6.2-inch reflector.  On 17 Nov 1784, WH recorded M79 as "a fine cluster of stars, near 3' dia.  Extremely compressed but completely resolved." On 13 Jan 1806, he observed with his "Large 10 feet" and logged "The 79th of the Connoiss. is a cluster of stars of a globular construction, and certainly extremely rich. Towards the centre the stars are extremely compressed, and even a good way from it. With 171 the diameter is a little less than 1/3 of the field, and with 220 a little more; the field of one being 9'0", and of the other 8'0", a mean of both gives the diameter of the cluster 2'50", but I suppose that the lowness of the situation prevents my seeing the tiny scattered stars, so that this cluster is probably larger than it appears."

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright LMC cluster, fairly small, round, 30" diameter.  Contains an irregular, small knotty nucleus that was unresolved.  NGC 1895 (HII region) lies 9' WSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1905 = h4016 on 2 Jan 1837 and described as "F, S, R, r[esolved].  It was catalogued in a "supplementary nebulae" list of objects at the end of the Cape catalogue (h4016 to h4021) and identified as "h o n" (John Herschel Omitted Object) in the NGC.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1906 = LM 1-148 on 12 Nov 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is essentially correct (0.2 tmin too far east).  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 21 Feb 1889 as well as Howe in 1899-00 using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory (repeated in the IC 2 notes).

William Herschel discovered NGC 1907 = H VII-39 = h354 on 17 Jan 1787 (sweep 693) and noted "a pretty compressed cluster of small stars, near 4' diameter."  John Herschel made three observations and reported on 5 Jan 1827 (42), "p Rich; irreg R; stars 9...12m, 50 or 60 counted; bM."

William Herschel discovered NGC 1908 = H V-33 on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518) and reported "I suspect diffused eF milky nebulosity.  The means of verifying this phenomenon are difficult."


On 15 Jan 1868, Lord Rosse was "unable to say whether any diffused neby exists here.  At the set there was a spot about 10' diam or so, where there was almost total absence of stars when compared with the surrounding parts, and either from this cause or some other, it was rather *darker*."  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey Die Herschel-Nebel, reported "not found" and Harold Corwin, using the PSS, also reports no obvious nebulosity.  So, NGC 1908 is either lost or nonexistent.  See Corwin's notes for more information.

NGC 1909

05 25.9 -08 07; Ori


= Not found, Corwin.  Nominal position given.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1909 = H V-38 on 20 Dec 1786 (sweep 656) and recorded "strongly suspected nebulosity of very great extent.  Not less than 2 degrees 11' of PD and 26s of RA."  So, this "suspected nebulosity" stretched across several fields!  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates was unable to find Herschel's nebulosity.  Originally Corwin suggested this giant north-south nebuosity may refer to IC 2118, the Witch Head Nebula  WH's rough position of H V-36 is ~23 minutes of RA to far east but if his offset direction from Rigel was reversed (roughly 11 min of RA west instead of 11 min of RA east), then his corrected position would be a reasonable match with IC 2118.  But it turns out the Herschel observed H. V-38 11 minutes after Rigel left the field, so obviously it can refer to IC 2118, which is well west of Rigel.  So, this is apparently a case where Herschel was misled by subtle irregularities in the background sky or perhaps a reflection from a brighter star.

NGC 1910 = ESO 056-099 = S-L 371 = LH 41 = LMC-N119

05 18 42.5 -69 14 12; Dor

V = 9.7;  Size 10'


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this large, bright cluster or star cloud (stellar association LH 41) contains the variable star S Doradus (8.6-11.5), the brightest star in the LMC and one of the brightest known stars (absolute magnitude -9).  At 200x, roughly 100 stars mag 11-15 were resolved in a 7' region with some extensions increasing the diameter another couple of arc minutes.  S Doradus is the brightest star in the main portion of the cluster, though there are several other mag 11 and 12 stars.  S-L 360 is on the NW side (2' N of S Dor) and appeared as a small bright knot that was clearly non-stellar and surrounded by a thin, fainter halo (ring of faint stars on DSS).  HDE 269333, a mag 11.2 Wolf-Rayet binary (WN+B) lies 1.6' NNE of S-L 360.


The cluster is embedded in LMC-N119, a very large, bright emission nebula.  The most prominent section of the nebula is a very bright 3' patch to the east of S-L 360 and a wing to the south of S-L 360 that responds well to a UHC filter at 200x.  Nebulosity is also visible on the west side of S Doradus.  This section curves N-S to S-L 360 and also south of S Doradus.  To the south of NGC 1910, on a northwest to southeast stream extending a couple of degrees, are dozens of LMC clusters with NGC 1903, an impressive globular, situated 10' SW.  In a 1953 paper, Harlow Shapley and Virginia Nail defined NGC 1910 as the center of "Constellation V", a 24' region containing numerous blue supergiants.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1910 = D129 = h2827 on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta, New South Wales.  He described "A pretty large and very ill-defined nebula, of an irregular round figure, with several small stars in it."  His position is unusually accurate.


John Herschel first recorded it in Dec 1834 as a "fine cluster. Irregular figure, the chief nucleus (which seems to be a close double star, 9th mag) taken."  On a second sweep he called it "The most condensed knot ( = 12 arcseconds) in a pretty rich, L, scattered cluster." His third observation was recorded as "p rich L cluster 10' diameter. It has in it a close triple star, easily taken for a nebulous knot. (N.B. This is doubtless the knot taken in the three foregoing observations...)."

See observing notes for NGC 1920.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1911 = h2826 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "F; R; gbM; 30", among may stars."  He only logged this object on one sweep and there is nothing at his position.   Jenni Kay and Harold Corwin suggest NGC 1911 is probably be a duplicate observation of NGC 1920, which was recorded on 7 sweeps but not on the one in which he recorded NGC 1911.  JH's position is 80 sec of RA west of this cluster and his description is a reasonable match.


Eric Lindsay, in his 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" writes "Not found. This should be WNW of NGC 1920. This is No 2826 in Herschel's general Catalogue to which there is reference under NGC 1915."  RNGC follows Lindsay and classifies this number as nonexistent.  See Corwin's notes.

05 28 43 +35 51 18; Aur

V = 6.4;  Size 21'


18" (1/17/09): at 175x this gorgeous cluster extends 25'-30' in diameter and contains roughly 200 stars in many irregular groupings.  A very pretty string of stars extends N-S out the north side.  Includes a very large number of mag 10-12 stars (fairly uniform) with many of the stars group very irregularly in long chains and loops.  Some of these chains outline the periphery of nearly starless voids including the unconcentrated center which contains starless patches.  NGC 1907 is located 33' SSW, though the two clusters were likely born in different parts of the galaxy.


8": large, bright, rich cluster with many 10th magnitude stars, square or cruciform shape, includes a number of double stars.  A number of stars are arranged in strings.


Naked-eye (10/24/11): just glimpsed in very dark skies.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered M38 = NGC 1912 before 1654.  It was independently discovered by Le Gentil in 1749 and probably by Messier on 25 Sep 1764 (Le Gentil is not mentioned in his description).  WH observed the cluster on 23 Nov 1805 with the large 10-foot reflector and recorded "A cluster of scattered, pretty large [bright] stars of various magnitudes, of an irregular figure. It is in the Milky Way."

05 18 18.7 -69 32 15; Dor

V = 11.1;  Size 1.3'x1.1'


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an interesting LMC cluster and nebula at 200x.  On the south edge is a small triangle of mag 13-14 stars (12"-15" on each side) and another three stars within the cluster are resolved.  The cluster is involved an elongated bright nebulous glow NNW to SSE and at 350x additional nebulosity surrounds the main glow for a total size of 1.5'x1.0'.  A mag 11.7 star lies 1.7' E and a mag 10 star 2.2' SW.


Continuing southwest for 2' beyond the mag 10 star I also picked up S-L 362, which appeared as a small, high surface brightness knot.  At 350x, 5 or 6 very faint stars were tightly packed into the bright 20" diameter glow, the brightest at the south edge.  These clusters are within the glow of the central bar, so the background is relatively bright.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1913 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and recorded it as#356 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  No description was given in the GC or NGC but his position is just 1' SE of this small cluster.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 303x; fairly bright cluster and HII region, elongated NNW-SSE, at least a half-dozen stars resolved over an irregular glow extending 1.5'.  Good contrast gain with a NPB filter at 152x.  The size increases to ~2' and a small, very bright patch (LHa 120-N195A) is prominent on the northwest end.  A mag 12 star is 4' E.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1914 = h2830 on 3 Nov 1834 and described as "vF; L; irreg R; 3'."  On a second sweep he logged "F; pL; irreg fig; resolvable; 2' l, 90" br."  His mean position is accurate.

NGC 1915 = BSDL 1237

05 19 38.5 -66 47 59; Dor

Size 0.5'


24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly small knot of four mag 14-14.5 stars with perhaps some unresolved haze, ~40" diameter.  Appears to be an asterism only and unimpressive. Three mag 11-12 stars lie 2'-3' E and emission nebula NGC 1920 is 6' ENE.


This identification of NGC 1915 is very uncertain and this number may refer instead to open cluster ESO 085-SC71 located 4' N.  It also may be a duplicate observation of either NGC 1919 or 1920.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1915 = h2828 on 2 Jan 1837 and recorded "extremely faint, pretty large. (Possibly the same with No. 2826 [NGC 1911], but the nebulae are so crowded that they may with equal probability be different ones)."  Herschel's position is 4' S of ESO 085-SC71 and ESO identifies this cluster as NGC 1915.


Jenni Kay says a faint cluster exists at the original position and the ESO cluster is too small and faint.  On the DSS, there are only three mag 14 stars and a few very faint stars near Herschel's position, which to me was not eye-catching enough in the 24" to fit JH's description (mentioned to Corwin in a Feb 2014 email).  In the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud", Eric Lindsay reported "Not found. This should be WSW of NGC 1920...".   RNGC follows Lindsay and notes "Not Found".  So, the identification of this number is uncertain.  See Corwin's notes for further discussion.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this LMC globular was very bright, moderately large, round, symmetric, 45" diameter.  The center was sharply concentrated with a small blazing core!  NGC 1903, a showpiece globular, lies 8' NW.


NGC 1916 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.  It resides within the LMC's central bar, ~10' S of the large NGC 1910 complex, which contains S Doradus.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1916 = h2829 on 3 Nov 1834 and described "vB; vS; R; gbM; 20"."  His position (measured on 3 sweeps) is accurate.  Shapley and Lindsay ("A Catalogue of Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud", Irish Astronomical Journal, Vol. 6, 1963) give a diameter of 60'' and comment "NGC 1916, very condensed centre, unresolved."  The RA has a misprint 1 tmin too far west and this error was copied into the RNGC.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this LMC cluster (possible a globular) appeared fairly bright, fairly large, round, 1' diameter, with a broad concentration.  A 1' string of 3 faint stars to the east is collinear with the cluster.  S-L 397 lies 8' NE, and appeared as a compact, but relatively bright, elongated glow with an irregular or mottled surface, ~30" diameter.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1917 = D 130 on 25 Sep 1826 and described "a small round nebula."  His position is about 10' ESE of this cluster, certainly within his usual errors.  JH independently discovered NGC 1917 = h2831 on 16 Dec 1835 and recorded "vF, L, R, gvlbM, 1'."  His position (only recorded on this one sweep) is accurate.

NGC 1918 = LMC-N120C = LH 42

05 19 04.5 -69 38 56; Dor

V = 9.8;  Size 7'x4'


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a combination LMC cluster and nebula (contains an embedded SNR B0519-69.6) in the rich LMC central bar.  At 200x a striking double star (TDS 3145 = 11.6/11.8 at 9") sits within the glow with a third star in a line.  The brighter SW component is HD 35517 = Brey 22, a Wolf-Rayet binary. An additional 20 stars are resolved in the cluster (stellar association LH 42).


These stars are immersed in a diffuse nebulous glow that responds well to a UHC filter.  The brightest section is a patch just east of the double star (LMC-N120C), but nebulosity extends throughout the cluster as an elongated glow of ~5' length.  On images the nebulosity appears more like an arc or rim with some filamentary structure.


LMC-N127A, located 12' E, was observed in the 30" on 10/18/17.  At 264x this emission nebula was bright, compact, roundish, 40" diameter.  A star was visible at the center.  Very good response to the NPB (narrow-band) filter and displayed a slightly brighter central region and thin fainter outer halo.  Forms a "pair" with open cluster S-L 418 2' NE.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1918 = D 88 on 27 Sep 1826 and described a "small faint nebula, 25" or 30" diameter, with two small stars near the south side of it."  His position is about 13' too far SE, but the double star is within the nebula.


John Herschel independently discovered this nebula (SNR) between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and recorded it as #369 in his catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  Corwin notes Herschel's position falls between two bright knots near the supernova remnant.

The stars are involved in a fairly bright patch of nebulosity (LMC-N37), which probably including some unresolved stars.  A 6' elongated string of mag 11-12 stars is centered roiughly 3' N and NGC 1920 is 6' NNE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1919 = h2832 on 3 Jan 1837 and described a "cluster, 6th class, extremely faint, large, irregularly round, 4' diameter. Resolved into small stars with nebulous light."  His position (single sweep) is accurate.  NGC 1915 may be a duplicate observation (see that number).

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): bright, high surface brightness HII region, relatively large, round, ~50" diameter.  One or two stars are resolved within the glow.  NGC 1919 lies 6' SSW.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this HII region (LMC-N38) appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 35" diameter, smooth glow.  Located ~3' NE of a line of three mag 11-11.5 stars.  NGC 1902 lies 16' NW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1920 = h2833 on 2 Nov 1834 and observed on at least seven different sweeps!  On the initial observation he logged "pB, S, R, vgbM, 20"."  The remaining observations were fairly similar, though his size estimates ranged up to 60" and 2' across.  NGC 1911 (seen on only 1 sweep) is possibly a duplicate (essentially an 8th observation) -- though the RA is off by 1 min 20 sec.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 394x; moderately bright but small nebulous glow, with a mag 13.5 star [or an extremely compact emission nebula (N121) or cluster] just off the west edge [20" separation].  A very faint star was visible at its southwest edge.  There was only a weak response to an NPB filter at 152x.  Located at the south end of a very rich region of the LMC (south side of the central bar) just 8' S of the NGC 1918 complex.  Numerous other clusters lie ~15' N.  A faint cluster H-S 227 was noticed 2' SW. It's a very faint, small, roundish, low surface brightness glow, ~20" diameter.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1921 = h2834 on 12 Nov 1836 and recorded "vF; oval; r; 40"."  His position from a single sweep is accurate.


James Dunlop possibly discovered the cluster earlier on 24 Sep 1826 and recorded D 128 as "a small faint nebula, 1' north of a pretty bright star."  His position is within his usual errors - 8' WSW, but there is no "pretty bright star" 1' S, so I'm not confident of this identification  Perhaps this is another observation of NGC 1918 to the north.   Another possibility is NGC 1921 = D 89, described by Dunlop as "a pretty well-defined round nebula, about 20" diameter.  His position is 15' ESE of NGC 1921.  Without further information or a sketch, I can't see assigning a Dunlop number to this cluster.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this LMC cluster appears as a very small but high surface brightness knot, ~15" diameter with a tiny 8" core.  A 3' chain of four mag 11-12 stars extends to the north and another chain extends to the east.  A very close pair of faint clusters, S-L 385 and 387, lie 3' SW.  The clusters are close twins - both soft round glows of ~30" diameter and separated by just 45" in an E-W orientation.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1922 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and included it as object #374 his table of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  Dreyer included the cluster to the GC Supplement as GC 5063.  JH's position is 1.5' too far north.  It's possible that James Dunlop's D 131 refers to NGC 1922, but there are several nearby candidates, so assigning it to NGC 1922 seems very speculative.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1924 = H III-447 on 5 Oct 1785 (sweep 458) and recorded as "vF, pL, R, within 2 or 3' of the corner of a hook of vS stars."  It's interesting he classified this galaxy as a cluster.  His position is 3.6' south of MCG -01-14-011 = PGC 17319.

The brightest mag 9.6 star (HD 271182) is one the west side, a couple of mag 10.5 stars are on the south side and another is on the north end. At 105x and UHC filter, the nebulosity seems to increase a bit in contrast although on the DSS, nebulosity (LMC-N43) is only visible in the northern portion (which includes a supernova remnant).  NGC 1923 is located 18' N.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1925 = h2837 on 30 Nov 1834 and described a "Cluster 8th class; poor; scattered stars; a *10 mag the chief, in southern part taken."  His position is close to the brightest star on the south end.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright LMC cluster appeared moderately large, ~55" diameter, irregularly round with a high surface brightness.  Located between two mag 11.5 stars 1' S and 1.5' N.  Located along the central bar with NGC 1922 4.2' WNW and NGC 1928 3.4' NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1926 = h2838 on 3 Nov 1834 and recorded "pB; R; 60".  Situated in the main body of the Nubecula Major."  On a second observation he wrote "pB; pL; irreg R; r.  Field full of light, consisting partly of stars, and partly of resolvable nebula."   His position (on his first two sweeps) matches this cluster.


James Dunlop possibly discovered this object earlier on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector and recorded D 131 as "a very faint ill-defined small nebula."  His position is 2' NE of the cluster, but also just 1.7' S of NGC 1928, and I'd be surprised if Dunlop picked up one of these clusters and not the other.  Another possibility is his observation refers to NGC 1922, which is 5.6' W of his position.  Unless there is additional information on his observation, I don't see how an assignment can be made (Steinicke gives both NGC 1926 and 1928).

NGC 1927

= Not found, Carlson and Corwin.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1927 = h356 on 8 Jan 1831 and reported "all about this place there exists diffused nebulosity."  His position corresponds with mag 6.8 HD 36059, but there is no nebulosity in the vicinity of this star.  He equated his object with his father's H. V-38 (later NGC 1909), but that is either nonexistent or perhaps refers (according to Harold Corwin) to the Witchhead Nebula (IC 2118).  The observers at Birr Castle were unsuccessful on 4 attempts in finding h356, though twice a slight milkiness was suspected.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, states "not found" and this was repeated by Dorothy Carlson and the RNGC.  Harold Corwin also concludes this object is nonexistent.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x; fairly bright, fairly small, round, 40" diameter with a symmetrical appearance.  Forms the last of three clusters with NGC 1926 3.4' SW and NGC 1922 6' WSW, along the richly populated central bar.  A very distinctive trapezoid of four mag 10-11 stars (sides 1'-1.5') is just a couple of arc minutes to the NE.  NGC 1928 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1928 = h2839 on 3 Nov 1834 and recorded "pB; R; 60".  Situated in the main body of the Nubecula Major."  On a second observation he wrote "vF; R; gbM.  Field full of the nebulous light of the great Nubecula.  His position is accurate, though a second sweep placed it 20 sec of RA too far west.


James Dunlop possibly made an earlier observation of NGC 1928, recording it as D 131 on 3 Aug 1826 and reporting "a very faint ill-defined small nebula."  Dunlop made a single observation and his position is 1.7' S of NGC 1928.  But his position is just 2' NE of NGC 1926, which is slightly brighter, and I'm a bit surprised Dunlop would notice one of these clusters and not the other.  Another possibility is D 131 refers to NGC 1922, which is 5.6' W of his position.  Unless there is more unpublished information, I don't see how an assignment can be made (Steinicke gives both NGC 1926 and 1928).

V = 12.4;  Size 1.1'


24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this HII knot is the first in an impressive star cluster/emission complex (stellar association LH 47) that extends over 7' in size and includes NGC 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, and IC 2126.  At 260x it appeared as a bright, moderately large, round glow of ~50" diameter surrounding a 13th magnitude star.


On the DSS this object appears to be a symmetrical bubble.  This HII complex and cluster includes the Superbubble complex N44.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1929 = h2840 on 23 Nov 1834 and simply noted  "F.  The preceding nucleus of the compound nebula figured in fig. 2, Plate III.  Place by Delta RA and PD, from the chief nucleus measured on diagram."  The sketch clearly established this number refers to the northernmost knot in the complex along the west side.


James Dunlop discovered the LH 47 association = D 175, which contains NGC 1929, on 27 Sep 1826.  He described "a pretty large rather faint nebula, about 5' diameter, irregular figure, partly resolvable into stars of mixt magnitudes.  The nebulous matter has several seats of attraction, or rather it is a cluster of small nebulae with strong nebulosity common to all."  Dunlop's position is roughly 5' SSW of the complex, a good match for Dunlop, and NGC 1929 might be one of the "seats of attraction."


The SIMBAD position is 1.4' too far northeast and does not correspond with a bright knot.

18" (1/20/07): bright, high surface brightness nebula, ~2'x1.5', surrounds six stars including two mag 11/12 stars, a mag 13 star and three fainter stars.  The central 4 stars = ADS 4112 (one difficult in fairly poor seeing) form a small trapezium asterism.  The best view was unfiltered.  IC 417 lies 45' WNW.


17.5" (2/8/86): five stars including ADS 4112 (mag 11.5/12.3/13 at 8" and 10") are located within a bright, small nebulosity of high surface brightness.  A sixth very faint star is just outside the nebula.  Dims with OIII filter.


13" (11/5/83): five stars involved including three close fairly bright stars. A fourth very faint star to the west, fifth very faint star NE and sixth extremely faint star west.  This is a bright, high surface brightness nebulosity.


8" (11/8/80): compact, striking nebulosity involving several stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1931 = H I-261 = h355 on 4 Feb 1793 (sweep 1030) and recorded "vB, irr R, vgbM, about 4 or 5' diameter. Seems to have 1 or 2 stars in the middle or an irregular nucleus; the chevelure diminishes very gradually."  On 5 Jan 1827 (sweep 42), John Herschel reported "a triple star in a nebula.  A most curious object.  The nebula surrounds the stars like an atmosphere."


The observers using Lord Rosse's 72" reported 5 to 6 stars were involved on various nights.  The first observation was made by Johnstone Stonney on 29 Nov 1848, though he only noted "saw a multitude of stars and some unresolved nebulositiy."

John Herschel discovered NGC 1932 + 1933 = h2841 on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded "B; eS; bM; 10"."  On a later sweep he called it a "double nebula; pos 260?, 80".  The first pB; S; R; 30".  The second eF; R; almost stellar."  The second nebula was only recorded on one sweep (#538) out of 5 total.  Based on this description, though, JH assigned two GC numbers (1138 and 1139), which became NGC 1932 and 1933.  But there is only a single cluster at his position and Harold Corwin identifies NGC 1932 with a mag 13 star just west of the cluster.


Eric Lindsay, in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" [1964IrAJ....6..286L] writes "[NGC 1932 and NGC 1933] seem to be the same, a small compact fairly conspicuous open cluster, S/L 420. The supposedly fainter was observed in only one of five sweeps by Herschel. Dreyer therefore questioned it as a variable nebula."   ESO also identifies the cluster as NGC 1932 = NGC 1933 but only the latter number should apply to the cluster.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1933 + 1932 = h2841 on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded "B; eS; bM; 10"."   On the third of five sweeps, he described this object as "a double neb; pos 260 deg; dist 80", hence the two GC and NGC entries.  But there is only a single cluster at his position and Harold Corwin identifies NGC 1932 with a mag 13 star just west of the cluster and NGC 1933 with the cluster.  ESO and the S-L catalogue calls the cluster NGC 1932 = NGC 1933, though only a single number (NGC 1933) should apply to the cluster.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a locally brighter patch in the NGC 1929-34-35-36-37 complex (stellar association LH 47), situated immediately northwest of NGC 1935.  This patch is not as well defined as the other NGC objects in this bright HII complex but NGC 1935 is noticeable as it involves a mag 12 star and a number of fainter stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1934 = h2842 on 23 Nov 1834 and recorded "The second nucleus of the compound nebula figured in fig 2, Plate III, from diagram."  The resolution on the pdf of Herschel's sketch in the LMC is not sharp enough to identify which "knot" JH is referring to within the complex (NGC 1929, 1935, 1936, 1937).  At the position indicated here (from Corwin), there is nothing that stands out on the DSS or in my observation, other than a few stars.  The "LMC extended catalog" (Bica+, 1999) places the center of NGC 1934 2' further north and there is another "knot" near this position on JH's sketch.  James Dunlop discovered the entire LH 47 association = D 175, though NGC 1934 is probably not one of the "seats of attraction" in the description.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this emission glow forms a pair NGC 1936 just southeast in a very striking field of clusters and HII patches (part of stellar association LH 47).  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared as a very bright, round glow of uniform high surface brightness.  The size is slightly smaller than NGC 1936, perhaps 45"-50" in diameter.  Good response to the UHC filter.  Nebulosity (BSDL 1363) also extends off to the NW of NGC 1935 and a locally brighter patch (NGC 1934) involves a couple of brighter stars.


Superimposed on this entire complex of HII knots is a rich concentration of stars (S-L 417 = KMHK 822).  As John Herschel described NGC 1935 on one sweep as "one of the chief nuclei or knots of a large irregular cluster nebula", this number along with NGC 1936 could also apply to the cluster.  Nail and Shapley designated the OB association centered on NGC 1929, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 as "Constellation I" in a 1953 paper on the Magellanic Clouds


James Dunlop discovered the LH 47 association = D 175, consisting of NGC 1929, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937  on 27 Sep 1826.  He described "a pretty large rather faint nebula, about 5' diameter, irregular figure, partly resolvable into stars of mixt magnitudes.  The nebulous matter has several seats of attraction, or rather it is a cluster of small nebulae with strong nebulosity common to all."  Dunlop's position is roughly 5' SSW of the complex, so a good match (for Dunlop), although John Herschel didn't credit Dunlop as the discoverer.  It's probably safe to assume that two of these "seats of attraction" were NGC 1935 and NGC 1936 (JH only credited Dunlop with the latter).


John Herschel found NGC 1935 = h2843 on 23 Nov 1834 and recorded "B; S; R. One of the chief nuclei or knots of a large irregular cluster nebula."  He next logged it as "F, S, R. The third of a group of four nebulae connected by stars." His third observation saw it as "the second nebula of a group of three." His final sweep was recorded as "the first bright nebulous head of a large beautiful irregular cluster of resolved stars."  His detailed sketch is in Plate III, figure 2.


Williamina Fleming discovered the gaseous spectra of NGC 1935 on Harvard objective plates taken in 1901 at the Arequipa station and Dreyer catalogued Fleming 90 as IC 2126, although the IC position is just 5 sec of RA west of NGC 1935.  The Hodge-Wright LMC Atlas labels this nebula as IC 2126 instead of NGC 1935 (same with NGC 1936 = IC 2127).

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 1936 appeared as a very bright, round glow, ~1' diameter with a very high, uniform surface brightness at 200x using a UHC filter.  Situated at the south end of a large cluster and HII complex.  Additional fainter nebulosity sweeps to the south and is connected with a fainter (anonymous) patch to the west by 1'.  This extension increases the total size to 2' to 2.5'.  NGC 1935 lies 2' NW.  This number also applies to the cluster (S-L 417) that spreads out the north.  Mag 8.5 HD 35665 lies 7' W.


James Dunlop discovered the LH 47 association = D 175, consisting of NGC 1929, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937  on 27 Sep 1826.

It's probably safe to assume that two of these "seats of attraction" were NGC 1935 and NGC 1936, the brightest knots in the complex.


John Herschel observed NGC 1936 = h2844 on 23 Nov 1834 and recorded "pB; S; R.  Another chief nucleus or knot of the cluster nebula."  He next logged it as "pB, S, R, The fourth of a group of four, connected by stars, etc."  On the third sweep, he wrote "the third nebula in a group of 3." The 4th sweep saw it as "the last of three nebulae in a zig-zag formed cluster." On his 5th sweep, he noted "the southern and brightest nebular nucleus of a great branching cluster."  His detailed sketch of the entire complex is on Plate III, figure 2.


Williamina Fleming discovered the gaseous spectra of NGC 1936 on Harvard objective plates taken in 1901 at Arequipa and Dreyer catalogued Fleming 91 as IC 2127, although the IC position is just 4 sec of RA west of NGC 1936.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this object is the furthest northeast in a gorgeous field of stars and HII regions.  NGC 1937 is a large nebulous patch, ~3.7'x2.7' in size, with ~20 stars resolved over the bright glow.  Excellent contrast gain using a UHC filter at 200x. A string of stars mag 11.5 and fainter oriented WSW-ENE passes through the center of the cluster or star cloud (association LH 48).


NGC 1936, a very bright nebulous glow, lies 5' S, and other sections of the N44 superbubble complex lie to the southwest including NGC 1929, 1935 and IC 2126.  Superimposed on this complex of HII glows is a fairly rich concentration of stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1937 = h2845 on 23 Nov 1834 and recorded "vF; pL. An outlier of the group figured in Plate III No. 2. Place from diagram."  His detailed sketch (Plate III, figure 2) clearly established that h2845 refers to this nebulous cluster.  James Dunlop discovered the entire LH 47 association = D 175 on 27 Sep 1826 and referred to "several seats of attraction". I doubt that NGC 1937 was one of these, though Wolfgang Steinicke credits Dunlop with the discovery.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1938 + NGC 1939 = h2848 on 24 Nov 1834 and recorded a "B; R; a double nebula (clouding over)."  On a second observation he recorded "pB; S; R; glbM; a double neb.  It has a vF neb (NGC 1939) attached np."  On a third sweep (of 4) he logged "A double neb.  Pos 339.1; 50" dist; each F; R; glbM; 35" and 30"."  JH catalogued both objects individually in the GC (1144 and 1145).  See Corwin's notes for more on the clusters.


James Dunlop possibly discovered this "double cluster" on 24 Sep 1826 and described D 89 as a "pretty well-defined round nebula, about 20" diameter."  His position is ~5' NE of NGC 1938 and 1939.  Perhaps he noticed the combined glow of these clusters (though the size would then be much too small), or he picked up only NGC 1939, which is the brighter cluster.   Another possibility is D 90, described as "a small round faint nebula, north of a small star", refers to NGC 1938 and 1939.  His position is 13' SE of the pair of the clusters.  Without further information, I don't see how Dunlop can be confidently given credit for the discovery.

While looking for this cluster I picked up an unplotted cluster, Hodge-Sexton 253, situated 6.6' SE of NGC 1939 and 3.7' SE of the mag 10.7 star.  It appeared moderately bright, round, ~35" diameter, no significant concentration.  S-L 412, situated 7' N of NGC 1939, was a roundish, fairly faint glow, ~24" diameter.  In addtion, LMC-N127A lies 16' N of NGC 1939.  At 264x this emission nebula was bright, compact, roundish, 40" diameter, with a star visible at the center.  Very good response to the NPB (narrow-band) filter with a slightly brighter central region and thin fainter halo..  It forms a "pair" with open cluster S-L 418 2' NE.

James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1939 = D 89 on 24 Sep 1826 and described a "pretty well-defined round nebula, about 20" diameter."  His position is ~5' NE of NGC 1938 and 1939, a close pair of clusters.  Perhaps he noticed the combined glow of both clusters (though the size would then be too small), or he only picked up NGC 1939, which is the brighter cluster.

JH observed the pair of clusters (NGC 1938/1939 = h2848) on 24 Nov 1834 and described a "B; R; a double nebula (clouding over)."

James Dunlop recorded D 212 on 6 Nov 1826, noting a "small faint ill-defined nebula."  That's not much to go on and his position is 26' E of this cluster.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1942 = h2849 on 30 Nov 1834 and described "a star 14th mag, with an eF nebula about it." His second observation was recorded as "very faint. (Cloudy) (N.B. The PD has been probably spoiled by the clouds)".  But Herschel's second observation through the clouds has the correct PD and his first was off by ~3'.  Robert Innes and Willem van den Bos observed the cluster visually in 1926 with the 26.5-inch refractor at the Union Observatory.

I didn't use the NPD filter, but the red DSS shows some nebulosity is involved (LHA 120-N130).  NGC 1938 and 1939, a very close pair of clusters, lies 14' NNW.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1943 = D 91 = h2850 on 24 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector at Parramatta and described "a small round nebula, 12" or 15" diameter."  His position is 13' SE of the cluster.  Dunlop's D 90, described as "a small round faint nebula, north of a small star", may be another observation of this cluster.  His position for D 90 is just 5' NE of the cluster.

A mag 13.5-14 star is off the SW edge, a mag 15.5 star is at the NW edge.  Situated within a nice group of stars including four nearby mag 12.5 stars; 1.4' SE, 2' SSE, 2' N and 3.4' SE.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x unfiltered, this LMC HII region (N48E) appeared fairly faint, fairly small, ~30" diameter.  The shape is irregular and brighter along the south edge.  NGC 1946 lies 4.4' NE.  Several mag 11-13 stars are in the field to the northwest and these seem to stream 10' to the northeast direction, heading towards NGC 1948, a magnificent star cloud and HII complex.  NGC 1951, a bright cluster, lies 11' SE and NGC 1941 is 12' NW.  These objects are located on the west side of the huge LMC-4 Superbubble.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1945 = h2851 on 3 Jan 1837 and reported "eeF, vvL.  Great blotches of diffused nebulosity."  I logged a small, brighter patch of nebulosity on the south side of a large annular ring or loop of nebulosity.  Herschel's description implies a much larger object than I described, though his position is an excellent match with this patch.  I'd be surprised if he picked up the entire loop so perhaps the richness of the star field mimicked "diffused nebulosity".  See Harold Corwin's notes on this number.


Karl Henize in the 1956 "Catalogues of Hydrogen Alpha Emission Stars and Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds" (ApJS 2, p315), notes his object LHa N120-48 "includes NGC 1945."  LHa N120-48 measures 12.3' east-west and 15.2' north-south. It has a slightly irregular outline, is very elongated and shows appreciable structure. LHa N120-48E (33" x 36", somewhat irregular outline, considerably elongated) lies at the centre of NGC 1945.

05 25 16 -66 23 42; Dor

V = 12.6;  Size 1.0'


24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): bright LMC cluster, fairly small, irregularly round, high surface bright glow, 30" diameter.  Although this knot was not resolved, it is situated in a glorious rich star field surrounded by numerous stars.  A stream of stars, oriented SW to NE, seems to pass through NGC 1946, extending southwest to NGC 1945 (4.4' SSW) and northeast to NGC 1948, a magnificent star cloud and HII complex ~8' NNE.  A brighter, parallel stream, consisting of stars of mixed magnitudes and unresolved glow (stars or nebulosity) is roughly 3' W, extending at least 10' SW to NE.


S-L 470 lies 7' E.  Observed with a 25" on 4/3/19 it appeared bright, fairly small, round, compact, 35" diameter, contains a very small bright nucleus.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1946 = h2854 on 3 Jan 1837 and recorded "pF, R, gbM, resolvable."  Herschel credits Dunlop with the discovery (D 237), though in the GC and NGC a question mark was added.  Dunlop's position matches this cluster very well though the description "a rather large faint nebula, 3' or 4' diameter, of an irregular round figure, no central attraction" implies a much larger object  -- probably NGC 1948, whose center is just 6' NNE of his position.

18" (4/6/16 - Coonabarabran, 236x): fairly bright and large, slightly elongated, ~2.5'x2.0', well concentrated with a bright core that gradually increased to the center.  A mag 9.7 star (HD 36355) lies 4.2' NNW. The LMC cluster NGC 1942 lies 17' SW and S-L 509 is 21' NE.


S-L 509 appeared  fairly faint, fairly large, irregular glow, ~1.2' diameter, mottled. A mag 14.5 star is resolved at the SW edge of the glow and a mag 15.5 star is at the north edge.


24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very bright, large, round, contains a large, very bright core surrounded by a fainter halo with a total diameter of ~3'.  Within the brighter 2' core is a sharply concentrated brighter nucleus.  This is an impressive S0 or E-galaxy at 200x due to the high surface brightness core and several brightness levels.  Situated in the northern outskirts of the LMC with S-L 509, a faint LMC cluster, 21' NE.  On images, the minor axis of this elliptical is bisected by a dust lane, though this feature wasn't noticed.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1947 on 5 Nov 1826 with his 9" reflector although the observation was not included in his 1828 catalogue.  Glen Cozens found the observation by examining Dunlop's handwritten notes.  John Herschel independently discovered this galaxy on 30 Nov 1834 and described h2855 as "pB, L, R, glbM; 2.5' diameter, a star 9th mag N.p.".  There is nothing at his position but exactly 1 degree north is ESO 85-87, an unusual elliptical with a minor-axis dust lane, and mag 9.7 HD 36355 (matching his description) is 4.4' NNW.


Due to his erroneous position, Joseph Turner was unable to find it when he searched for it on 12 Dec 1878 with the 48-inch Melbourne Telescope.  Interestingly, Pietro Baracchi was unsucessful in finding NGC 1947 on two attempts with the Melbourne telescope, but reported finding a new nebula nearby (perhaps S-L 556) on 3 Jan 1886 that was confirmed the next night (no sketch to confirm).  Robert Innes and Willem van den Bos observed it visually in 1926 with the 26-inch refractor at the Union Observatory and assumed the galaxy was a globular cluster and compared it to 47 Tucanae!  Innes wrote, "very condensed globular, bM, 2' diam, a miniature of [47 Tuc]."


Eric Lindsay, in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (1964IrAJ....6..286L), notes "The Decl. [recorded by Herschel] seems to be in error and the object is the well-known galaxy 1? N."  In a paper on LMC clusters, Kontizas et al misidentifies KMH90-878 as NGC 1947 because of the dec error, though there doesn't appear to be a cluster on the DSS at the Kontizas position.

05 25 46 -66 15 51; Dor

V = 10.6;  Size 8'


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a large, well-resolved star cloud (stellar association LH 52) and emission nebula.  The richest section is ~8' diameter, with a roughly diamond shape.  Approximately 60 stars were resolved at 260x over haze.  A fairly large, nebulous knot (LMC-N48B) was visible on the southwest side, ~1.2' diameter, and it responded well to a UHC filter.  A couple of other very small knots or clumps of stars were visible at the center (LMC-N48A and N48C).  Two parallel streams of stars and unresolved haze (roughly 3' apart), oriented SW to NE, extended southwest from NGC 1948 through NGC 1946 to NGC 1945.  The western string was brighter, consisting of a number of mag 12-14 stars along with an unresolved glow (stars and/or nebulosity) extending at least 10'.  These objects are located on the west side of the huge LMC-4 Superbubble.


LMC-N49, located 11' NNE, is the brightest LMC supernova remnant and it harbors a powerful pulsar.  At 260x unfiltered, it appeared as a bright "U" shape just under 1' in diameter with the center of the "U" at the east end (base oriented SW-NE) and open on the west side.  The interior is much dimmer than the rim.  The brightest spot is right at the east end, though the rim is much brighter and better defined along the entire base.  The northern bar of the "U" side is fainter and oriented NW-SE with some haze spreading into the interior.  The southern bar is brighter and narrower.  A UHC filter increased the contrast and there were hints of more complex filamentary structure.  Located 3.7' ENE of mag 9.0 HD 36257.  Open cluster S-L 463, which appears as a very small knot attached to a star, is located 2.4' NE.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this is a fairly large star group in the LMC.  Over a dozen mag 12-13 stars are resolved in a triangular group, ~6' diameter, over unresolved background haze or possibly nebulosity.  NGC 1978, a bright "blue globular", lies 18' E.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1948 = D 237 on 6 Nov 1826 with his 9" reflector and described a "a rather large faint nebula, 3' or 4' diameter, of an irregular round figure; no central concentration.  His position is about 6' SW of NGC 1948, certainly within his usual errors, and his size estimate (3' or 4') is reasonable.  Another possible assignment is NGC 1945 = D 237, situated a similar distance south-southwest of his position.  But NGC 1945 is much smaller (roughly 30"), so this seems much less likely to me, though Glen Cozens suggests the possible equivalence with D 237.


JH independently discovered NGC 1948 = h2856 on 3 Jan 1837 and described "a rich, discrete cluster, class VII. Not much compressed to the middle; 10' diameter, stars of 13th mag."  His position is accurate.  Herschel didn't credit Dunlop as the discoverer and neither did Dreyer in the NGC.

V = 12.4


30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): very bright, fairly small, round, high surface brightness, ~35" diameter.  No resolution, though this is primarily an emission nebula.  A string of 3 mag 13.7/12.8/13 stars extend to the southwest by 45", 2.2' and 3.4'.  I was very surprised when I added an NPB filter at 152x.  A fairly prominent, large (~1.3' diameter), round emission nebula was nearly attached on the southwest side!  This nebula (considered part of LHA 120-N 138A) surrounds a mag 13.6 star at its center and has a slightly brighter rim. Together with NGC 1949 the pair nearly forms a "diamond ring".


Using the NPB filter, LHA 120-N 138C was also seen 1.8' W as a very faint, fairly small, 25" glow.  It surrounds a mag 15.2 star that was not seen with the filter.  Much brighter is N 138B, located 5.2' SW of NGC 1949.  With the filter it appeared fairly bright, small, round, 20" diameter, crisp-edged.  A mag 15 star is attached at the southwest edge.  This interesting field is located 14' NW of mag 6.1 HD 36584 (equal mag 1.3" pair).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1949 = h2857 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "pB; S; R; psbM; 20"."  His position (single sweep) is accurate and appears to described the small, high surface brightness nebula only.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a group of clusters including NGC 1958, 1959, 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1986, towards the SE end.  These clusters reside in a dense part of the LMC bar with a bright background glow.  NGC 1950 forms the southwest vertex of a triangle with NGC 1959 5.5' ESE and NGC 1958 6.3' NE.  At 260x it appeared moderately bright, fairly large, ~2' diameter, with a relatively low surface brightness.  At 346x, several extremely faint stars pepper the surface of the cluster.  A mag 11 star lies 3' E, within the triangle described above.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1950 = h2859 on 23 Dec 1834 and described as "The first of several nebulae running together [along with 1958, 1959, 1969, 1971 and NGC 1972] and forming a very remarkable group, which fills the field with a faint diffused nebulosity. See plate IV, figure 7." His second description reads: "A large ill-defined patch at the lower edge of the Nubecula Major, which is pretty definite here, and very bright."  His position (measured on 2 sweeps) is accurate.

S-L 465, situated just 1.8' NNE of center, appeared moderately faint, round, compact, contains a very small bright core.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, small, round, 25" diameter, well-concentrated with a 10" bright core (John Herschel described the core as a close double star).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1951 = h2858 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "B, R or lE; binuclear or sbM to a double star 10th and 11th mag." His second observation was recorded as "A close first class D star, 10th and 11th mag, with a thick nebulous mist like dust about it."  His first position is accurate.  Shapley and Lindsay ("A Catalogue of Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud", Irish Astronomical Journal, Vol. 6, 1963) give a diameter of 80'' and remark "elongated, inner condensed, outer resolved."

V = 8.5;  Size 6'x4'


48" (10/23/14): remarkable intricate filamentary structure at 488x using a DGM Optics OIII filter.  I didn't try to take detailed notes, but the entire surface of  M1, which filled over half the field, was resolved into an intertwined maze of thin, twisting filaments.  This complex structure was more evident than the view I had a year ago at 287x.


48" (11/2/13): using 488x I immediately focused in on a close unequal mag double star (roughly mag 16/16.5) that was visible near the center but a bit offset from the geometric center towards the SE side of the nebula.  The fainter southwest component (CM Tau) is the famous pulsar (rotating neutron star) at the heart of the Crab Nebula, which was discovered in 1968 and pulses 30 times/sec!


Although this observation was exciting (first definite view of the pulsar), the real jaw-dropping sight was at 287x using a DGM Optics OIII filter, which lit up the interior filaments!  The two bright filaments that meander E-W through the nebula (dipping just south of the pulsar) were very prominent with slightly fainter side filaments extending south and north.  Scanning with averted vision, numerous additional very faint, thin radial filaments extending outward were evident throughout the nebula.  In addition, the periphery had a ragged or curdled appearance, particularly along the northern edge. The eypiece view approached the iconic HST image of the Crab Nebula !


18" (11/14/09): at 175x and OIII filter an obvious brighter filament is visible that begins just south of center and extends WNW towards the west end.  This filament is brightest (or has a brighter knot) at its eastern end near the center.  A fainter filament begins near the same point south of center and extends towards the NE.  The two filaments, if joined as one, extend nearly from the west end of the Crab Nebula to the east.


18" (2/23/06): at 225x the shape was quite elongated and irregular and the interior had a turbulent appearance due to a very irregular surface brightness.  The periphery has a tattered or ragged edge and changes shape somewhat with averted vision.  With a UHC filter, there is a brighter knot (sometimes appears as an extended, elongated feature) near the SW edge.


17.5" (2/8/86): very bright, unusual potato shape with an irregular surface brightness, 6'x4', broad concentration towards center.  Very irregular elongated shape with extensions or "arms" towards the NW and SE, ragged edges at periphery.  A large dark indentation or "bay" intrudes on the NE side of the SE extension, so this end is thinner and less prominent.  A few faint stars are superimposed.  Using an OIII filter, the overall structure is muted but a bright inner streak is visible in the SW quadrant (oriented ~E-W) and this streak is not noticeable without the filter.


13.1" (1/18/85): large, bright, irregular potato shape, large indentation on following end.  Easy in 16x80 finder.


8" (10/4/80): moderately bright, irregular shape, fairly large, indentation on the NW and SE ends.


15x50mm IS binoculars (2/23/06): easily visible as a faint, oval patch.


John Bevis discovered M1 = NGC 1952 = h357 around 1731 using a 3-inch (+/-) refractor of 24 ft focal length. He labeled it as a nebula in his Uranographia Britannica star atlas, which was completed in 1750, though not published in 1786.  Charles Messier independently discovered M1 on 28 Aug 1758.  While searching for comet Halley on its first predicted return, he found instead another comet, which turned out to have been discovered earlier.  Then while tracking this comet he found M1, which Messier noted "contains no star; it is a whitish light, elongated like the flame of a taper."  Bevis informed Messier of his earlier discovery in 1771.  Messier?s rediscovery of M1 was the inspiration to begin the compilation of his catalog.


William Herschel made numerous observations with his various telescopes, though first observed it on 24 Mar 1783 with this 6.2-inch reflector.  With his workhorse 18.7-inch he attempted to resolve the nebula into stars: "Very bright, of an irregular figure; full 5 minutes in longest direction. I suspect it to consist of stars."


Much of the following is gleaned from Wolfgang Steinicke's book on "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters". William Parsons (third Earl of Rosse) and friends Romney Robinson and James South observed M1 with his first (compound) 36-inch in early November 1840. A few weeks later Robinson wrote Rosse to examine other nebulae as "I am anxious to know whether they all have tails and claws".  Parsons sketched M1 in 1844 (using his solid 36") with filaments or streamers extending out of the body and a long tail (see http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_rosse.html). His description reads:  ".. a cluster; we perceive in this [36-inch telescope], however, a considerable change of appearance; it is no longer an oval resolvable [mottled] Nebula; we see resolvable filaments singularly disposed, springing principally from its southern extremity, and not, as is usual in clusters, irregularly in all directions. Probably greater power would bring out other filaments, and it would then assume the ordinary form of a cluster. It is stubbed with stars, mixed however with a nebulosity probably consisting of stars too minute to be recognized. It is an easy object, and I have shown it to many, and all have been at once struck with its remarkable aspect. Everything in the sketch can be seen under moderately favourable circumstances."


Romney Robinson, director of Armagh Observatory and a regular observer at Birr Castle, remarked "it is ragged, bifurcated at the top, and has streamers running out like claws in every direction."  This description, along with the 1844 sketch, probably led the popular nickname "Crab Nebula".


William Lassell was certainly influenced by the sketch.  He observed M1 in December 1852 with his 24" reflector and commented, "long filaments run out on all sides".  Three weeks later, he noted "the outlying claws are only just circumscribed by the edge of the field of 6' in diameter."  Father Angelo Secchi was also influenced; his sketch made around 1856 using a 9.5" refractor strikingly mimics the 1844 sketch with a long tail and external feelers!  Secchi claimed the agreement in features demonstrated the strength of his telescope.


Interestingly, R.J. Mitchell resketched the Crab in 1855 with a much more traditional shape.  Dreyer commented in The Observatory, Vol. 37, p. 399-402 (1914), "The only published drawing which is a complete failure, is that of M1, the "Crab Nebula", which has unfortunately been reproduced in many popular books.  It was made with the 3-foot, and long "feelers" were never again seen with the 3-foot nor with the 6-foot."  Still the nickname stuck.  See More http://www.southastrodel.com/NGC1952.htm for more historical observations.


Isaac Roberts first captured M1 photographically in 1892 with his 20-inch reflector.


In 1921 Carl Lampland suspected internal motion and based on plates with the the 40-inch reflector at Lowell, showed the nebula had changed shape.  He also discovered the close double star at the center (5" separation).


Also in 1921 Lundmark mentioned (PASP, 33, 234) that the nova of 1054 was near NGC 1952 and in 1928 Edwin Hubble (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1928ASPL....1...55H) stated the nebula "is expanding rapidly and at such a rate that it must have required about 900 years to reach its present dimensions.  For, in the ancient accounts of celestial phenomena only one nova has been recorded in the region of the Crab Nebula.  This account is found in the Chinese annals, the position fits as closely as it can read, and the year was 1054!"  The Chinese text noted "Thereafter, a "guest star" appeared on 4 Jul


In 1937 Nicholas Mayall made a spectral analysis (PASP, 49, 101) and in 1939 (ASPL, Vol 3, 145) announced the Crab Nebula was a supernova remnant.


In 1951 Australian astronomer John Bolton showed that M1 was a strong radio source (brightest in Taurus) and was named Taurus A.  In 1968 a pulsar (rapidly rotating neutron star) was discovered in M31 with a period of 33 milliseconds (southwestern of the two central mag 16.5 stars).

A mag 13 star is superimposed 45" N of center and a mag 13.8 star is 1.3' NW (outside the halo).


NGC 1954 is the brightest in a trio (HDCE 361) at a distance of ~150 million years with NGC 1957 4.5' SSE and IC 2132 9.5' NNW.  The three galaxies are nearly collinear.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): this cluster and emission nebula is near the western end of a beautiful curved chain of bright clusters involved with prominent nebulosity (referred to as the "Sextant Arc") that extends 17' WSW to ENE and includes NGC 1966 and NGC 1974 to the NE and S-L 456, a group of stars and nebulosity 4' W of NGC 1955.


The cluster, which is part of stellar association LH 54, includes as many as 40 stars in a 4' region including a half-dozen mag 11.5-12.5 stars in a 3' gently curving arc elongated E-W.  Near the W end of this arc is mag 11.6 HD 36402 = Brey 31, a Wolf-Rayet binary (WC-type).


The cluster is immersed in a large, irregular haze that was brightest on its eastern side in a 30" circular glow.  This patch is just a locally brighter section of a large irregular loop bowed out to the east and extending N-S for 6'-7' to a mag 9.5 star 3.5' S of the cluster.


A fainter group of stars and haze lies 4' W (S-L 456 within association LH 51) and the DSS reveals both halves are the brightest portions of an 8' superbubble (LHa 120-N51D).  NGC 1968 lies ~8' ENE and NGC 1974 11' NE.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1955 = D 211 on 3 Aug 1826 and described "a small faint elliptical nebula, about 20" diameter. This is the preceding in a curved line of six or seven small nebulae, of unequal magnitudes."  Dunlop made 4 observations and his position is just 1.6' too far SE.  JH called NGC 1955 = h2863 "The second of a great line of rich clusters [NGC 1968, 1974 and 1991] which are connected by abundant scattered stars. (The first not taken)."  The first is probably S-L 456.  JH credited Dunlop with the discovery.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): excellent, fairly large edge-on at 200x, ~2.0'x0.6'.  Sharply concentrated with a small, round bright core and much fainter extensions WSW-ENE.  A faint star is just beyond the SW tip.  This galaxy has an absorbtion lane (dust) along the north side, although this feature was not noted.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1956 = h2874 on 22 Jan 1836 and recorded "eF, S, R, gbM, 15"."  On a second sweep he noted "eF, little elongated, 40 arcseconds, has a coarse double star n.f., 6' distant."  His mean position (2 sweeps) is accurate.  DeLisle Stewart described this galaxy as a "vF, hazy * inv in nebula" (Harvard College Observatory correction list).

24" (12/28/16): at 225x; fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter, gradually increases to the center.  With direct vision a stellar nucleus pops out.  Situated 4.5' SSE of NGC 1954 in a trio (HDCE 361) with IC 2132.


17.5" (12/3/88): very faint, very small, round, weak concentration.  Located 5' SSE of NGC 1954.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 1957 = LM 1-149 on 11 Dec 1885 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is a good match with PGC 17427.  RNGC classifies it as an unverified southern object.

25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 397x; this LMC cluster was very bright, moderately large, round, 1' diameter.  A few extremely faint stars were resolved at the edge with a non-stellar knot or small clump of stars at the west end.  A mag 12 star is 1' NW.  Seven clusters lies within 7' of NGC 1958 including NGC 1969, 1971 and 1972, a close trio ~6' E and faint NGC 1950 and 1959, situated 6.5' SW and 5.5' S, respectively.


S-L 460, located 3.5' N, appeared fairly faint, round, 30" diameter, even surface brightness.

S-L 469, located 5.5' NNE, appeared fairly faint, irregular, 30" diameter.  Slightly brighter of a pair with S-L 460 3' SW.


24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this LMC cluster appeared bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter.  Increasing the magnification to 346x, the cluster resolved into a couple of dozen very faint, densely packed stars.  The 1' halo appeared irregular and mottled as if more stars were just below resolution.


This cluster is situated in a rich section of the central bar and a number of clusters are nearby. NGC 1958 forms the northern vertex of an isosceles triangle with NGC 1959 5.5' S and NGC 1950 6.3' SW.  A single brighter mag 11 star sits within this triangle at the vertex of another isosceles triangle with NGC 1959 and NGC 1950.  A trio of clusters, NGC 1969, 1971 and 1972, lies 5' to 6' E.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1958 = h2864 on 23 Dec 1834 and commented "The second of the group, fig 7, Pl IV. L; F; vgbM."  On a second observation he noted "F; R; gbM, 40".


Joseph Turner sketched the field containing NGC 1958 on 21 Dec 1875 with the Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 29).  His sketch clearly shows S-L 460 and 469, though Turner misidentified these two clusters as previous discoveries by Herschel.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this globular is at the southeast corner of a triangle of clusters with NGC 1958 5.5' NNW and NGC 1950 6' WNW.  It appears similar to NGC 1950 -- a moderately bright, fairly large glow of ~2' but with a relatively low surface brightness.  Appears slightly smaller than NGC 1958.  At 346x, a few faint stars are resolved around the edges. Located along the southeast side of the LMC bar, so the background is bright.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1959 = h2865 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "F; vL; vgbM; the third of several whose borders join, forming the group in figure 7, pl IV."  His position is fairly accurate.

18" (1/17/09): at 175x roughly 175 stars are resolved in the central 10' but irregular extensions increase the halo to closer to 20' and includes roughly 250 stars.  Many of the stars are arranged in long curving strings as well as one very distinctive curving loop on the SE side of the core with a pretty double (?737 = 8.5/9.0 at 11") with a fainter third companion at the NW end of the loop.  The cluster itself is pretty symmetrical with a dense 10' core and the brighter stars are sprinkled about fairly uniformly.


8": very bright, large, loose, includes two curving star lanes.  The double star ?737 = 8.5/9.0 at 11" is near the center.


Naked-eye (10/24/11): just glimpsed in very dark skies.


Giovanni Hodierna probably discovered M36 = NGC 1960 = h358 in 1654.  Guillaume Le Gentil rediscovered the cluster in 1749 and he is credited with the discovery in the NGC.  William Herschel, using his 7-ft reflector (6.2" aperture) at 120x on 28 Oct 1794, called it "a pretty rich cluster of small [faint] stars, seems to have many more than are visible, very small [faint]."

48" (10/23/11): at 375x, this distorted spiral appeared very bright, very large oval nearly 2:1 E-W, ~3.6'x2.0', highly asymmetric appearance.  Contains a very bright, large oval core that is clearly offset to the north side of the galaxy!  A large arm sweeps E-W along the south side of the halo.  A broad dust lane runs parallel to the arm on the inside.  Surrounding the core are shorter inner spiral arms including an arm just north of the core that sweeps west and bends south.  A mag 13.5 star is superimposed just inside the dust lane, 30" SSE of center.


24" (2/18/20): at 375x; fairly bright, very large, elongated 5:3 ~E-W, contains a bright elongated nucleus that is oddly offset towards the north side.  The halo has a low, but uneven surface brightness (due to spiral arms and dust) and extends nearly 3.5'x2.0', though it fades imperceptibly into the sky.  A mag 13.5 star is superimposed 30" SSE of center.  CGCG 329-011, located 8' NE, appeared very faint, small, round, 20" diameter, low surface brightness.  A mag 15.3 star is 20" S.


17.5" (12/8/90): moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, weak concentration, small bright core.  A mag 13 star is 30" SSE of center and a mag 12 star is just off the west edge, 2.4' from center.  There appears to be a dark patch between this star and the core.  Forms a pair with CGCG 329-011 7.6' NE (not seen).


8" (10/13/81): faint, moderately large, bright core, diffuse, elongated, star involved.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1961 = H III-747 on 3 Dec 1788 (sweep 889) and recorded "cF, pL, iF, mbM, easily resolvable, 5 or 6 of the stars belonging to it visible in the middle."


Bigourdan found this galaxy independently on 22 Dec 1891, measured an accurate position, and Dreyer catalogued Big. 385 as IC 2133.  In Dreyer's 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" he comments, "Caroline Herschel has used the place of the comparison star in Wollaston's Catalogue of 1790, which is very erroneous.  Auwers assumed it to be B.A.C. 1985, hence his very erroneous polar distance.  But it is = G. 1199 agreeing with two other stars, 42 and 43 Camelop.  The place of the neb found from this coincides with that of I.C. 2133 = Bigourdan 385."    So, NGC 1961 = IC 2133.  See Corwin's notes.

05 26 18 -68 50 18; Dor

V = 11.5


24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 1962 forms the bright western patch of the NGC 1962-65-66-70 cluster and emission nebula (stellar association LH 58).  At 200x it appeared as a large, fairly bright glow on the west side of the complex, ~2' in diameter.  A few faint stars are peppered across the glow.  At the E end is mag 12.3 HD 36521 = Brey 32, a WC4-type Wolf-Rayet binary.


Adding a UHC filter provided an excellent contrast gain to the bright nebulosity.  The entire complex is part of a Superbubble. NGC 1953, an LMC open cluster, lies 4.5' W and a large number of additional clusters that I didn't have time to explore lie to the south and southeast.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1962 = h2866 on 31 Jan 1835 and recorded "vF, pL, R; the first of a group of 4 nebulae [NGC 1962, 1965, 1966, 1970] with stars. (N.B. The mirror newly polished. See fig 20, Plate VI.)"  His sketch (Plate VI, figure 20) clearly identifies all 4 nebulae in the group.  James Dunlop discovered the entire group (D 136 = S-L 476) and described "a faint confused pretty large nebula.  There are a multitude of small nebulae in this place."  His position is ~10' too far SW (typical error), though he did not distinguish individual components.


Joseph Turner sketched the entire group in Dec 1875 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III, figure 30 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_30.php).  The sketch shows NGC 1962 as two connected pieces with a few stars involved.  Pietro Baracchi also sketched a patch directly between NGC 1962 and 1965 on 18 Nov 1884.

17.5" (2/22/03): at 100x, a distinctive looping group of two dozen mag 10-13 stars which is likely an asterism.  Roughly 10' diameter with a string of stars on the south side trailing to the east (forming the bottom loop of the figure "3").  Includes several mag 10-11 stars with two mag 8 stars (oriented N-S) on the north side of the low power field.  IC 2135, an edge-on galaxy, lies 15' E.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1963 = h2861 on 24 Dec 1835 and described "the cusp of a cluster of stars, 8...11m; arranged pretty exactly in a figure of 3 with appendages.  *8 in cusp taken."  This group of stars stands out fairly well on the DSS although the brightest star is closer to mag 10.  This is a random grouping with no correlation in proper motion.  The RC3 and PGC misidentify the galaxy IC 2135 (~15' further east) as NGC 1963.  RNGC classifies NGC 1963 as nonexistent.

William Herschel discovered NGC 1964 = H IV-21 = h2860 on 20 Nov 1784 (sweep 325) and recorded "vS, stellar, the nucleus very brigh; the chevelure vF and not perfectly central; there seems to be a vS star preceding it."  His RA is 13 sec too large, but the identification is certain.  John Herschel observed this galaxy from the Cape of Good Hope and recorded "F, irregularly round, vsbM, to a star 12th mag, 2 or 3 stars involved, and several bright ones near."

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a bright, small knot on the NW side of a large HII complex and cluster (association LH 58) that includes NGC 1966 (1.5' ESE), NGC 1962 (2.2' SW) and NGC 1970.  NGC 1965 surrounds two stars and ~20" in diameter with a fainter nebulous halo.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1965 = h2867 = D 136? on 31 Jan 1835 and recorded "F, S; the second of a group of four nebulae [with NGC 1962, 1966 and 1970] with stars. The place interpolated from those of the 1st and 3rd by aid of a diagram made at the time.  Plate VI, figure 20."


Herschel noted Dunlop 136, discovered on 25 Sep 1826 probably includes h2867.  James Dunlop wrote, "a faint confused pretty large nebula.  There are a multitude of small nebulae in this place."  Dunlop's position is ~10' too far SW (typical error), though he did not distinguish the individual components of the complex, at least in his published description.  The entire group was also sketched by Joseph Turner in Dec 1875 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III.30 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_30.php)

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this number refers to one of the multiple components of a large star cloud and HII complex (LH 58), ~5' in diameter.  At 346x this is a small, bright glow on the NE side that surrounds three stars, elongated WNW-ESE, ~40"x15".  Fainter nebulosity is attached extending to the west for 1.5' and connecting to the knot NGC 1965.  A mag 9.9 star lies 1.2' S.  This HII complex is located roughly 12' S of a mag 6.1 star (6.7/7.0 pair at a close 1.4").


At 200x using a UHC filter, this is a fascinating emission complex as the entire 5' region is awash in bright nebulosity and there are faint, irregular extensions beyond the main portion, particularly to the north (the outer portions form a faint bubble on images).  A 10th mag star is involved, though the cluster itself (S-L 476) does not stand out significantly.


NGC 1966 is sometimes applied to the entire complex. Shapley listed the complex as the center of the OB-association "Constellation" II (of V).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1966 = h2868 on 31 Jan 1835 and recorded "the third of a group of four nebulae with stars; pB, R, pslbM.  Plate VI, figure 20."  Herschel notes this might be Dunlop 77 (two question marks), but this must be an error as the position of D 77 is roughly 04 56 07 -70 07 (2000).  Dunlop discovered the entire group (D 136 = S-L 476) and described "a faint confused pretty large nebula.  There are a multitude of small nebulae in this place."

First of 3 clusters with NGC 1984 5.4' ESE and NGC 1994 9' ESE.  BSDL 1781 is a 1.5'x0.5' elongated group of stars just 2.5' NE.  About 10 stars mag 13-14.5 in a N-S string were resolved.  NGC 1967 is situated 9' SW of the NGC 1983 star cloud/association (LH 61).


John Herschel discovered NGC 1967 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and listed it as object #456 in his table of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  His position is 1.8' too far northwest.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): NGC 1968 is the third in a great chain of clusters involved in extensive nebulosity oriented southwest to northeast. The cluster is bright and very elongated 3'x1' E-W with ~20 stars including a number of mag 12-13 stars.  The cluster (part of association LH 60) is surrounded by nebulosity (Henize N51C) that brightens on the east end in a large, round knot and extends beyond the cluster on the south side for several arc minutes in the direction of NGC 1955 to the WSW.  NGC 1968 is connected to NGC 1974, another nebulous cluster 3' NE and NGC 1955 lies 8' WSW.  The entire complex is nicknamed the LMC "Sextant Arc".


John Herschel discovered NGC 1968 = h2870 on 2 Jan 1837 and described "The third of a great line of rich clusters [with NGC 1955, 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1974] all connected by abundance of irregularly scattered stars."  His position is 1' too far west.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a compact right triangle of clusters with NGC 1971 1.2' SE and NGC 1972 1.4' E (within stellar association LH 59).  At 260x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round.  This cluster has a lower surface brightness than NGC 1971 and 1972.  A mag 13 star is at the NW edge.  NGC 1958 lies 5' W.  Located along the southeast side of the LMC bar, with a relatively bright background glow


John Herschel discovered NGC 1969 = h2872 in Dec 1834 and recorded on NGC 1969 "the 4th of several running together (fig 7, Pl IV). F; S; attached to a larger (the 5th)."  The 5th refers to NGC 1971 = h2875.  His position is accurate.  James Dunlop possibly discovered this cluster earlier on 24 Sep 1826 and noted (D 93) "a very faint nebula, about 30" diameter."  His position is ~5' SE of the NGC 1969/1971/1972 trio, but visually NGC 1971 is the most prominent of the group.  So, my guess is that D 93 refers to NGC 1971.

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x; NGC 1970 is at the SE corner of the NGC 1962-65-66-70 complex (stellar association LH 58).  It consists of three close collinear stars oriented NNW-SSE with the brightest mag 10.8 star at the north end.  Using a UHC filter, the stars were surrounded by only very weak nebulosity that was no more prominent than the general field haze.  HD 269546 = Brey 34, a mag 9.9 Wolf-Rayet binary (WN5+B3) and the brightest individual star in the complex, is just 0.7' WNW of the 3 stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1970 = h2869 on 31 Jan 1835 and recorded "The last nebula in the group of four [with NGC 1962, 1965 and 1966] with stars. Place concluded (with no precision) from the 1st and 3rd by the aid of a diagram." [Plate VI, fig 20].  Despite his uncertainty with the position, it is pretty accurate. Dunlop discovered the entire group (D 136 = S-L 476) and described "a faint confused pretty large nebula.  There are a multitude of small nebulae in this place."  His position is ~10' too far SW (typical error), though he did not distinguish individual components.  Herschel noted the possible equivalence with D 136.


The complex was also sketched by Joseph Turner in Dec 1875 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope (plate III.30 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_3_30.php).  His sketch shows the three stars oriented NNW-SSE with no nebulosity, but there is a patch of nebulosity surrounded by a ring of stars that is sketched close north. Pietro Baracchi also took this group of four or five stars as GC 1175 = NGC 1970.

At 260x it appeared bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter (largest of trio), gradually increases to the center.  At 350x, it contains a sharp stellar core or a mag 14 star is superimposed and a star is also on the SE edge.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 1971 (or NGC 1972) = D 93 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a very faint nebula, about 30" diameter."  His position is ~5' SE of the trio NGC 1969/1971/1972.  Based on my visual observation I propose that NGC 1971 = D 93, although Steinicke assigns D 93 to NGC 1972.

At 260x this small cluster is bright, round, ~35" diameter (smaller than NGC 1971).  There is either a very small knot of stars at the east edge (DSS reveals an apparent close double star).  These clusters are buried with the southeast side of the LMC's bar, so the field has a bright background.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1972 (or NGC 1971) = D 93 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a very faint nebula, about 30" diameter."  His position is ~5' SE of the trio NGC 1969/1971/1972.  Based on my visual observation I suggest that NGC 1971 = D 93, although Steinicke assigns D 93 to NGC 1972.  JH independently discovered this cluster (h2876) on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded it as "the 6th of several [including NGC 1950, 1958, 1959, 1969 and 1971] running together (fig 7, Pl IV). This also is a double nebula, having a very small one attached N.p (No 7)."  His position is ~40" too far south.


Joseph Turner sketched the field (along with NGC 1958, 1969 and 1972) on 21 Dec 1875 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.  See plate III, figure 29 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/index.php#m_3_29

24" (1/22/15): locally bright (reflection?) nebula surrounding mag 6.9 HD 36958, embedded within the much larger NGC 1977 complex.  Extends ~4' diameter in a circular glow, though the perphery is not well defined.  A fainter star 34" NNE is involved in the nebula and at moments seemed to be encased in its own small halo.  NGC 1975 is 4.4' NE.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 1973 on 16 Dec 1862 within NGC 1977.  He calls it a nebulous mag 8-9 star and his single position corresponds with HD 36958 = SAO 132302 = KX Ori.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): NGC 1974 is the fourth in a great looping chain of clusters and nebulosity (collectively called the "Sextant Arc") including NGC 1955 and NGC 1968 to the SW.  NGC 1974 is virtually attached to NGC 1968, only distinguished by less nebulosity and stars.  Roughly three dozen stars were resolved in a 3' circular group (stellar association LH 63) including a number of mag 12-13 stars.  The cluster is involved in fairly bright nebulous haze (LMC-N51A).  A filament of nebulosity on the NE side is the brightest part of an incomplete superbubble.


Nail and Shapley designated the OB association that includes the "Sextant Arc" as "Constellation III" in a 1953 paper on the Magellanic Clouds.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 1974 = D 213 on 6 Nov 1826 and described "a faint elliptical nebula, about 30" diameter. This is the following in a curved line of nebulae." He observed it on three occasions and his position is 2.8' too far northeast.   John Herschel recorded h2877 on 23 Nov 1834 as "The following part of a large irregular cluster which extends obliquely across the field." The objects in this grouping include NGC 1955, 1968, 1974 and NGC 1991 and his position is accurate (~30" south of center).  JH found this nebulous cluster again on 2 Jan 1837 and recorded it as h2884 (= NGC 1991), although his RA was 1.0 min too large.  So, NGC 1974 = NGC 1991.  Lucke and Hodge misidentifies this object (typo) as NGC 1947.

48" (4/1/11): the Trapezium was first object viewed while the sky was still darkening.  The "H" star (discovered by Barnard in 1888 with the Lick 36" was easily visible without reference to a chart, though I apparently missed the G star inside the Trapezium and a fainter companion to H at 1.3" separation.  The "E" component was seen for the first time with a vivid orange color!  In addition, due north of the A-E pair is a faint double star near the edge of the darker central pocket containing the Trapezium.  On the opposite side (SE) of the Trapezium (at the edge of the inner pocket) are a wide pair of stars (~20") oriented E-W with possibly a third extremely difficult star between and a bit further east.  Although I didn't take notes or try to sketch the main features of M42, there were several faint pink or red stars peppered over the glow of the nebula!


17.5" (10/12/85): best emission nebula in northern sky, fantastic view under all conditions, bright colored wings sweep to the east and south.  The remarkable structure is difficult to describe but includes bays, filaments, knots, nebulous stars and a huge outer loop.  Definite colors are visible including pale greens and pinks.  Highlighted by the Trapezium which contains six stars and appears to reside in a darker hollow.  The bright portion surrounding Theta probably has the highest surface brightness of any HII region in the sky with an "electric" appearance.  Dark streaks and a dark wedge = "fish's mouth" intrudes on the NE side.  Using an H-Beta filter, the nebulosity significantly dims in general but there is one outer wing or loop on the west side (oriented N-S) which obviously increases in contrast with the filter!


The following observational history of M42 = NGC 1976 = h360 is largely from Wolfgang Steinicke and http://seds.org/messier/more/m042_dis.html


The Orion Nebula was probably discovered in November 1610 by Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580-1637), a French lawyer, who turned his telescope (given to him by Galileo) to Orion and reported a "small illuminated cloud" near the middle star of Orion's Sword. This sighting, however, was not published, but only reported in Peiresc's personal documents and mentioned by Bigourdan in 1916.  Jesuit astronomer Johann Baptist Cysat (1588-1657) of Lucerne was independently found it the following year.  In 1619 he compared it to a comet he had observed in 1618. Cysat's work also did not get widely circulated but was found and reported by Rudolf Wolf in 1854. So, Dreyer included Cysat under the "Other Observers" column in the NGC.  The first known (very rough) sketch of the Orion nebula was created by Sicilian astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included three stars, probably Theta1, Theta2A and Theta2B.  As he was little-known, his work was lost and not rediscovered until the 1980's.


None of the early discoveries were known when Christian Huygens rediscovered the nebula in 1656 with a 50mm refractor and published the first printed sketch which appeared in his "Systema Saturnium" in 1659, gaining credit for a long time as the discoverer, as reported by Halley and Messier. Huygens's sketch included 3 stars in the trapezium and the general shape of the bright central part of the nebula.  Messier's more detailed sketch [made in 1769] showing the wings and the "fish's mouth" near the trapezium was published in 1771 (M?moires de l'Acad?mie Royale), though soon after William Herschel trained his large mirrors towards M42 (first observations in March 1774) and obtained much more detailed views.  He called it "altogether the most wonderful object in the heavens." (16 Oct 1784)


M42 was one of the objects Lord Rosse attempted to "resolve" in 1845 and 1846 using his new 72-inch.  After several bouts of poor weather, in February of 1846 he wrote "we are still in doubt as to the resolvability of the Nebula in Orion.  The great instrument has shown us an immense number of stars in it, dense groups in the immediate vicinity of the Trapezium, but further evidence is I think wanting."  A month later he was more convinced, writing in a letter "...there can be little if any doubt as to the resolvability of the nebulae...we could plainly see that all about the trapezium is a mass of stars; the rest of the nebula also abounding with stars, and exhibiting the characteristics of resolvability strongly marked."  Most astronomers accepted these claims, though a few such as Wilhelm Struve challenged the alleged resolution.  Clearly the Orion was a poor choice to decide resolvability as there are many stars associated with it, but the Irish observers also claimed resolvability for the Crab Nebula and the Ring Nebula (especially by Romney Robinson). George Bond, son of William Cranch Bond and Director of the Harvard College Observatory, claimed to have confirmed Rosse's resolution using HCO's new 15" refractor.  In his first examination on 21-22 Sep 1847, he scrawled in his notebook, "Resolved. Mottled. Abundance of Stars."  He reported to Harvard's president that "You will rejoice with me that the great Nebula in Orion has yielded to the powers of our incomparable telescope!"


Ronald Stoyan, in "Sketching the Orion Nebula" (Astronomy, Feb 2013), stated that Bond determined the positions of all stars he could perceive through the 15-inch (HCO refractor) in a 20' radius around the Trapezium.  Working through seven winter seasons from 1857 to 1864 and finally reaching a field of 3.36? square, he catalogued 1,101 stars as faint as 15th magnitude, observed numerous various stars, and described M42 in metriculous detail like no one before.  But above all, he sketched what he saw at the eyepiece - the first complete and accurate "image" of this region.  His eye for detail was so that that the engraver [for the 1867 "Observations upon the Great Nebula in Orion" in http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1867AnHar...5D...3B] had to look through the telescope to adequately reproduce Bond's impressions.  The result was the most accurate and elaborate astronomical drawing ever done.  Bond's cousin, American astronomer Edward S. Holden, said in 1882 that it was the "most satisfactory representation of any celestial object."  [A biography of George Bond, as well as his sketch of the Orion Nebula is at http://ejamison.net/bond.html]


The Orion Nebula was reported early on by various observers as possibly variable, with changes in both shape and brightness.  Edward Holden gives a comprehensive history of observations of the Orion Nebula by 44 individuals, from Cysat in 1619 to Draper in 1880.  See http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7237514M/.  Henry Draper took the first photograph of the Orion Nebula on 30 Sep 1880 with an 11-inch Clark refractor, though the resolution and details were very poor.  In 1882-83, Ainslee Common obtained a number of impressive long-exposure photographs using his 36-inch silver-on-glass reflector (first to show details not visible naked-eye) and in 1889 Isaac Roberts produced some excellent wide-field photographs of M42 using a 20-inch Grubb reflector.

24" (1/22/15): NGC 1977 is a prominent 20' field of nebulosity involving 42 Ori (V = 4.6 and a challenging 1.2" pair), 45 Ori (V = 5.2) and mag 7.3 HD 37058 on the south side and NGC 1973 (KX Ori) and NGC 1975 (?746) in the northern half.  The entire complex is irregularly luminous but locally brightest around these stars and dimmer in the central region.  The southern portion is brighter and elongated E-W with an irregular outline.  On the southeast side is an extension and the northeast section ends near a 30" unequal pair of stars.  See NGC 1973 and NGC 1975 for separate descriptions.


13.1": extensive bright field of nebulosity including NGC 1973 and NGC 1975, very large, elongated ~E-W.  Involves several bright stars including 42 Orionis (V = 4.7) and 45 Orionis (V = 5.3).  Irregular and detailed with detached segments.  Extends north and south beyond 42 Orionis.  Located north of M42 and south of the bright cluster NGC 1981.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1977 = H V-30 on 18 Jan 1786 (sweep 510) and recorded "I returned to the c's Orionis [1 and 2 c Orionis], and the stars about them; and found them as suspected involved in very visible, and unequally bright milky nebulosity.  I am pretty sure this joins to the great nebula [M42]."  NGC 1977 is generally taken as the brightest portion around 42 and 45 Orionis, though Herschel's description really applies to the entire nebula and scattered group of stars.

Only a few mag 15-16 stars were resolved around the edges at 303x.  NGC 1978 is situated within the huge LMC-4 Superbubble that includes the NGC 1848 complex 18' WSW, NGC 2003 19' SE and the "Eighth-Note Nebula" (LHa 120-N55) 25' SE.

James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 1978 = D 238 = h2878 on 6 Nov 1826 and described "a faint round nebula, about 50" diameter.  His position is 05 27 37, -66 21 (2000), about 10' SW of the globular.


JH first observed this bright globular on 2 Nov 1834, logging "vB, vL, E, gbM, 3'." On his final of 3 sweeps, he recorded "vB, vL; oval; vgpmbM; a beautiful nebula; it has very much resemblance to the Nubecula Major itself as seen with the naked eye, but is far brighter and more impressive in its general aspect as if the Nubecula were at least doubled in intensity. (Note - July 29, 1837. I well remember this observation, it was the result of repeated comparisons between the object seen in the telescope and the actual nubecula as seen high in the sky on the meridian, and no vague estimate carelessly set down. And who can say whether in this object, magnified and analysed by telescopes infinitely superior to what we now possess, there may not exist all the complexity of detail that the nubecula itself presents to our examination!)"

13.1" (1/28/84): very faint, large nebulosity of low surface brightness surrounding Iota Orionis (V = 2.8).  Very difficult to distinguish from glare of Iota.  M42 lies 30' N.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1980 = H V-31 = h361 on 31 Jan 1786 (sweep 517) and noted "Iota Orionis seems with its neighbouring stars to be involved in milky nebulosity; but it is so faint and the number of stars makes the field so bright, that I cannot assure myself; though I compared this spot with the preceding and following ones."  He observed it again on sweep 529 and recorded "Iota certainly affected, but no more that what the tinge of the bottom in this neighbourhood will account for."  John Herschel noted on 8 Jan 1831 (sweep 218), "Iota Orionis involved in a feeble neb 3' diam."


Iota Orionis was first observed with Lord Rosse's 72" on 28 Jan 1849.  Either Lord Rosse or assistant Johnstone Stoney recorded, "Dark space in the nebula containing nearest companion; light nearly equable; sketch made (by Stoney); 3-feet telescope employed.  All the stars in the neighbourhood are nebulous, of these two a little sp, last seem to have dar spaces as in figure."


William Lassell made an observation on 7 Jan 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector and reported, "Surveyed this star for some time without any impression of a nebula about it.  At length I began to conceive that the glare around it, which I had attributed to the splendour of the star, might be really nebulous; and on further looking attentively at the stars, I could fancy they were on a black ground in the midst of the nebulae; but, without the suggestion of Lord Rosse's drawing, I think the appearance would have escaped me."  Observing with the 48" Melbourne telescope on 3 Jan 1886, Pietro Baracchi commented, "Uncertain - Is it nebulosity or stray diffused light from the stars?"


It is very possible that WH observed just scattered light around Iota, since the very southern end of M42 has a very low surface brightness and would be difficult to distinguish among the several bright stars in the field.  Wolfgang Steinicke favors interpreting NGC 1980 as an illusion (personal email on 21 Mar 2015), though Harold Corwin is not convinced (personal email of 23 Mar 2015).

It appeared as a very bright, small knot of stars, 30" diameter, with a half-dozen resolved.  The star cloud is elongated N-S and is rich in bright and faint stars (too many to count).  A very striking N-S string (6' length) of 10 bright mag 10.5-12 stars passes just east of the cluster.  Just outside the field to the south (9' from S-L 492) is NGC 1984, along with NGCs 1994 and 1967.


Two additional clusters were picked up nearby to the east (nearly collinear with S-L 492).  H-S 314, 3.7' E of S-L 492, appeared as a bright, high surface brightness, compact glow, 20" diameter, no resolution.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1983 = h2881 on 11 Nov 1836 and described "a pretty rich irregular cluster which fills the field; a knot in it taken."  S-L 492 is the "knot" he measured, but the object which "fills the field" is the association LH 61.

H-S 307, a very faint cluster, lies 4.8' NNE (logged as "small, round and grainy, ~25" diameter") and a very small trio of clusters, NGC 1969, 1971 and 1972 is ~9' NW.  NGC 1959 is a bit further away at 11' WNW with NGC 1950 continuing on the same line 16.5' WNW.  All of these clusters are visible in the same 30' field of the 13mm Ethos at 200x.  In addition, a number of clusters, including H-S 327, S-L 519, S-L 535 and NGC 2016 are nearly on a line extending to the east!


John Herschel discovered NGC 1986 = h2883 on 24 Nov 1834 and recorded "pF; pL; R; glbM; 2'."  His position (measured on 4 sweeps) is accurate.  James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 1986 = D 94? earlier on 27 Sep 1826 and simply logged "an extremely faint small nebula."  His position is 7' due south of the cluster.   Another possibility is D 96, recorded on 24 Sep 1826, refers to this cluster.  He reported "a faint round nebula nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, slightly bright to the centre."  Dunlop's position here is further off - 12.6' ESE - but is the entry Glen Cozens identifies as NGC 1986.

NGC 1988 = Chacornac's Variable Nebula

05 37 26.5 +21 13 06; Tau


= *, Carlson.  =**, Gottlieb.


The following historical summary is based on Wolfgang Steinicke's "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters" as well as Harold Corwin's NGC/IC identification notes.  Jean Chacornac discovered NGC 1988 on 19 Oct 1855 with the 25-cm Lerebours refractor of the Paris Observatory, though the note "have found a new nebula very near to Zeta Tauri." was not announced until 1863. When he reobserved the field on 20 Nov 1862, he was surprised to find the "nebula" missing and Heinrich d'Arrest was unsuccessful in seeing it in 1863 and 1865.  Tempel reported it was probably a reflection in the eyepiece (and not a variable nebula) based on his negative sighting in 1861.  Hind later summarized the discovery and subsequent negative results of this object in a paper titled "Chacornac's Variable Nebula near Zeta Tauri" in 1876.  John Herschel, unaware of Tempel's negative result, catalogued it as GC 1911 and Dreyer followed in the NGC with the description "!!!, variable (?)", though he has a long description on this star in the notes section in which he mentions that Tempel found only a false image of a star.  Still others tried to find it including Father Hagen who described this object as a ghost image of mag 3 Zeta Tauri.  Burnham also unsuccessfully searched for it in 1891 with the 36-inch Lick refractor (Publ of Lick Observatory, II).  Burnham agreed with Tempel's assessment and added "Too much time has been wasted in looking for this object.."   Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, concluded "*12.5 in Dreyer's place, BD +21 907 f 0.6'."  Harold Corwin also suggests this was a "reflection or flare from zeta Tauri which is only 5 arcmin to the southeast."  This is the only NGC entry credited to Chacornac, so he didn't discover any non-stellar objects.

John Herschel discovered NGC 1989 = h2871 on 28 Jan 1835 and recorded "eeF; S; R; south of several bright stars."  On a second sweep he noted "vF; S; R at the apex of a converging parcel of distant stars."  His position (measured on 3 sweeps) is accurate.

= * (Epsilon Orionis = middle belt star).  Nebulosity not visible on the POSS-II.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1990 = H V-34 = h363 on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518) and reported "Epison Orionis passed, and I am pretty sure it is involved in nebulosity, unequally diffused."  John Herschel made two observations at Slough and remarked (sweep 107, 23 Nov 1827) "Epsilon Orionis.  Place by Catalogue a very brilliant star involved in an immense nebulous atmosphere, whose north and south limits are 91? 7' 29" and 91? 31' 29".  Viewed also and shown to Mr. Dunlop in Sweep 110."  Guillaume Bigourdan reported "I could not see any trace of nebulosity around this bright star which is epsilon Orion. Nor did d'Arrest or Engelhardt see any nebulosity around this star."  The Birr Castle observers reported no nebulosity on several attempts.  But on 3 Jan 1886, Pietro Baracchi observed Epsilon Ori with the 48" Melbourne telescope and comments "There is no doubt it is a whitish atmosphere surrounding Epsilon Orionis fading gradually away that the boundaries cannot be ascertained..."


In 1893 Lewis Swift wrote, "Sir William Herschel supposed he had discovered a very large, very faint nebula surrounding Epsilon Orionis.  For this I have sought many times with both telescopes, but always in vain, having never been able to detect anything more than the faint glow which surrounds every bright star."


Based on Crossley plates at Lick, Curtis reported in 1913, "It seems that Herschel must have been misled here by the radiance about the very bright star... I find no trace of nebulosity in an exposure of two hours."  Dorothy Carlson classified this number as nonexistent in her 1940 paper on NGC/IC corrections based on Curtis' results.  Brian Skiff, also found no large nebulosity surrounding Epsilon Orionis and Harold Corwin concludes this object is nonexistent.  He notes, though, that images are too burned in, to tell if there is a small, faint nebulosity very close to Epsilon (like IC 349 adjacent to Merope).

See observing notes for NGC 1974 with the 30" from Coonabarabran.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1991 = h2884 on 2 Jan 1837 and noted "the 4th of a great line of rich clusters connected by abundant irregularly scattered stars."  There is nothing at his position, but 1.0 min of RA west (same declination) is NGC 1974 and the Hodge-Wright Atlas (1967) notes "probably NGC 1974.  RA off by 1m."  ESO repeats the identification NGC 1974 = NGC 1991.


Eric Lindsay, in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" [1964IrAJ....6..286L], notes "Not found. This should be 1m due east of NGC 1974 which follows NGC 1955, 1968."  RNGC follows Lindsay and classifies NGC 1991 nonexistent instead of equating with NGC 1974.

30" (10/12/15 - OzSky): extremely bright, fairly small, high surface brightness knot, 25" diameter, clumpy, irregular.  The main patch is too dense to cleanly resolve (a few stars sparkle over the background glow) but a large number of mag 13-15 stars are nearby, forming a larger cluster.  Mag 11.5 stars are less than 1' NE and 1.5' ESE.  Forms a striking pair with NGC 1984 3.8' W with NGC 1967 9' WNW.  In a gorgeous, rich region of the LMC with scattered brighter stars extending 10' N to NGC 1983.


25" (10/10/15 - OzSky): at 318x; very bright, small, very high surface brightness knot, 25" diameter, slightly elongated E-W.  A few stars are resolved in the cluster and many are scattered very nearby.  In a very rich region of the LMC and third of three clusters with NGC 1984 and 1967.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1994 = h2887 on 16 Dec 1835 and described "a little knot, a triple, perhaps a quadruple star, forming a point of reference in a cluster of the 7th class. The knot looks like a nebula till analysed."  On a second sweep he logged "the second knot in a rich cluster of irregular figure of stars 11..16th mag. The knot seems to be a close double or triple star."  His position is accurate.

14" (4/7/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 230x): NGC 1995 is a 13" pair of mag 15/15.5 stars just 2.3' NW of NGC 1995.  Through thin clouds, low elevation and only fair seeing, it appeared as a very faint unresolved glow.  Under these conditions, I would also have mistaken it for a tiny nebula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1995 = h2879, along with NGC 1998 = h2880, on 28 Dec 1834 and recorded "eeF; R; bM; exceedingly difficult and delicate. (Sky perfectly clear.) The preceding of two [with NGC 1998].  Both objects were recorded on sweep 526, while NGC 1998 was also recorded on sweep 762. NGC 1995 appears to apply to a faint pair of stars at ~13" separation and Corwin also concludes NGC 1995 is a double star.  The photographic description in the RNGC under NGC 1995 applies to NGC 1998 (descriptions are reversed).


Pietro Baracchi observed NGC 1995 with the 48" Melbourne telescope on 15 Feb 1888 and noted "vF; vvS; stellar - easily mistaken for a very minute star."  Actually he was mistaken!

18" (11/6/04): at 73x (31 Nagler), this is a moderately rich group of ~60 stars mag 11-14 in a large, elongated group, perhaps 17'x8', extended N-S.  The majority of the stars are ~12th magnitude.  A string of 10th magnitude stars heads southeast for 15'.  Situated in a rich star field ~20' W of mag 5.2 HD 37438 (125 Tauri).  This cloud stands out reasonably well at low power but would not be distinguishable at higher power.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1996 = H VIII-42 on 7 Dec 1785 (sweep 485) and described a "cluster of coarsely scattered stars above 15' dia.  The stars nearly of a size and equally scatterered."  On 26 Oct 1786 (sweep 627) he noted "a coarsely scattered clu of pL stars, not rich; may be a projecting point of the milky way." Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, describes this group as 17'x12' in PA 10, "Cl, L, E, pP, sc, st 11..."  The DSS appearance agrees with this description and the group (status as a cluster is uncertain) is between two mag 5-6 stars at 40' separation E-W.  The RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (Type 7).

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 303x; fairly faint elongated glow, oriented SW-NE, ~45"x30".  A mag 14 star is attached at the northeast end and a couple of additional mag 16 stars are on the NW and SW sides.  Located 47' SSW of mag 3.8 Beta Dor, well to the north of the main body of the LMC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1997 = h2886 on 30 Nov 1834 and described as "eF; R; 30"."  His position from this single sweep is ~30" SE of the center of the cluster.  Robert Innes observed the cluster in 1926 with the 26.5-inch refractor at the Union Observatory.  He reported it as "Nebula, 12 mag, touching an 11 mag star on Sp, 20" diameter, looks lie the tail of a comet, star being the head."  The direction of the star is at the NE edge of the cluster.

NGC 1995, a close pair of very faint stars, is 2.3' NW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 1998 = h2880 on 28 Dec 1834 and recorded "eeF, R, bM, the following of two [with NGC 1995 = h2879]; in field to the south is a brilliant group of stars."  His position matches ESO 204-015 = PGC 17434, though NGC 1995 applies to a double star.  RNGC misclassifies NGC 1998 as nonexistent (Type 7), though the photographic description for NGC 1998 is given under the listing for NGC 1995.  Megastar mislabels this galaxy as NGC 1995.

NGC 1999 = LBN 979 = Ced 55i = PP 34

05 36 25.3 -06 42 57; Ori

Size 2'x2'


48" (10/25/11): stunning view at 375x and 488x.  The high surface brightness reflection nebulosity surrounding the mag 10.5-11.0 illuminating star (V380 Ori) was intensely bright.  The dark splotch (possibly a Bok globule) that blots out a portion of the nebula just west of center appeared sharply etched into the nebulosity and formed a "keyhole" or "anvil" outline with a thin extension to the east and a thicker north-south flat section on the west.  The contrast of this dark nebulosity was extremely high and appeared virtually identical to images.


18" (2/24/06): spectacular view at 565x.  The bright mag 10.5 central star appears slightly offset east of center, though this may be an optical affect due to the very dark patch on the west side.  The bright, 2' reflection nebula is slightly brighter just following the central star.  The irregular dark vacuity is large and detailed at this power and appears anvil-shaped.  The base of the anvil is along the western side and oriented N-S.  There is a narrow extension to the south that tapers to a wedge.  Along the north side, the globule extends to the east and partially wraps around the central star.  This was the first time I've seen the dark patch take on an appearance similar to the well-known HST image.


17.5" (2/22/03): remarkable, bright 2' reflection nebula surrounding mag 10.5 V380 Orionis (emission-line star).  At 220x, a prominent, curving dark patch or globule wraps around the star along the west side.  Two of the brightest Herbig-Haro objects are close south, with HH 2 lies 4.3' due south and fainter HH 1 2.5' is SSW.


17.5" (2/8/90): bright, high surface brightness emission nebula surrounding a mag 10 star, round, about 2' diameter.  There is a striking curved irregular dark patch or globule along the west side of the central star that is remarkable at high power.  The nebulosity is weakest on the SE side of star.  Easily takes 220x-280x.


17.5" (2/22/86): bright, round nebula around a 10th magnitude illuminating star.  A eye-catching, curved, irregular dark patch is NW of the central star within the nebulosity.


13.1" (2/25/84): a curving dark lane is visible west of the central star with faint nebulosity west of the gap.


8" (11/28/81): small circular nebulosity surrounds a mag 10 star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 1999 = H IV-33 on 5 Oct 1785 (sweep 458) and called it "a star with a very strong burr all around."  On 1 Nov 1785 (sweep 468) he noted "vB or rather a nucleus with a milky nebulosity chiefly on the preceding side, of no very great extent."  In his 1814 PT paper WH included NGC 1999 under the section "Of Stars connected with extensive windings of nebulosity" and noted "a star situated upon a ground of extremely faint "milky nebulosity diffused over this part of the heavens, has "a milky chevelure surrounding it, which is brighter than "the nebulosity of the ground; but which loses itself imperceptibly in the extreme faintness of the general diffusion of the nebulous matter."  He used this object in his argument that the star was formed by the law of gravitation from the nebular material.  His rough sketch shows the off-central star superimposed, though no dark patch.  Ralph Copeland, observing with Lord Rosse's 72" on 15 Nov 1873, recorded a "*9m with nebulosity in which there is a vacuity preceding the star.  It looks like a comet coiled round into a ring nebula [See Pl I.].  So, clearly the dark patch was quite evident.


Based on photographs taken at the Helwan Observatory in Egypt between 1914-16 with the 30" Reynolds reflector, NGC 1999 was described as "!! vB, pL, a dense globe with an absolutely dark triangular hole cutting into it."  Although the dark patch is generally assumed to be a dark globule, a 2010 paper "er ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel. The NGC 1999 dark globule is not a globule" (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1005.2202S), suggests that "the dark patch is in fact a hole or cavity in the material producing the NGC 1999 reflection nebula, excavated by protostellar jets from the V 380 Ori multiple system."  See http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEAKPO8G_index_0.html for more.
