At 610x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 0.7'x0.3', even surface brightness except for a very small brighter nucleus.  This galaxy has a redshift of z = .038, which is 6.5x greater than NGC 450, so UGC 807 forms a line-of-sight pair.

48" (11/1/13): moderately bright and large, elongated ~5:2 WNW-ESE, ~0.6'x0.25', contains a small brighter core.  At 610x and 697x, the galaxy appears asymmetric, with the arm on the WNW side dimming to a low surface brightness but extending noticeably further than the ESE arm and increasing the major axis to 0.8' or 0.9'.  A mag 16 star is superimposed near the ESE end.  First in an interacting "Taffy" pair with UGC 816 0.9' NE.

 

24" (8/30/16): at 375x; faint to fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated ~3:1 WNW-ESE, 0.55'x0.2'. A mag 16 star is superimposed at the ESE end.  Forms the western component of the "Taffy 2" galaxies with UGC 816 45" NE.

 

24" (10/13/12): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, 0.5'x0.2', brighter nucleus.  This galaxy is the western member of an interacting "Taffy" pair with UGC 816 just 50" NE.  Slightly fainter CGCG 551-011 (non-interacting) lies 2.2' WSW forming the triple group KTG 4.

 

Like the original "Taffy" galaxies UGC 12914/5, these post-collisional spiral galaxies are joined by a synchrotron radio bridge whose brightness contours resemble stretched bands of taffy.  Most of the system's H I was stripped by the collision ~50,000,000 years ago and now lies in the bridge.

In 2016 it was announced UGC 1382, which was believed to be a passive elliptical galaxy, is actually a giant low surface brightness galaxy (GLSB) which rivals the archetypical GLSB Malin 1 in size. It has two components: a high surface brightness disk galaxy surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) disk. The main body of the galaxy is embedded in a massive low-density HI disk with a radius of 110 kpc, making this one of the largest isolated disk galaxies known.

24" (12/28/16): at 432x; fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 25"x20".  Two 13th magnitude stars are 50" NW and 1.0' W and a mag 14.5 star is 1.0' ESE.  IC 1781 is 16' SE.

 

In the 1980s, prominent broad lines appeared in the optical spectrum of a black-hole system called Mrk 1018. The leading explanation for this change is that the accretion rate onto the black hole increased, energizing more of the gas and expanding the size of the broad-line region. But in 2016 it was found that in the past five years, Mrk 1018 has returned to its original state. This transition is thought to be due to a decrease in the black-hole accretion rate.

48" (10/29/16): at 488x; the unusual spiral structure in UGC 1810 = Hubble's "Rose" was easily visible.  A long thin tidal arm can be traced attached to the north side of the bright core.  It unfurls sharply counterclockwise to the east and passes through a mag 14 star.  The arm shoots due south of this star on the east end of the galaxy and continues to curl southwest.  It terminates due south (or a bit west) of the core, ~1' from center.  A second low surface brightness arm is attached on the south side of the core and swings to the west, south of a superimposed mag 13.5 star.  STF 251, an excellent 9.0/9.6 pair at 2.1" is 2.9' E.  Forms a striking interacting pair (Arp 273 = VV 323) with UGC 1813 1.3' SE.

 

48" (2/18/12): larger and brighter component of Arp 273 along with UGC 1813, a thin edge-on 1.3' SE.  At 488x the galaxy has an interesting chaotic appearance.  It contains a very small bright core, ~15" diameter, with a bright nucleus.  A mag 13.5 star is superimposed at the west edge of the core.  A spiral arm emerges at the north side of the core and bends counterclockwise east towards a mag 14 star 40" NE of center and then fades out.  The arm then reappears heading due south of the star for ~30", so the two sections seem detached at the star and unrelated. To the southwest of the core is a low surface brightness halo, increasing the overall size to 1.5'x1.0'.

 

18" (11/23/05): brighter and larger of an interacting pair with UGC 1813 1.3' SE.  At 225x appeared faint, moderately large, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 1.0'x0.6'.  The view is confused by a mag 13.5 star at the west edge and a mag 14 star at the ENE edge.  Broad, weak concentration with a very small, brighter core following the star on the west side.  Located 3' W of the striking double star STF 251= 8/9 at 2.2" and 1.8' SW of a mag 10.4 star.

 

17.5" (10/5/02): faint, small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, 0.8'x0.6'.  The main diffuse glow of the galaxy extends between a mag 13 just off the west side of the core and a mag 13.5 star at the east end of the halo.  The surface brightness is fairly low except for a very small brighter core just following the mag 13 star.  Located 1.8' SW of a mag 10 star and 3' W of ?251, a mag 8/9 2.5" pair that is a striking double at 263x.  An edge-on companion UGC 1813 (forming Arp 273) close SE was not seen.

 

17.5" (8/6/02): very faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 0.9'x0.6'.  Spans between two mag 13.5 stars on the NE end 40" from the core and superimposed on the west side just 19" from the core.  The core of the galaxy is just a slightly brighter knot just following the preceding star.  Two bright stars follow including mag 8.3 HD 14511 3.0' E and a mag 10 star 1.8' NE.  At 263x, the mag 8 star was resolved into a very close unequal double = STF 251 = 8/9 at 2.5".  Forms an interacting M51-type system (also classified as a collisional Ring galaxy) with UGC 1813 just 1.3' SE but the fainter companion was only marginally visible (viewed fairly low in the east).  This pair is Arp 273 and is a Perseus-Pisces Supercluster member.

48" (10/25/11): at 488x and 610x, this interesting ring galaxy (Arp 145) was composed of three components.  The brightest is the "collider" component (Anon 0220+41A) at the southeast edge of the "ring".  It appeared moderately bright, small, round, 20" diameter, high surface brightness, containing a very small bright nucleus.  The "ring" component generally appeared as a fairly large, roundish glow, at least 1.0' diameter, with an irregular surface brightness but no central brightening.  A 20" pair of mag 12/13 stars are superimposed on the south and southwest end of the glow and detract a bit from viewing.  Occasionally, though, the "ring" popped and a brighter rim and darker center appeared, mimicking a fairly large, weakly annular planetary nebula!

 

The third component was a very faint, extremely small "knot", perhaps 4" diameter (barely nonstellar), that was superimposed south of center.  It formed the north vertex of a small equilateral triangle (sides 15"-20") with the pair of stars.  This "knot" is classified as the ring nucleus (Arp 145:RN) in Madore's 2009 "Atlas of Collisional Ring Galaxies".  Arp 145 is located just 3.7' SE of mag 5.8 HD 14622 and the star was kept out of the field to avoid glare.  The ring and collider are given two PGC numbers, 9060 and 9062, although there is disagreement in NED and LEDA on which objects they apply to.

 

Arp 145 is located 42' SW of the center of AGC 347 and it has a matching redshift, so is an outlying member of the cluster.

18" (11/13/07): UGC 1841 is the brightest of three UGC galaxies in the field had a very strange appearance at 225x. The galaxy is dominated by a sharply concentrated 25"x20" core that appears to be elongated NW-SE.  Surrounding the core is a much larger, low surface brightness halo at least 2' in diameter.  The galaxy appears odd with the contrast between the dim halo and bright core and it happens to be sandwiched between mag 8.4 HD 146674 1.4' N of center and a mag 10.9 star 1.3' S!  The glare of these stars make it is difficult to gauge the edge of the halo, but it appears to extend perhaps 3/4 of the way between the stars.

 

Then I noticed the core was closely bracketed by two faint "stars -- one just off the SE edge and a second star jammed up against the NW end.  This probably contributed to the impression of elongation.  I had a suspicion these might not be stars due to their locations and checking NED the "star" at the SE end is a virtually stellar galaxy, V Zw 230 (a classification by Zwicky of compact galaxies), just 22" SE of the center of UGC 1841.  It turns out that UGC 1841 is a well-studied Seyfert (radio) galaxy with a designation 3C 66B and a short jet extending from the nucleus has been detected in radio, x-ray, infrared and optical wavelengths.  SIMBAD shows 337 journal references for this galaxy.  The star at the NW edge of the core is just 14" from the center.

 

Two additional UGC galaxies lie to the NW, UGC 1837 is just 2.7' NW, just beyond a mag 11 star close NW of UGC 1841 and UGC 1832 is 8.5' NW.  The blazar, 3C 66A (V = 13.8-15.6) lies 6.4' NW.  This entire remarkable field is at the northern outskirts of AGC 347 (similar redshift), just 40' N of NGC 891!

48" (10/26/16): UGC 2140 consists of the connected glow of HCG 18B, 18C and 18D.  Although Hickson assumed these were three interacting or merging galaxies, a recent study suggests this is a single highly irregular galaxy with several knots.  HCG 18D is the northwest component of the UGC 2140 chain and contains a fairly faint, very small knot, 6"-8".  This knot is embedded in a low surface brightness glow extending to the southeast and containing 18C and 18B.  Very faint haze bulges out just east of HCG 18B.  HCG 18C is the central component of UGC 2140.  Its nucleus appeared faint, very small, ~9"x6" and is surrounded by low surface extensions to the northwest and southeast, merging into HCG 18B on the southeast end.  HCG 18B is fairly faint, very elongated 3:1 or 4:1 NNW-SSE, perhaps 45"x12".  This portion of UGC 2140 is a similar to size as HCG 18A but has a fairly uniform surface brightness.  A mag 15.5-16 star lies 0.6' E.

 

17.5" (1/9/99): the combined glow of interconnected HCG 18B, C and D was glimpsed for moments as an extremely low surface brightness, elongated haze.  The glow appeared larger than HCG 18A just 1.5' SE, but I couldn't hold both objects simultaneously.

WH discovered UGC 2272 on 26 Oct 1786 (sweep 626) though wasn't certain if it was a nebula.  He recorded "A star of about 8th of 9th magnitude, with an extremely faint nebulosity about 1' north of it; but it so faint that there is a doubt whether it may not consist of 2 or 3 small stars only."  His position corresponds with UGC 2272, located 2' north-northwest of mag 7.6 HD 17382 but because of the doubt he didn't assign an internal discovery number.

24" (2/8/18): the main glow of Zwicky's Nonet appeared faint, small, slightly elongated, ~20" diameter.  I couldn't confidently resolve the two components G1 (B) and G3 (D) within this glow.  However, ~20" E is G7 (G), which was occasionally visible (V = 15.6, B = 16.7) and separated from the main glow. It was difficult to determine if it appeared nonstellar, but it was certainly 6" or less in size.

 

The designations are from the 2017 paper "Zwicky's Nonet: a compact merging ensemble of nine galaxies and 4C 35.06, a peculiar radio galaxy with dancing radio jets" and the 1982 paper by Schneider and Gunnl: "V Zw 311 - The once and future cD", respectively.

 

17.5" (1/9/99): this member of AGC 407 appears as a faint, diffuse, elongated glow with an irregular surface brightness, ~1' in length. Described in the UGC as a compact group of 7 galaxies.  The combined glow of these galaxies is both larger and more prominent than UGC 2493 5.7' SSE which is the brightest individual galaxy in AGC 407.

18" (3/19/04): this Seyfert galaxy was picked up at 73x (31 Nagler) as a slightly fuzzy "knot".  At 160x, either a sharp stellar nucleus ~14th magnitude is easily visible or a mag 14 star is superimposed at the center (appears to be the nucleus).  Surrounding the stellar nucleus is a very small halo, ~15" diameter and with averted vision a very low surface brightness hazy glow appears to surround this knot, perhaps 1.5' diameter though very difficult to determine extent.  A faint triangle of stars is superimposed on the NE edge of the extremely faint halo, ~1.3' from center.  This well-studied object (264 references in NED) contains an active galactic nucleus (S10838 = variable 14.4-15.5) and is a powerful X-ray and Gamma-ray source.  Located in a fairly rich star field.

48" (4/13/10): The Integral Sign galaxy was carefully observed at 510x.  This super-thin galaxy extended 3.3'x0.15' E-W for roughly a 20:1 axial ratio!  Near the west end of the galaxy there is a noticeable hook towards the northwest as the galaxy fades and ends at a very faint star or knot [there is an extremely small HII knot at the NW tip].  The low surface brightness portion near the west end has an irregular, streaky appearance with the impression of knotty structure near the tip.  The eastern end has a much more gradual, subtle bending so that the eastern tip is pointing due east, although the central portion of the galaxy is oriented WSW-ENE.  A mag 16 star is just off the north side, slightly west of center and a mag 15.5 star is off the south side where the hook begins on the western side. 

 

24" (2/5/13): at 125x the Integral Sign Galaxy was easily visible just south of a line connecting mag 6.4 HD 54070 12' ESE and mag 7.0 HD 52762 13' NW.  At 375x the galaxy extends 2.2'x0.2' (~12:1) ~E-W.  The galaxy has a fairly even surface brightness with just a slightly brighter core, though fades on the west end as it bends or hooks towards the north.  This extension has a very low surface brightness.  1' off the east end is a mag 14.5 star.  A fainter mag 15.5 is close south on the west side at the point where the galaxy bends north and dims. No structure or bending was seen on the east end and the brightness falls off rapidly at the tip.

 

18" (3/13/10): at 220x, the Integral Sign Galaxy appeared very faint, large, extremely thin edge-on streak ~10:1 oriented WSW-ENE, ~2.2'x0.2'.  Very weak concentrated with no core or zone and overall with a very low surface brightness.  In a group with much brighter UGC 3714 7.6' SE and extremely faint CGCG 330-32 13' SE.  Located 12' W of mag 6.4 HD 54070.

24" (2/5/13): this member of the UGC 3714 group appeared as a faint, low surface brightness glow, small, round, 18" diameter.  Situated at the center of an equilateral triangle (sides 3') of mag 13-14 stars.  The V magnitude (? 14) of this face-on Scd galaxy is misleading as the surface brightness is very low and only the slightly brighter core was picked up.  Located 20' N of UGC 3697 (Integral Sign Galaxy).

48" (4/6/13): Arp 141 is an unusual interacting system, listed as a Ring galaxy with collider in Madore, Nelson and Petrillo's 2009 "Atlas and Catalog of Collisional Ring Galaxies".  At the north end is VV 123B = Madore C1 (collider), which appeared bright, fairly small, round, 20" diameter, sharply concentrated with a very bright nucleus.  This is the brightest component in the system.  At the south edge of VV 123B (25" S of center) is VV 123A = Madore RN (Ring nucleus), which appeared fairly faint, small, irregularly round, 15" diameter.  The ring component extends south of VV 123A and appeared as a faint, moderately large, oval haze, ~60"x30", mostly evident as a brighter arc or tail along the west side.  This arc extends about as far south as a mag 14 star which is 1.5' SSW of VV 123B, though VV 123C, a small knot at the south end, was not resolved.  Viewed at 488x and 610x.

 

24" (1/25/14): at 375x, VV 123B appeared moderately bright, small, round, compact, 20" diameter, high surface brightness.  VV 123A, situated just 25" S (nucleus of the Ring component) was cleanly resolved and appeared very faint, very small, round, 12" diameter, low surface brightness.  The actual ring, extending south, was not seen.

?douard Stephan discovered UGC 3840 on 6 Feb 1874.  This galaxy was not included in any of his discovery lists, but was listed in Emmanuel Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's observations as an "Anonyme" nebula.  His description reads "vF, vS, R, bM, well-defined".  Apparently Stephan overlooked this object when compiling his lists, but it should have received a NGC designation.  As UGC 3842 is only slightly fainter, I'm surprised Stephan didn't pick up this galaxy at the same time.

24" (3/9/13): moderately bright to fairly bright, moderately large, oval 2:1 E-W, 1.3'x0.7', sharply concentrated with a bright 20" core.  The halo is fairly uniform except for the nucleus of superimposed KTG 18A, which was barely glimpsed as a stellar or quasi-stellar spot on the west side (30" from the center of UGC 3995).  A mag 11 star lies 1.8' S.  CGCG 148-5 = KTG 18C lies 4' ENE.

 

Although these overlapping galaxies form a physical pair, studies reveal neither galaxy is tidally perturbed.

48" (4/2/11): at 375x Holmberg II appeared as a fairly faint but very large, irregular ragged glow, roughly 5'x3.5' SSW-NNE with a low but irregular surface brightness and an ill-defined boundary.  A mag 12 star is superimposed just east of center with two 13.5/13 stars 34" SSW and 47" SE, respectively.  Just west of the brighter mag 12 star is small, fairly bright HII region (HSK 45 = HK 10), ~15" diameter.  A second, much fainter HII knot (HSK 70 = HK 4) with a diameter of ~10" is 30" following the mag 13 star (SE member of the triangle).  A similar third HII knot (HSK 73 = HK 1) lies 30" N.  Just off its north edge is a fourth extremely small knot (HSK 71 = HK 2).  The HSK designations are from "HII Regions of Holmberg II", PASP, 106, 309 (1994) and HK designations from Hodge and Kennicutt "At Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies" in AJ, 88, 296 (1983).

 

18" (3/13/10): this member of the M81 group was easily picked up at 175x as a fairly faint, very large, low surface brightness glow, roughly 5'x3.5' in diameter.  The outline is irregular, appearing elongated N-S at times, though more circular at other times.  A roughly equilateral triangle of stars (separations 35", 42", 46") is superimposted east of center and a mag 11 star is at the north edge.  There was no central concentration or zones.  A bright HII region is just west of the northern star in the triangle, but it was not noticed.

 

17.5" (2/9/02): immediately picked up at 140x as a large, very diffuse glow mostly west of a distinctive triple star (mag 11.5-12.5), which is situated along on the eastern edge of the galaxy!  The low surface glow is elongated ~3:2 N-S, ~4'x2.5', although the edges generally fade into the background so the size was difficult to estimate.  It appeared slightly brighter in the vicinity of the triple star [probably refers to HII region HSK 45].  The visibility of Holmberg II was surprisingly easy and it was quite obvious using averted vision although this object appeared more like a faint galactic nebula than a galaxy. I didn't note any of the HII regions seen on images.  Holmberg II is an irregular dwarf in the M81 group.

48" (4/7/13): at 375x appeared fairly bright, fairly small, brighter along a thin strip of the major axis, elongated 5:2 WSW-ENE, 20"x8", fairly high surface brightness.  A faint, thin spike extends out of the southwest side, though in very soft seeing I couldn't see the corresponding extension on the northeast end.  PGC 23359 lies 3.0' S.  Centered within a roughly equilateral triangle of 12th magnitude stars (sides at most 2'). 

 

On the SDSS image, this system appears to be a merger, with a warped, dusty, edge-on disc bisecting an elliptical and protruding out the ends.  Listed as a "Good Candidate for Polar-Ring Galaxies" in the 1990 "New Observations and a Photographic Atlas of Polar Ring Galaxies" (AJ, 100, 1489) but in a 2000 study "It is shown that its inclusion in a list of candidate galaxies with polar rings is erroneous. In reality, it is a spiral galaxy with a powerful bulge and a disturbed dust disk viewed edge-on."

48" (4/6/13): Arp 55 = "Grasshopper" is a merger of two galaxies with a single tidal tail on the east side.  At 488x it appeared bright, moderately large, very unusual appearance with a mottled main body elongated 2:1 SW-NE, ~30"x15".  On the southwest end is Arp 55S = PGC 3098124, a nearly stellar knot that is the nucleus of a merging, interacting companion.  A faint, thin "arm" or "tail" is attached at the NE end and extends ~20"x5" straight south. The tail brightens slightly (perhaps an HII knot or another merged galaxy) at the south end.  This knot has the designation SDSS J091556.72+441937.5.  On the SDSS the tail curves sharply west on the south end, but this extension was not seen.  A mag 16.2 star is 45" W.

 

SDSS J091559.93+442034.6 = LEDA 2242096 lies 0.9' NE and appeared as a very faint (V = 17.1), very low surface brightness patch, 15" diameter.  Arp called this object a "filament" of Arp 55 in his 1967 paper "Peculiar Galaxies and Radio Sources" (ApJ, 148, 321).  LEDA 82353 is 1.4' NE and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 20"x15".  LEDA 2242434 lies 2.3' NW, just 27" W of a mag 14.7 star.  It appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 20"x15".  These three galaxies have a identical redshifts as Arp 55, so are part of a small group.

 

18" (3/13/10): faint, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 0.5'x0.4'.  While viewing this interacting pair of disrupted galaxies (Arp 55), I occasionally noticed an extension (companion galaxy) or knot at the west edge. A couple of times it appeared resolved from the main glow as an extremely faint and small glow.  Located 5' NNE of mag 9.4 HD 79466.

48" (4/18/15): Sextans B is a nearby dwarf galaxy, generally considered to lie just outside the local group in a small group (including Sextans A).  It appeared as a large, fairly low surface brightness oval glow, extending 4:3 WNW-ESE, ~2.6'x1.9'.  It exhibits a broad weak concentration to a slightly brighter middle, but there is no distinct core or zones.  The surface brightness is irregular and slightly clumpy.  A mag 14.5 star is at the north edge of the galaxy and a mag 15 star is off the southeast edge of the galaxy.

 

A young (2 ? 1 billion years) massive globular cluster (SDSS J100004.63+052007.5) was discovered in 2007 in Sextans B using the HST WFPC2 and verified at the Special Astrophysical Observatory in Russia.  At V = 17.9 it appeared as an extremely faint "star" and was visible only intermittently, though repeatedly confirmed at the same position.  This object is located ~1.2' ENE of the center of Sextans B, close to the east edge of the galaxy.

 

18" (2/19/09): easily visible at 175x as a large, low surface brightness, oval patch, extended 3:2 NW-SE, ~3.0'x1.9'.  The glow is nearly parallel to two mag 13 stars off the NE side and extends roughly the separation of these stars (3').  This dwarf galaxy has only a broad, weak concentration with a slightly brighter core and an ill-defined edge to the halo as it fades at the periphery.  Still, the surface brightness is slightly irregular with a hint of mottling.  Located 8' NE of mag 7.7 HD 86610.

 

17.5" (2/1/03): This dwarf irregular galaxy probably lies just outside the local group (4.3 million l.y.) in a small group that includes NGC 3109, Sextans A and the Antlia Dwarf.  Picked up without difficulty at 100x, 8' NE of mag 7.7 SAO 118040 (middle of three on a line with two mag 11 stars).  At 140x, Sextans B appeared as a large, oval glow, elongated 3:2 WNW-ESE, ~3.5'x2.2', with a low surface brightness and broad, weak concentration.  The surface seems slightly irregular or mottled and four fainter stars are near the periphery.  This galaxy was surprisingly easy though I had never searched for it before.

17.5" (4/5/97): this is the brightest member of the distant group HCG 45.  Not seen with any certainty at 220x.  At 280x with concentration, the galaxy pops into view momentarily 15-20% of the time just west of a line connecting two nearby mag 13 stars [48" N and 55" SE].  Appears barely nonstellar, which implies only the core of this edge-on was glimpsed.

UGC 5596 (similar brightness) lies 15' N.

 

UGC 5600 is classified as a "Good Candidate for a Polar-Ring Galaxy" in the 1990 photographic atlas of polar-ring galaxies.  Interestingly, UGC 5609 = VV 330a is also a Ring galaxy with a knot or nucleus along an oval ring!  The two galaxies have nearly identical redshifts, so the ring morphologies is likely caused by a direct collision.

48" (5/2/19): at 545x; this unusual galaxy appeared moderately bright, with a 3:1 central bar oriented E-W and a slightly brighter core.  A  semi-elliptical glow (halo) extends to the south of the bar.  The interior of the oval was slightly brighter, forming a very subtle ring.

 

48" (2/19/12): at 488x, the bright portion of the galaxy is an elongated bar oriented E-W and extending 0.6'x0.2'.  A faint oval glow extends off the south side of the bar.  I had the strong impression of a slightly darker region in the glow [this corresponds with the interior of a spiral arm] just south of the bar, particularly on the west side.  A mag 13.3 star is 0.9' SW and a mag 17 star is a similar distance NW.  A brighter mag 10.9 star is 1.8' NNW.

 

Arp 291 was placed in Arp's category of "double galaxies with wind effects" and was classified by Theys and Spiegel as a Ring galaxy (type RK4) in the 1976 paper "Ring Galaxies. I" (ApJ 208, 650).  But Romano et al classify it as a misclassified ring that "resembles a one-armed spiral emanating at the end of a bar" in "Stellar Disks of Collisional Ring Galaxies" (AJ 136, 1259,2008).

48" (4/15/10): I was surprised to find that all five members were visible without much effort at 700x, which cleanly resolved the 1.1' N-S chain into five "knots", strung out like beads on a necklace.  While at the eyepiece, I carefully described the relative placement of all the components to Jim Chandler, who verified the descriptions using the DSS image on a laptop.

 

55A: at 700x, the brightest member of the HCG 55 (UGC 6514) chain appeared moderately bright, slightly elongated, small, ~15"x12".  This galaxy is the middle of 5 in the 1.1' chain with 55E 12" N and 55C 19" S.

 

55B: southernmost member of five in the chain and second brightest.  At 700x, it was easily visible as a fairly faint, very small knot, ~10" diameter.

 

55C: this member of HCG 55 was the 4th of five in terms of visibility at 700x and appeared very faint and small, with a low surface brightness halo that faded out into the background.  Squeezed between 55A 19" N and 55B 15" S.

 

55D: northernmost galaxy in the 5-member galaxy chain (total length 1.1').  At 700x it appeared faint, very small, round, ~8" diameter.  In terms of visibility, I placed this member as 3rd of 5.

 

55E: this galaxy was the smallest and faintest (B = 17.4) of 5 in the HCG 55 chain.  At 700x it appeared extremely faint and small, round, ~4" diameter.  Sandwiched between 55D just 9" NNW and 55A just 12" SSW!  This galaxy has a discordant redshift (over twice the redshift of the other 4 members), so appears to be a superimposed member, though it is situated right along the chain.

 

17.5" (6/14/96): at 220x, HCG 55 appears as an extremely faint, elongated string SSW-NNE about 1' in length.  The appearance was faint enough to require averted vision (can hold steadily ~80% of time) but appears irregular.  At 280x, a couple of individual components (A and either B or C) are sometimes resolved with the more obvious "knot" at the north end of the string (HCG 55a) appearing barely nonstellar.  This well known chain contains a discordant redshift (55e) and is located 25' NW of NGC 3735.

48" (4/19/17): at 375x and 488x; bright, fairly large, edge-on 3:1 or 7:2 NW-SE,  ~1.4'x0.4'.  Very unusual asymmetric appearance with two thin spiral arms.  Contains a bright, relatively large oval core NW-SE.  A very thin bright arm stretches from the west side of the core towards the northeast, bending very slightly to the east.  A symmetrically placed thin bright arm is attached on the east side of the core and stretches nearly straight southwest along the eastern flank, heading towards VV 286b, a merged companion ~45" SW of center at the edge of the halo.  The surface brightness of the halo has a much lower, irregular surface brightness east of the northern arm and west of the southern arm.  At 488x, VV 286b (interacting companion at the southwest end) appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, oval 5:3 E-W, ~15"x9".

17.5" (5/4/02): this galaxy is mistakenly identified as NGC 3984 in modern catalogues including RC3 and the Uranometria 2000 atlas (first edition).  It was not noticed in the field initially as two mag 12/13.5 stars (separation 15") are superimposed on the SW side and the galaxy is just a weak glow mostly following the pair.  Appears round, although the halo is ill-defined, and perhaps 0.8' in diameter.

24" (6/4/16): UGC 6945a = VV 126b and UGC 6945b = VV 126a form a 40" pair (Arp 194), apparently connected by a bridge.  At 260x; UGC 6945a, the brighter northwest component, appeared faint, small, roundish, 20".  UGC 6945b, the southeastern component, is faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter.  The two glows are separated by 40" and the halos were cleanly separated.

 

Although Arp and UGC considered Arp 194 a connected double system, the HST image clearly shows that UGC 6945a consists of two colliding galaxies in the process of merging.  A tidal tail, consisting of blue complexes of super star clusters, heads towards UGC 6945b.  I wasn't able to use higher power in soft seeing to resolve the two nuclei of UGC 6945a.

18" (4/5/03): extremely faint, moderately large.  Appears as a very low surface brightness hazy region with very weak concentration.  Two faint stars are superimposed; the brighter is 14.5 magnitude and is north of center.  It was difficult to judge the size as the low surface brightness halo blends into the background, but seems roughly 1.5'.  This galaxy was assumed to be NGC 4025, located 19' SSE but based on the superimposed stars and very low surface brightness I was able to identify this object.

48" (4/7/13): I ran across this object in Vorontsov-Velyaminov's paper "Nine enigmatic new objects" (Soviet Astronomy Letters, vol. 1, p.23, 1975). He nicknames it the "Sign" and describes "Four condensations are so arranged as to resemble a cross. The knot at the apex is a double, while the one at the bottom of the cross is elongated and larger than the others. The space between them is filled with bright diffuse radiation. Especially remarkable is the fact that this radiation gives the impression of streamers everywhere directed towards the brighter condensation. The diffuse and amorphous appearances of all the knots indicates that this complex is galactic in nature."  In his 1975 "Atlas of Interacting Galaxies, Part 2", the nickname "Apparition" is given.

 

At 488x, the core (assigned a MAC designation in Megastar) appeared moderately bright, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 0.3'x0.2', fairly high surface brightness.  Extending to the northeast is a large, low surface brightness halo, which appeared irregular and knotty.  This offset halo increased the overall size of the galaxy to ~1.2'x0.8'.  On the east end of the halo is a nearly stellar 16-17th mag knot [SDSS J131245.19+224959.0 at 50" ENE of the core].  A second low surface brightness knot is at the northeast edge [SDSS J131244.92+225018.0 at 1.0' NE of the core].  A third very low contrast knot is 40" NE of the core (SDSS J131243.49+225018.1).  The SDSS image reveals these are the brightest of a large number of blue knots.

 

PGC 1677429 = 2MASX J13124913+2251519 lies 2.6' NE and appeared faint, small, round, 18" diameter.  No redshift is given in NED or SDSS for this galaxy (brighter member of an interacting pair with tidal tails), so I don't know if it's related to VV 559, although it's aligned with its major axis.

48" (5/14/12): MCG +10-19-056, the northwest member of Arp 238 has a slightly elongated bright core, ~20"x15" that gradually increases to the center.  At the west side of the core a very faint "arm" extends ~15" NW then hooks a very short distance north.  The core of similar MCG +10-19-057 = VV 250a is just 36" between centers with the two galaxies faintly connected at the center.

 

The southeast member MCG +10-19-057 has a bright round core ~15" diameter that increases to the center.  The core is similar to the northwest galaxy, but has a slightly higher surface brightness.  The extension or tidal arm attached at the east end was not seen.  By an unusual coincidence, two similar stars are very close in the same relative orientation and separation as the cores of the galaxies!  A mag 13.5 star lies 40" NE of MCG +10-19-057 and a mag 14.2 star is 32" NE of MCG +10-19-056!

48" (4/15/10): this galaxy is the brightest in a chain of four with several other small galaxies nearby in the field.  At 510x it appeared fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.6'x0.4'.  CGCG 161-135 lies 1.4' S, 2MASX J13442141+2955112 lies 1.2' NW.  Member of AGC 1781.

 

18" (6/21/03): very faint, small, irregularly round, 25"x20".  Collinear with three mag 11 stars to the NW.  A mag 14.3 star lies 1.6' NNE.  This galaxy is the brightest in a chain of four.  A extremely faint glow (2MASXi J1344214+295511) or star 1' NW was suspected at 215x and was possibly nonstellar at 323x (not confirmed).

 

17.5" (6/8/02): faint, small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE.  Nearly collinear with three stars to the NW (nearly equally spaced and 5' S of a mag 10 star.  In a small chain of 4 galaxies (only one viewed) in the group WBL 466.  This group is superimposed on the rich cluster AGC 1781, whose brightest member, NGC 5287, lies 10' SE.

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; the main body of Mrk 273 appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 5:3 ~N-S. It was strongly concentrated with a very bright elongated core that increased to a nearly stellar nucleus.  A subtle bulge was noticed on the SW edge. This is probably a merged interacting companion [on the SDSS the "bulge" has a blue color].  A very easy, large narrow tidal tail extended south as a very long "spike", perhaps 40"x6"!  A mag 16.4 star is 0.6' NE.  MCG +09-23-002, a thin edge-on, lies 3.4' SW.

 

24" (6/21/20): at 375x; fairly faint, small, oval 3:2 N-S, ~18"x12".  Occasionally I seemed to glimpse an extension (tidal tail) to the south, though it was too faint to estimate a length and difficult to confirm.   MCG +09-23-002 lies 3.4' SW and MCG +09-23-003 is 6' N.  Located 4.3' W of mag 6.5 HD 11999.

 

18" (6/12/10): easily picked up at 175x.  At 260x it appeared faint, small, elongated 5:2 N-S, 0.6'x0.25'.  A mag 12 star lies 1.5' N of center.  Located 4.3' due west of mag 6.5 HD 119992 which made viewing more difficult unless it was placed outside the field.  Forms a pair with MCG +09-23-002 3.3' SW.

 

17.5" (6/18/93): faint, very small, very compact (core viewed) but hint of extension (tail?) to S.  A mag 13 star lies 1' N.  Located 4.5' W of mag 6.5 SAO 28878 which detracts from viewing.  Forms a pair with MCG +09-23-002 3' WSW.

 

This Seyfert and ultraluminous infrared galaxy is commonly known as Mrk 273.  It contains a double nucleus (1" separation)) with a single, spectacular tidal tail 130,000 light-years long and a 'ring' of star formation.  Much of the activity in the system is associated with the northern nucleus where there is a considerable amount of young star formation.

William Herschel discovered UGC 8902 on 19 Mar 1787 and recorded "Suspected, vF, vS.  With 300 probably 2 or 3 small stars; just north of a bright star."  His position is 3.8' too far south but his comment "just north of a bright star" pins down the identification.  Because of his uncertainty in the observation, he didn't assign an internal number or a catalogue designation.  Interestingly, this object is the third in a row on the sweep (the other two are IC 944 and IC 946) that were described as "suspected" and hence were rejected, although all three are valid!

17.5" (6/14/96): very faint, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, low even surface brightness.  Searched for after viewing NGC 5459 25' N.  A mag 15 star lies 1' S.  Reference to DSS shows this "star" is MCG +02-36-034 = CGCG 074-087 = VV 328b which forms an interacting pair with UGC 9002.

The surface brightness is very low and nearly uniform, only dropping off gradually at the tips.  Could nearly hold steadily at 220x with concentration.

 

17.5" (6/27/98): not seen initially at 220x.  Switching to 280x (7mm Pentax) and using averted vision, a very thin ghostly streak became evident oriented WSW-ENE, perhaps 2.5'x0.3'.  The geometric "center" of the galaxy appears to be 1' NW of a mag 12.5 star, although the streak did not brighten towards the center.  With concentration the galaxy could almost be held steadily with averted vision.

24" (7/6/13): at 322x appeared fairly faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.  This Seyfert galaxy has an unusual appearance as it is dominated by a sharp stellar nucleus, surrounded by a small, round halo or shell that is low surface brightness but well defined.

 

A 2009 HST image captured a ring of brilliant blue stars encircling a bright, active nucleus, whose monster black hole is blasting material into space at over 14 million km/hr. Viewed nearly face-on, Mrk 817 shows intense star-forming regions and dark bands of interstellar dust along its spiral arms.

48" (5/9/18): at 610x; VV 264b (northwest spiral) appeared fairly bright, small, round, 12"-15" diameter, stellar nucleus.  VV 264b is the NW component of Arp 241 and is slightly smaller than VV 264a, just 16" SE.  I didn't notice the very low surface brightness tidal tail extending north. The halos of this interacting pair are merged.  VV 264a is the slightly larger SE component of Arp 241.  It appeared fairly bright, fairly small, oval 5:4 NW-SE, ~20"x16".  Contains a small, brighter core but no stellar nucleus. A very diffuse short extension to the south was just visible (beginning of the tidal tail) before quickly dimming out.

 

24" (6/29/16): Arp 241 is a close encounter of two spiral galaxies with the interaction resulting in pair of graceful, opposing tidal tails forming a "sprinkler" appearance.  The two nuclei are separated by only 16" and were resolved at 375x.  The brighter and larger southeast component (VV 264a) appeared fairly faint, small, round, ~15" diameter, stellar or quasi-stellar nucleus.  The northwest component (VV 264b) is faint, very small, round, ~10" diameter, with a very small brighter nucleus.  Arp 241 is located 12' WNW of NGC 5706/5709 pair and resides at a distance of roughly 475 million light years.

 

18" (7/2/11): faint, small, round, ~20" diameter (or slightly larger), can hold steadily at 285x.  The two nuclei were not resolved.

WH discovered UGC 9473 on 16 May 1787 (sweep 738) and noted "a small patch, very faint".  Apparently he was uncertain of the observation and didn't assign it an internal discovery number, but the time was noted as 1 min 6 sec after NGC 5732 (the previous object in the sweep), and 13' north.  Close to this offset is UGC 9473 (Harold Corwin puts his position just 10 sec of time following the galaxy).  So, this is another pre-NGC discovery that was not assigned an NGC designation.  I sent an e-mail notification to Corwin and Steinicke on 9 Oct 2014.

With careful viewing I could resolve the two components [centers separated by 36"]. The northern member (MCG +04-35-019 = VV 340a) is longer and thinner and appears barely detached from the star.  The southern member (MCG +04-35-018 = VV 340b) seems attached to the star and a bit stubbier.  2MASX J14570243+2441086 lies 4.5' due north.  Located 10' SW of mag 6.9 HD 132304.

 

According to the HST press release in 2008, "Arp 302, provides a textbook example of colliding galaxies seen in the early stages of their interaction...An enormous amount of infrared light is radiated by the gas from massive stars that are forming at a rate similar to the most vigorous giant star-forming regions in our own Milky Way."

24" (7/7/13): the Ursa Minor Dwarf was immediately noticed at 125x (21mm Ethos) with a 50' field of view as an extremely large, roughly oval glow WSW-ENE, extending nearly 30'x20'.  The edge was noticed first, particularly along the entire northern side where it has a slightly high contrast than the background.  Barely off the ENE end is a mag 10.3 star and roughly at the WSW end is mag 9.4 SAO 16604.  A mag 10.7 star is superimposed slightly NE of center.  With extended viewing the entire galaxy was seen as an extremely low surface brightness glow and the outline could be traced around fully.

 

IC 1110, a small edge-on, lies 20' NE of center and 7' further ENE than the mag 10.3 star mentioned above.  At 320x it appeared fairly faint, edge-on 4:1 WSW-ENE, 0.6'x0.15', very small bright core, distinct stellar nucleus. 

 

18" (6/21/09): at 73x (31mm Nagler), I felt confident about detecting this local group dwarf as an extremely large, very low surface brightness "stain" by scanning in the field.  The very weak brightening appeared roughly 25'x18' or possibly as large as 30'x20', oriented WSW-ENE.  The southern border was noticed first (perhaps this was the northern border -- see 24" observation) as it appeared to have a slightly higher contrast or edge against a darker background further south.  With extended viewing, the entire glow occasionally stood out above the surrounding background.  A mag 9.4 star is just off the SW side and a mag 10 star is superimposed a little NE of the center.

The southern component appeared faint to fairly faint, small, contains a very small brighter nucleus with a much fainter halo slightly elongated NW-SE, ~20"x15".  The northern component (PGC 200325) appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter, stellar nucleus.  The faint halo was compromised due to the bright star at the edge.  Brightest in a group with UGC 10045 3.6' SW, CGCG 022-043 lies 8' ESE and CGCG 022-039 12' WNW.

48" (4/6/13): UGC 10049 = HCG 77 is a very small quartet, 1.4'x0.6', oriented N-S.  At 488x, HCG 77A appeared moderately bright, small, round, 18" diameter, high surface brightness.  HCG 77B, just 15" N, was cleanly resolved at 375x and well split at 488x. HCG 77B appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, very small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 15"x10", high surface brightness.  HCG 77C/D lies 25" N.  HCG 77C appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated NW-SE, ~28"x22", even surface brightness except for a faint knot at the south edge (HCG 77D).  HCG 77D appeared very faint, very small, round, 8" diameter.  On the SDSS, this object is resolved into two very compact blue knots, which appear to be HII regions at the south edge of HCG 77C.

 

18" (8/3/05): at 257x, HCG 77A and 77B appeared as a soft elongated patch, extended N-S, ~20"x10".  With concentration the glow appeared clumpy and at moments A or B would resolve into two 10" knots, although it was very difficult to view both simultaneously.  Two mag 14.5 and 15 stars are close following and a brighter, wider pair of stars is SW.  Located 7' NW of a mag 10 star.

 

17.5": HCG 77A and B appear as an extremely faint, elongated glow measuring 30"x15" in a N-S orientation.  A mag 15 star is 1' SE and a slightly fainter star 1.3' E.  For moments only, resolved into two components (77A and 77B have a total length of 0.5') although extremely difficult to view these simultaneously.

17.5" (9/1/02): very faint, small, elongated ~E-W, 0.5'x0.3', low surface brightness.  The previous month I mistook fainter MCG +09-26-052 located 12' NNW for this galaxy from the Sierra Buttes.  In poorer conditions (haze from fires cut down transparency) I couldn't see MCG +09-26-052.

At the north end of the small HCG 81 quartet with HCG 81 C/D (single glow) 35" SSE and HCG 81B 51" S.  Forms the southeast vertex of an equilateral triangle with two mag 12.5/13 stars 2.5' N and WNW.  HCG 81C/D appeared as a single (merged?) very faint glow, very small, irregularly round, ~12" diameter.  HCG 81B at the south end of the chain appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 10" diameter.  CGCG 80-2 (brighter than the individual components of HCG 81) lies 5' S.

 

24" (6/16/12): HCG 81A and similar 81B were the only two members of this extremely compact quartet that were clearly resolved at times.  At 322x, both appeared extremely faint and small, round, 8" diameter.  Although not resolved, HCG 81C and D appeared as an extremely faint glow ~20" NNE of 81B and the "clump" of 81B/C/D was more evident than 81A. The entire quartet spans 51" N-S with 81A at the north end and 81B at the south end.  Two mag 12.5 stars 2.5' NNW and 2.5' WNW form an equilateral triangle with the group and are helpful with pinpointing the location.

48" (4/5/13): three components of this small quadruple group (fits within a 1.5' circle) were seen at 375x in soft seeing.  The dominant component (UGC 10321 NED01 = VV 129a) appeared fairly faint, small, round, 18" diameter.  VV 129c is situated 0.6' N and appeared faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  On the DSS, a tidally stretched arm of VV 129a extends towards VV 129c.  Also VV 129c appears double on the SDSS image, although I only noted a single object.  MCG +04-38-047 = VV 129e is the eastern component, 1.1' NE of VV 129a.  It appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.  VV 129d (furthest north) was not seen.  VV 129b appears to be a stretched arm of VV 129a on the SDSS.  A group of four mag 14/15/15.5/15.5 stars is ~1.5' S.  VV 129a was the site of SN 2011dl.

 

24" (7/7/13): at 282x, three components of VV 129 were resolved.  VV 129a = UGC 10321 NED01, the brightest member, appeared very faint, small, round, 18", visible continuously.  VV 129c, just 35" N, appeared extremely faint, small, round, 10" diameter.  VV 129e = MCG +04-38-047 lies 1.1' NE and appeared extremely faint (V = 16.2), very small, round, 12" diameter.

SDSS J162653.96+513338.2 is the companion noted by Arp: "Spiral galaxies with small high surface brightness companions on arms".  It is mentioned in the UGC notes as a "Blue condensation 0.12' x 0.10' at 0.35' north center, probably at tip of spiral arm" but is not catalogued in NED or HyperLeda.

After careful viewing for a couple of minutes, I could occasionally glimpse an extremely faint quasi-stellar knot, <5" diameter at the north end (~20" from the center).  The companion is not catalogued in NED or HyperLeda, but has the SDSS designation SDSS J162653.96+513338.2.

48" (5/10/18): at 610x; the main southern galaxy appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:3 or 2:1 SSW-NNE, ~18"x10".  It was brighter and mottled along the major axis but with a fairly low surf brightness.  There was a strong impression of an extension or tail to the SSW, increasing the size to nearly 30"x10".  A very faint mag 17.7 star was visible very close north [17"].  The southern end of the hook-shaped northern galaxy was seen as a low surface brightness glow, slightly elongated, 12"-15" in length, but the actual "sickle" portion to the north was not seen.

An extremely faint glow was noted 27" east of center, but the SDSS reveals this is a very close pair of extremely faint stars.  Jimi Lowrey felt he detected the tail to the north, but I was unable to confirm.

 

24" (7/7/13): at 282x appeared as a faint, elongated glow with a brighter elongated knot oriented N-S on the south side.  The fainter northern component occasionally resolved into a very faint, very small glow, ~10" diameter.

 

UGC 10402 = VV 560 is an interacting pair of disturbed spirals.  On the SDSS, the pair has a "Sickle" shape, with the fainter curved section at the north end and the elongated "handle" at the south end.

Unusual appearance as this galaxy passes through a 12th-magnitude star and appears as a "jet" or thin filament extending up in the eyepiece field to the south of this star.  With careful viewing the galaxy is also visible a little bit north of the superimposed star, so it not situated at the edge.  A mag 15.5 star is just preceding the southwest edge and the galaxy extends just a little further south than this star.  A shallow arc of mag 11-13 stars is close following.

24" (9/14/12): at 325x, faint to fairly faint, moderately large, roundish, roughly 45" diameter.  View hampered by a mag 10 star superimposed just NE of center.  In addition a mag 12 star is just off the NW side, though the halo has a very low surface brightness and fades into the glare from the stars.  Contains a very small weakly brighter core just SW of the mag 10 star.  Located 2.8' ESE of NGC 7265 in a group (USGC U813).  PGC 214825 lies 2.2' N.

 

17.5" (10/13/01): this companion to NGC 7265 (situated 2.8' ESE) was difficult to pick out in fairly poor seeing as it was lost in the glare of a mag 10.5 star attached at the NE side.  Just a low surface brightness haze was evident on the west and SW side of the star but the glow just faded into the background as it had no distinct edge.

 

17.5" (8/12/88): very faint, very small, round.  A mag 12 star attached at the NE end 17" from center detracts.  Located 2.8' ESE of NGC 7265.

24" (10/5/13): picked up at 200x as a faint, large, very diffuse elongated glow with a couple of stars superimposed.  This Local Group dwarf appeared roughly 4.0'x2.0', extended WNW-ESE.  The surface brightness is quite low and fairly even, except for a slightly brighter 30" patch (core?) near the center.  A mag 14 star is just within the ESE end (the patch is ~1' WNW of this star) and a brighter mag 12.7 star is embedded on the south side of WNW end.

At 100x a very low surface brightness hazy region with no concentration was visible just following a trio of mag 12 stars.  It was very difficult to estimate the dimensions and orientation as the halo gradually faded into the background but the faint glow appeared roughly 4'x2', extended WNW-ESE.  Also viewed at 140x, although no other details were seen.  I would have passed right over this object without a finder chart and use of low power.
