NGC 7000 = LBN 373 = Sh 2-117 = Ced 183d = North American Nebula

20 59 18 +44 31; Cyg

Size 120'x100'


18" (7/16/07): superb view of the entire North American nebula in the 80mm finder at 12.5x and at 73x in the 18-inch with UHC filters in both.  The entire outline of the U.S., Mexico and Central America was well-defined and very high contrast with the surrounding dark fields particularly around the Gulf of Mexico region (LDN 935) and the West Coast.  A 7th magnitude star is at the edge of the center of the gulf (Texas area) and another 7th magnitude star is at the south tip of Florida.  The "Baja peninsula" and Central American extension jut out very prominently from the gulf region. The edge of the northern Canadian region is less well defined.  Open cluster NGC 6997 was very prominent on the East Coast (west side of the nebula).  It was breathtaking to scan around the entire outline, though it overfilled the 67' field.


17.5" (7/17/93): at 100x and OIII filter appears very bright, extremely large (fills several fields), amazingly high contrast around the "Gulf" of Mexico and "Baja" region (LDN 935) and to a lesser extent along the west and east coasts.  I traced around the entire border except for the "Canada" region, which consists mostly of scattered star fields with weak nebulosity.  The open cluster NGC 6997 is easily picked out in the NE section.


8" (5/26/84): bright, very large, sharp border and details around the "Gulf" section, "Southwest border" and "Baja region".  Rich with faint stars.  Viewed with a Rich Field adapter at 33x-50x.


80mm (8/23/84): striking contrast at 16x using a filter at Mt. Rose.


80mm (5/26/84): bright with a well-defined "Gulf" region at 13x using a narrowband filter.


Naked-eye: Easy naked-eye glow in a dark sky, though this is mostly from the rich Milky Way star cloud and not the involved nebulosity.  The contrast is highest on the southwest side where the star cloud and nebulosity is adjacent to the dark "Gulf of Mexico" region.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7000 = H V-37 = h2096 on 24 Oct 1786 (sweep 620) and recorded "vL. Diffused nebulosity plainly visible, bM, 7 or 8' length, 6' broad and losing itself gradually."  In the next few minutes of the sweep he also commented, "All this time suspected diffuse nebulosity through the whole breadth of the sweep."  He gave two positions at the east and southwest coast of the North American nebula, which became numbers 44 (Southeast US) and 46 (Central America region) in his list of 52 regions with "extensive diffused nebulosity."  Arthur Auwers wrote (in a review of the General Catalogue) that JH omitted this large object, but NGC 7000 = GC 4621.


German Astronomer Max Wolf referred to this HII region as "The 'America' Nebula" in a 1902 German paper based on an image taken in 1901.  In the 1903 paper "Diffused nebulosities in the heavens", Barnard refers to the object photographed by Wolf and states "The "North America Nebula" would perhaps be more definite, for it is North America to which Dr. Max Wolf intends the compliment."  Agnes Mary Clerke refered to it as the "America" Nebula in the caption of Wolf's photograph in her 1905 second edition of "The System of the Stars"

NGC 7005

21 01 57.3 -12 52 53; Aqr


17.5" (7/24/95): small very unimpressive asterism of five stars including three mag 12 stars in a 1.5' right triangle and three additional mag 14 stars.  Only noticeable at all due to the three brighter stars in a small group.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7005 on 23 Aug 1855 with an 4.5-inch Fraunhofer refractor at Leipzig and noted a "nebulous star cluster".  His position is 45' southeast of M73.  This was the first object discovered by d'Arrest (along with the double star NGC 607).  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Arthur Auwers observed it on 9 Sep 1861 at Königsberg and logged "not a nebula, but only a triangle of three stars."  Herbert Howe called it "simply a coarse cluster, the 3 brightest stars being 9th mag.  No nebulosity discernable."  Reinmuth gave a similar description based on its appearance on a Heidelberg plate.

NGC 7006

21 01 29.3 +16 11 15; Del

V = 10.6;  Size 2.8';  Surf Br = 0.1


24" (7/11/18): at 375x; bright, very bright mottled core with half-dozen very faint stars resolved around the edges of the halo.  Three very faint to extremely faint galaxies lies to the southwest; CGCG 448-030 3.6' WSW, LEDA 1501723 6' WSW and CGCG 448-029 7.4' SW.


18" (7/24/06): this small globular was viewed at 435x and 565x and it appeared very mottled and lively in excellent seeing.  Two or three very faint stars were visible pretty steadily and a number of extremely faint mag 16 stars appeared to sharpen up and momentarily sparkle, particularly in the 1.5' to 2' halo.  Perhaps a total of a dozen stars, sparkled or popped in and out of view.


CGCG 448-030 is located just 3.6' SW of the core of NGC 7006!  It appeared extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter.  Requires averted and cannot hold steadily but repeatedly reacquired.  There is an extremely faint star at the northeast edge which was sometimes noticed instead of the galaxy.  Forms the south vertex of a small triangle with two mag 12.7/13.5 stars ~0.6' N and NE. It is nearly on a line between the globular and mag 7.3 HD 200079 10' SW.


CGCG 448-028 is 11.6' NW of NGC 7006.  It appeared faint, small, round, 20" diameter, even surface brightness.  Visible with direct vision.  A wide pair of mag 11.5 stars lies 2.5' NNW.  This is the brighter of the two galaxies observed near NGC 7006.


17.5" (8/5/94): moderately bright, small, 1.5' diameter containing a 1' core and a small halo.  The core has a broad weak concentration with no nucleus.  The halo is mottled but difficult to achieve clear resolution.  Around the edges of the halo four or five mag 15.5 stars or fainter pop in and out of view.  The easiest resolved star is just at the north edge of the halo, a close pair is at the east edge and a single star is at the southeast side.  An easy pair of mag 14 foreground stars at 20" separation is off the south side 1.6' from the center.  The interacting system UGC 11672 lies 43' E.


13.1" (6/29/84): fairly faint, small, small bright nucleus, small fainter halo.  Mottled and clumpy but not resolved at 360x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7006 = H I-52 = h2097 on 21 Aug 1784 (sweep 253) and recorded "pB, iR, easily resolvable, about 1' diam.  Hazy, otherwise I suppose I might see the stars in it."  On 16 Oct 1784 (sweep 294), he logged "vB, R, mbM, the brightness extending a good way, resolvable (see 253 sweep)."  John Herschel made the single observation "B; R; gbM; 60".  RA from working list, no transit being procured."

30" (10/10/15 - OzSky): at 394x; bright, moderately large, elongated 5:3 N-S, ~1.25'x0.75', sharply concentrated with a very bright core that increases to a stellar nucleus.  A string of 5 mag 12-13 stars (oriented E-W) passes to the south and a mag 15.6 star is 0.8' W of center.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7007 = h3850 on 8 Jul 1834 and recorded "pB; vS; R; pslbM; 12"."  His mean position (3 observations) is accurate.  Joseph Turner observed it on 5 Sep 1877 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope and notes it was suddently brighter in the middle to a nucleus.(p. 142 of logbook).

NGC 7008 = PK 93+5.2 = PN G093.4+05.4 = Ced 186 = Fetus Nebula

21 00 32.8 +54 32 36; Cyg

V = 11.0;  Size 98"x75"


48" (10/24/14): We had a superb view of NGC 7008 unfiltered at 488x and 610x. This irregular, annular planetary extended ~1.5'x1.2' SSW-NNE with a roughly oval outline, except on the southwest end.  Several stars are involved or just off the edge, including h1606 = 9.6/11.7 at 19” separation, which is just off the SSE edge.  A very bright, elongated knot is at the NNE edge of the rim. A larger elongated knot is just on its inside (towards the central star), with the pair of close knots virtually attached.  On the opposite SSW end is the next brightest region, extending nearly 45° along the rim.  This larger glow spreads irregularly into the darker center and dims.  Another brighter knot is on the WNW edge of the rim (probably K 4-44), just northeast of a mag 14 star that is close off the west edge.  Finally, another slightly brighter knot is at the east edge of the rim, close south of a mag 14 star on the northeast side.  The entire southwest side appears as if it was "nibbled" around the edges, as part of the outer edge is missing.  A mag 13.5 star sits in the center of the darker interior with the central "hole" darkest immediately east of the central star. Another darker region is in the southeast quadrant just north of h1606.


18" (9/10/07): The "Fetus Nebula" is a fascinating annular planetary, best viewed at high power.  Using 452x the oval halo is elongated SSW-NNE, ~85"x65".  The most striking feature is a bright, 25" knot on the NNE end that is irregular in surface brightness with a very small brighter condensation near its south end.  The SW quadrant of the planetary is also brighter in an elongated region and it is weakest on the east and SE edge facing the wide double star off the south edge.  In the darker center, a mag 13.5 central star is visible and a second fainter mag 14 star is near the NE edge.  Also a mag 14 star is just off the west edge.  NGC 7008 is situated just north of h1606, a mag 9.3/10.2 pair at 18" oriented N-S.


17.5" (6/28/00): this beautiful, highly structured PN is situated just north of a wide double star (9.2/10.5 at 18"). At 280x, the annular oval is elongated SSW-NNE, ~90"x65".  A bright 30" irregular knot is prominent at the NE end.  The SW end of the major axis has a fainter condensation and the rim is clearly dimmest near the double star.  The mag 14 central star shines steadily as does a slightly fainter mag 14.5 on the NE edge.  Just off the west edge is another 14th magnitude star.  The darker center is faintly luminous and the surface brightness is irregular over the entire oval giving a mottled, wispy appearance.


13" (9/11/82): bright planetary with unusual structure and several stars involved.  The striking complete annular ring is elongated SW-NE.  A mag 14 central star mag is visible as well as a mag 14 star at the NE edge and a faint star is off the west edge.  A small brighter knot marks the NE end.  The planetary is located just north of h1606 = 9.3/10.5 at 18" separation.


8" (9/11/82): unusual structure, curves and extends further south on the west side.  A faint star is embedded.


80mm (9/10/07):  the planetary was faintly visible in the finder at 25x using an OIII filter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7008 = H I-192 = h2099 on 14 Oct 1787 (sweep 765) and recorded "cB, strong nebulosity of an irregular square figure.  Seems to contain faint large stars, about 3' l and 2 1/2' broad."  Two nights later (sweep 768) he noted "the stars which are visible in it, do not seem to belong to it."  On sweep 211, JH logged "L; E; r; has an appearance of two nuclei or points of greatest condensation; it touches a fine double star [h1606 = 9.3/10.2 at 18"]."  R.J. Mitchell, LdR's assistant on 19 Aug 1855, recorded "seen as in sketch [PT 1861, pl XXX, fig 37].  3 st in it, F neby reaches nearly up to the star sf; B knots in it, the nf one seems triangular in shape and sometimes I thought it split up by a dark line from sf to np."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported "irregular ring structure indicated; the dimensions are 86"x69" in p.a. 20°.  The two brightest patches are at the north.. three stars lie in roughly circular gaps in the nebulosity..."


In a 2001 issue of Amateur Astronomy magazine, Eric Honeycutt called NGC 7008 the "Fetus Nebula" due to its appearance in his 22-inch telescope.

NGC 7009 = PK 37-34.1 = PN G037.7-34.5 = Saturn Nebula

21 04 10.7 -11 21 49; Aqr

V = 7.8;  Size 30"x26"


48" (10/29/16): the remarkable Saturn Nebula was viewed at 1084x.  The intense, inner "ring" is very elongated (~25"x10") with an unusual warped appearance.  The inner ring is brighter on the west end.  The rounder shell extends ~30"x25", slightly elongated WSW-ENE and contains an obvious "knot" on the north side of the shell.  The ansae ("handles" at the end of the jets) varied in size and orientation, with the western ansae larger, brighter and angled outward on the north end.  The central star was easily visible.


48" (10/24/14): at 610x; the western ansae or "handle" at the end of the jet appeared as a small, narrow bar, roughly perpendicular to the extension, but slightly tilted, so the north end was pointing outward (west).  The eastern ansae was much smaller but with careful viewing was slightly elongated and tilted in a mirrored orientation.  Also, a very small, low contrast knot was noted on the north end of the outer shell.  Otherwise, the details mentioned in the observation from last November were all noted.


48" (11/1/13): the double-shell structure was fascinating at 813x. The bright, inner ring was surprisingly elongated WSW-ENE, ~30"x10", with an irregular surface brightness and uneven thickness.  The inner darker hole was also elongated, extending nearly the length of the nebula and was punctuated by a fairly easy central star.  This annulus is encased in a rounder, outer shell, ~30"x25" diameter, with a slightly irregular rim (brighter at the north edge).  Extending from the main body were the two easily visible "jets" extending WSW-ENE with prominent "ansae" (handles) at each tip [separation 44"] with the western tip slightly brighter.  The color was generally greenish, though the outer halo had a salmon-colored tinge.


24" (7/25/14): viewed at 1000x in good seeing at Lassen National Park (elevation 8200 ft).  The intense, inner annulus is 30"x18" with a bright, moderately thick green rim and darker center.  The central star was nearly visible steadily within the darker center.  The oval annulus was slightly irregular in surface brightness.  It was surrounded by a rounder, fainter envelope, which varied slightly in brightness, particularly on the north side, which contained a noticeable knot.  The fairly narrow jets were readily visible, though brighter on the west side.  An obvious knot ("ansa") that was slightly elongated was visible at the tip of the western jet.  The eastern extension only had a weak brightening at the tip.


18" (7/28/03): Viewed at 1087x in very good seeing.  The 30" brighter inner oval is elongated WSW-ENE and has a noticeable irregular surface brightness (first time this was noted) with a brighter, thick rim and darker center (partially annular).  Surrounding the high surface oval is a fainter, outer shell although interestingly, the transition appeared more gradual than at lower power.  The extensions or jets were easily visible with very small knots ("ansae") occasionally visible at the tips.


17.5" (8/10/91): extremely bright, fairly small, very high surface brightness, blue-green color, about 30" diameter to the main oval body.  At 412x, the two famous extensions or "jets" are easily visible extending WSW-ENE from the oval disc using direct vision.  The western extension is brighter and a very small knot (ansae) is visible at moments with concentration at the tip of the west extension. A faint outer shell surrounds the bright disc.  Numerous additional observations made since 9/14/85.


13.1" (9/3/83): similar view to 17.5", but the eastern extension was more difficult to view.


8" (10/13/81): bright, small, blue-green, high surface brightness.  Rays extending outward are suspected, particularly on the western side in excellent seeing at 200x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7009 = H IV-1 on 7 Sep 1782, over a year before he began his sweeps, while still reviewing naed-eye stars and discovering double stars. This was Herschel's first documented deep sky discovery (Wolfgang Steinicke found an unpublished discovery of NGC 6535 on 24 Aug 1780 while he inspected the Flamsteed stars).  It was found with either his 6.2-inch or his 12-inch f/20 reflector ("small 20-foot") built in 1776 to survey the Messier objects. He described "a curious nebula, or what else to call it I do not know. It is of a shape somewhat oval, nearly circular, and with this power [460] appears to be about 10 or 15" diameter.  It is of the same shape with 278 but much less in appearance.  With 932 it is still the same shape but much larger.  So that its appearance seems to follow the law of magnifying, from whence it is clear that it is of some real magnitude in the heavens and not a glare of light.  The brightness in all the powers does not differ so much as if it were of a planetary nature but seems to be of the starry kind, tho' no star is visible with any power.  It is all over of nearly the same brightness.  The compound eyepiece will not distinguish it from a fixt star, at least not sensibly...".  He observed the planetary during 6 sweeps with his 18.7" and on 2 Aug 1788 (sweep 851) logged, "The planetary nebula, considerably oval, in the direction of the parallel nearly.  Of a bluish light, but not very well defined."


Wilhelm Struve independently found NGC 7009 (∑ 8) in 1825 or 1826 with the 9.6-inch Great Dorpat refractor.  It was included in his list of 9 "Nebulae dectae" in an appendix to his main catalogue of double stars. Auwers and d'Arrest measured accurate positions.  Lord Rosse, Romney Robinson and George Johnstone Stoney observed the planetary on 23 Oct 1848 resulting in a sketch (by Stoney) and description, "we have not detected any perforation, but it has ansae, which probably indicate a surrounding nebulous ring seen edgeways".


Stoney or Rosse made another observation on 16 Aug 1849 and measured the "position of ring taken with an eyepiece furnished with a level and a position circle.  Inclination of ring to horizon 9°."  Although the nickname "Saturn Nebula" was not mentioned in Robinson's report to the Royal Irish Academy, the description in the 1880 publication (given as 16 Sep 1849) states, "Saturn neb. Pos of ring 81 deg".


Using a 9.5" refractor in 1856, Father Secchi sketched NGC 7009 and noted the nebula was fainter at the ends of the major axis and brighter along the north and south sides (AN 43, 157).


In 1867 Lassell reported his "Observations with the Four-foot Equatoreal at Malta" and his description from 23 Aug 1862 begins "My first impression of this Nebula was that it was a sky-blue likeness of Saturn".  In a letter dated 26 Sep 1862, he goes into much more detail:  In directing my large equatoreal upon the well-known planetary nebula situated in AR 20h 56m N.P.D. 101° 56' (1862), it has revealed so marvellous a conformation of this object that I cannot forbear to send you a drawing of it [see www.docdb.net/history/texts/display.php?article=1863rsps___12__269l], with some description of its appearance. With comparatively low powers, e.g. 231and 285, it appears at first sight as a vividly light-blue elliptic nebula, with a slight prolongation of the nebula, or a very faint star, at or near the ends of the transverse axis. In this aspect the nebula resembles in form the planet Saturn when the ring is seen nearly edgewise. Attentively viewing it with higher powers, magnifying respectively 760, 1060, and 1480 times, and under the most favourable circumstances which have presented themselves, I have discovered within the nebula a brilliant elliptic ring, extremely well defined, and apparently having no connexion with the surrounding nebula, which indeed has the appearance of a gaseous or gauze-like envelope, scarcely interfering with the sharpness of the ring, and only diminishing somewhat its brightness. This nebulous envelope extends a little further from the ends of the conjugate than from the ends of the transverse axis; indeed, it is but very faintly prolonged, and only just traceable towards the preceding and following stars....


Lassell's sketch shows the two ansae or handles as faint stars but the outer halo does not extend as far as the ansae. Hermann Vogel produced an excellent sketch on 20 Sep 1883 using the 27" refractor at Vienna.  Besides the prominent inner elliptical ring and an oval darker central hole, the outer halo extends ENE-WSW and tapers on the ends with a star-like knot on the WSW end.

17.5" (7/1/89): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, weakly concentrated.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7010 = h2100 on 6 Aug 1823 (sweep 48).  This galaxy was the first deep sky object Herschel discovered during his early "practice" sweeps.  He recorded it as "a round, excessively faint nebula, 1' in diameter, resolvable, scarcely (?) perceptible, bM, found in looking vainly for M72."


His practice sweep, along with 6 others in May to September of 1823, were mislaid and later found after he started numbering his sweeps.  For completeness, he sequenced these initial sweeps as numbers 43 to 49.  His position for NGC 7010 was 10' too far south but Herbert Howe measured an accurate position at the turn of the century.  Herschel's first astronomical notebook entries date back to Nov 1816 and include some double stars as well as M31, M32 and M36.


Harold Corwin writes that Guillaume Bigourdan misidentified NGC 7010 with a star and rediscovered the galaxy (at the correct position).  Dreyer didn't realize the equivalence, so NGC 7010 was catalogued again as IC 5082.  MCG (-02-53-024) labels this galaxy as IC 5082.

NGC 7011

21 01 49.7 +47 21 15; Cyg


17.5" (9/23/95): at the NGC position are just some scattered faint stars near a mag 9.5 star located at 21 01 52 +47 24.9.  These do not appear to be worth noting at all by John Herschel.  About 15' NE, though, is a fairly bright scattered group located to the southeast of mag 7.5 SAO 50376.  This group is about 5' in length and elongated NW-SE.  Near the center is the brightest star (mag 10) at 21 02 34 +47 32.7.  Also of interest is the Milky Way, which abruptly begins off the southeast side of the low power field and is magnificent to sweep around in this region.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7011 = h2101 on 19 Sep 1829 and simply noted "A cluster.  No further description."  There are only weak concentrations near his position and Karl Reinmuth concludes "no cluster", based on a Heidelberg plate.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.


A small group of 8 mag 13-14 stars in a 3' region lies 2' north of JH's position, and Harold Corwin lists this asterism as the most likely candidate.  But I didn't feel it stood out visually.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 429x): brightest galaxy in the core of ACO S921.  I quickly took notes on 10 galaxies within a 10' circle including four small companions of NGC 7012 within 2'!  NGC 7012 appeared fairly bright, moderately large, round, 50" diameter, well concentrated with a small bright core.  The brightest nearby companion is ESO-LV 2860520 situated 1.3' SE but two fainter, very small companions (not included in Megastar) are just off the east and NE edge of the halo.  ESO 286-048, a nice edge-on, lies 3.4' NW.  A mag 12 star lies 1' SW and a mag 15 star is 27" SE of center.  The cluster is centered roughly 14' NE of mag 6.9 HD 200554.  The following are some of the nearby galaxies.


Anon J2106481-444853

Situated just 32" NE of the center of NGC 7012 in a tight group of 5 galaxies within 2'.  Appeared as a very faint knot, round, 10" diameter.  LCRS B210329.4-450104, a similar faint knot, is just 25" SE.  There is no listing for this galaxy in NED, HyperLeda or SIMBAD.


LCRS B210329.4-450104

Situated just 40" E of the center of NGC 7012.  Appeared as a very faint knot, round, 10" diameter with a similar galaxy (uncatalogued) 25" NW.  A very faint star is just off the SW edge, 17" from center, sandwiched between this galaxy and NGC 7012.


ESO-LV 2860520 = 2MASX J21065143-4449340 = PGC 66118

This galaxy is situated 1.3' SE of NGC 7012.  It appeared fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter, small brighter core.  2MASX J21065660-4449137 lies 1' NE.

Size 18'x18'


18" (7/24/06): viewed at 160x, this detailed reflection nebula displayed a great deal of interesting structure!  Surrounding the mag 7.4 illuminating star HD 200775 (pre-main-sequence Herbig Be star) is a bright halo of nebulosity extending mostly north of the star and ending just south of the star in a well-defined slightly curving border.  A wide absorption lane cuts into the nebulosity from the southwest towards the bright star.  To the south of the star is a triangular region of haze (brightest just south of the central star) roughly filling in the region defined by a mag 13.5 star 5.5' SSE and a fainter star a similar distance southwest.  A larger section of faint haze extending N-S is seemingly detached at the periphery on the east side of the nebula (this is an outer "wing" on photographs) and a more vaguely defined region of low surface brightness haze is detached on the western side (also oriented N-S).  These two detached wings give a diameter of at least 7'.


17.5" (8/13/88): very prominent unusual nebulosity surrounding mag 7.4 SAO 19158.  A dark lane oriented SSW-NNE is following the bright star.  Nebulosity may extend to a star 3' SSE that also has a halo.


13.1" (9/22/84): the dark lane appears to be following the central star and oriented ~N-S.


13.1" (9/11/82): bright, large nebulosity surrounding a mag 7 star.  There is a sharp light cut-off on the east side near the bright star, although nebulosity extends beyond.


8" (8/28/81): nebulosity extends south of the mag 7.5 star with averted vision using 100-125x. A very faint star is at the south edge.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7023 = H IV-74 on 18 Oct 1794 (sweep 1063) and recorded "7m.  A star very much affected with nebulosity that more than fills the field, it seemed to extend to at least a degree all round; small stars such as 9 or 10m of which there are a great number, are perfectly free from this appearance, but everything about the telescope being very damp, I have suspicion of a deception."  Per Collinder mistakenly equated a cluster (Cr 429) with NGC 7023.  Cr 427 is a very faint cluster close west, though Archinal and Hynes noted "His position for Cr 429 fall precisely on the actual location for the real cluster here, Cr 427.  And Collinder's position for the real cluster falls 1 minute to the west of it on comparitively empty sky."


In 1907 Max Wolf photographed the nebula with the 28" reflector of the Konigstuhl Observatory and found the nebula was encircled by a lacuna or ring 0.5° in diameter, which is "absolutely empty of faint stars" [dubbed a "Hohlennebel" or "cave-nebula"] .  He noted "In spite of the small field of the reflector-plate, there was evidence that the cavity was the end of a channel entering the picture almost exactly from the south...The nebula itself is a very remarkable object.  In many respects it resembles in form the Pi2 Cygni nebula [IC 5146 = Cocoon Nebula]."  The surrounding void was first photographed by Dr. Roberts.  The reflection nebula vdB 152, also in Cepheus, is another example.

There is also a looser group of stars attached to the NE extending the diameter to 15'.  The group on the NE side appears part of the same stream and includes several mag 11 stars.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7024 = H VIII-57 = h2103 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 612) and recorded "A cluster of coarsely scattered pS stars of several sizes, not rich."  On 1 Oct 1828 (sweep 183), JH logged "A loose struggling coarse cl.  Stars 10...11m, place that of 3 *s 10m in a triangle in the closest part.  Several st precede the cl, which seems to be an outlier of the second branch of the Milky Way."

18" (9/10/07): at 565x the "Cheeseburger Nebula' was easily resolved into two small, elongated knots oriented ~E-W and with both lobes slightly extended ~N-S.  Both knots are lively or mottled and slightly tapered in shape.  They both contain stellar or quasi-stellar points near their centers with the western nucleus slightly easier.  The eastern lobe is barely larger and brighter.  The lobes are nearly tangent [6" apart between centers] but just separated by a darker lane and both lobes are encased in a common halo.  At 807x, the two lobes were clearly separated by a dark lane (the Cheeseburger's "patty"!) oriented SSW to NNE.  A central star was not seen. A mag 10.5 star is off the NE side, less than 30" from the center.  Located 13' NNW of mag 4.6 73 Cyg.


17.5" (7/9/99): fascinating object at 380x both with and without a UHC filter.  The double-lobed structure is clearly visible with the western lobe slightly elongated N-S and containing a brighter center.  The eastern knot also has a quasi-stellar center at moments using direct vision and the knot has an irregular outline.  Using the UHC, the lobes are more cleanly separated and the small fainter halo that encases the two bright lobes is more obvious.  A mag 11 star is just 0.5' NE of center.  Located 12.5' NNW of mag 4.7 63 Cygni.


13" (9/3/83): at 333x appears fairly bright, very small, elongated WSW-ENE.  Two brighter condensations at the opposite ends are possibly barely detached at the center.  Forms a double at low power with a comparable mag 11 star 27" NE of center.


Sherburne Burnham discovered NGC 7026 on 6 Jul 1873 with his personal 6-inch Clark refractor at his home in Chicago (Memoirs of the RAS, Vol 44, p295).  It was described in his "Third Catalogue of Double Stars (1873) as "a very remarkable and curious double, or elongated planetary (?) nebula.  It is close to a 9.3m star.  This may have been noted before, but it is not in Herschel's General Catalogue, or Lassell's Catalogue of New Nebulae."  It was also included in his 1879 "Double Star Observations made in 1877-8 at Chicago with the 18 1/2-inch Refractor of the Dearborn Observatory, comprising: I. A Catalogue of 251 New Double Stars with Measures; II. Micrometrical Measures of 500 Double Stars."  He noted the "distance between nuclei as 2.57".  Dreyer missed Burnham's two discovery notes, so NGC 7026 wasn't added to the General Catalog Supplement.


Ralph Copeland independently found this planetary on 18 Nov 1880 using a visual spectroscopic sweep and announced "a new planetary nebula has been found by Dr. Copeland at Dunecht, using Prof. Pickering's method of search."  Burnham caught Copeland's "discovery" note and claimed priority in another 1881 article ("The planetary nebula in Cygnus").  Burnham later studied NGC 7026 with the 36" Lick refractor.


In 1909, Rev. Thomas Espin wrote (1909MNRAS..70..184E), "This autumn I have observed the nebula on several occasions.  It consists of two elongated masses running N and small, each of which has a nucleus.  To my eye the preceding nucleus is slightly brighter, and I have estimated them as 11.2, 11.4 mag, respectively.  On Nov. 15 it seemed to me that the south part of the nebula ends more abruptly than the north.  On the same night a faint star was suspected at the south end, and attempts were made to measure it.  On all occasions the space between the two masses has seemed filled with nebulosity, and the object has appeared as one nebula with two nuclei."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported "very irregular; there are two bright lobes 5" long in the shorter exposures symmetrically placed with regard to the central star, and about 6" apart from center to center.  A bright of nebulosity connects these and involves the central star, so that it resembles the letter H.  Irregular wisps extend from each end of this formation, making the total length about 25" in p.a. about 10°.


Jay McNeil coined the nickname "Cheeseburger Nebula" in 1994 with a 10" f/5 Cave reflector.  "It very much so reminded me of a small, nebulous hamburger with two perfectly shaped "buns" separated by a long thin dark lane (the meat ;-)."

V = 8.5;  Size 18"x11"


48" (10/24/14): this fairly small, ultra-high surface brightness green planetary was observed at 610x.  Overall, the object extends ~18"x12" NW-SE, but split up into three distinct components.  The first and brightest component is an elongated glow (~10"x6" NW-SE) on the northwest side, which contains a very small, intensely bright knot at its western edge!  The second bright component is adjacent to its east and is separated by a thin, darker lane. This section has an elongated, irregular outline (~10"x6" NW-SE), and is slightly mottled with brighter spots.  A thin, high-contrast dark lane runs WSW-ENE at the south edge of these two sections. The third bright component, just southeast of this lane, appeared as an irregular, elongated bar, running 2:1 WSW-ENE, ~12"x6" and formed a "cap" on the southeast side.  The two ends of this cap are very slightly curved (concave to the northwest).


18" (9/10/07): at 175x; appears as a small, very high surface brightness oval with a blue-green color.  At 450x, this planetary is elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~18"x12" and has an unusual bipolar appearance with two lobes.  The 10" NW component has a very high surface brightness and contains a quasi-stellar brighter knot on its west edge.  A fainter lobe juts out towards the SE and is slightly smaller (~8").  At 565x the SE lobe seems incomplete as if it was partially obscured and the two lobes are encased in a thin outer envelope.  The view was fascinating at 807x with the sense of peering at a 3-dimensional object - the brighter NW lobe being closer and the partially overlapped SE lobe extending away in space.  At this power both lobes were clearly irregular in shape and surface brightness.


17.5" (10/2/99): At 100x, the small greenish disc is very prominent but at higher powers appears bluish.  Easily takes very high power and the view unfiltered at 380x and 500x was striking.  Appears elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.3'x0.2', with two distinct lobes.  The NW knot is slightly brighter and at times a stellar spot or star appears embedded at its SW tip.  At 500x, the two knots are encased in a very small common halo that extends further out on the north side.  The southern edge of both knots has a sharp, flat appearance.


13" (9/11/82): at 288x; small, bright, unusually high surface brightness, elongated NW-SE.  There are two distinct overlapping nuclei and a narrow dark lane possibly separates these two condensations.


80mm (9/10/07): visible as a mag 8.5-9 "star" at 12.5x in the 80mm finder and easily identified using an OIII blink.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7027 = St IX-27 in the fall of 1878 with the 31-inch Foucault reflector at Marseille. This planetary is probably the brightest object he discovered.  From some reason it was not included in Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions.


The following observational history is from Wolfgang Steinicke.  The Reverend Thomas Webb independently rediscovered NGC 7027 on 14 Nov 1879 using a 9-inch reflector.  He described it as an "object like a bluish 9 mag star, not quite of stellar character - a small pair, too close to be separated?"  At higher magnifications it was seen as "bright, very ill-defined, nebulous disk of about 4" diameter, surrounded probably by a little glow, and much resembling the planet Uranus."  Webb's announcement in several publications created a flurry of interest in late 1879 with spectroscopic observations by Knott, Copeland, Winnecke, Vogel.  In 1880, Dreyer noted Stephan's prior discovery, though it was still commonly assumed that Webb was the discoverer.  E.E. Barnard observed NGC 7027 in June of 1889 with the Lick 36-inch at 500x (with Burnham) and logged, "In the p part there is a small bluish -green star like object - shining through ? haze.  Occasionally a darkish space separates the condensations into two."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported "the condensations are not stellar in the shortest exposures.  Quite irregular and roughly trinuclear, though the southern condsation is apparently two masses close together.  The southern condensation and the brighter at the north are 7.5" apart in p.a. 135°."

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7028 = m 434 on 17 Sep 1863 and noted "vF, S, vlE."  Near his position are only stars and its possible he mistook some close pair of stars as a nebula, though the observation is marked as verified.  Harold Corwin found no systematic offset on the sweep that would point to a specific star(s).  Two possible candidates are UGC 11676 = CGCG 448-039 (mentioned by Corwin), which lies 2.4 minutes of RA to the west or CGCG 449-005, which lies 17' south.  Neither of these objects, though, are at a simple digit (clerical) offset, so would be simply guesses.  See Corwin's notes for more (unlikely) candidates.

17.5" (8/2/97): brightest in a small group of galaxies - this object was quickly noticed to be double at 220x oriented WNW-ESE.  The very close components are just resolved, round, ~20" diameter each and very similar in brightness.  Several faint galaxies are in the field to the east including ESO 530-018, MCG +05-50-004 and ESO 530-020 (resolved triple galaxy).


ESO 530-018 is an extremely faint and small object in the NGC 7035 group. Located 8' ESE of NGC 7035 and 4' W of the ESO 530-020 triplet. It required concentration and extended viewing to glimpse this threshold object close (NE) of a mag 15 star.  Confusing the observation further is a second threshold galaxy (MCG +05-50-004) that was also glimpsed on a couple of occasions close southeast of the star.


MCG -04-50-007 is the middle in a close trio oriented SW to NE.  Although appearing very faint and small, this member is the largest and brightest of the trio (ESO 530-020), seems to have a brighter core and is slightly elongated ~SW-NE.  MCG -04-50-006 is the furthest southwest and appears extremely faint, very small, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, but direction uncertain due to faintness. MCG -04-50-008 is the northeast member of the chain and appeared extremely faint, very small, round.  This galaxy is close SE [40"] of a mag 13 star and is just cleanly resolved from MCG -04-50-007 to the southwest.  The trio is situated 4' S of a striking double star h5251 = 8.5/8.7 at 9".


Frank Muller discovered NGC 7035 = LM 2-460 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  His rough position (nearest minute of RA) is 21h 11m -23d 05' and he only noted "iR" with a size of 0.5'.  ESO/Uppsala and Harold Corwin identify ESO 530-015 as NGC 7035 as the most likely candidate.  This is a close pair of interacting galaxies about 3' south and 34 second of RA west of Muller's position.  Corwin's Southern Galaxy Catalogue has listings for both components, identified as NGC 7035a and NGC 7035b.


The RNGC identifies either edge-on ESO 530-018 or nearby MCG -04-50-004 as NGC 7035.  This pair lies 5' to 6' south of Muller's position, though happen to match in RA.  As the Leander McCormick positions tend to be fairly accurate in declination, this identification is less likely.  It is also possible that NGC 7035 refers to a close chain of three galaxies 4' east of the edge-on, though Muller would have probably resolved this trio.  There are a number of galaxies in the area, roughly matching Muller's declination, so if he was too far west in RA then there are several additional candidates!

17.5" (10/21/95): very poor scattered asterism of 10 mag 11-13 stars in a 4' diameter.  This is totally unimpressive group and surprising it would be noted by John Herschel.  Most of the stars form an oval outline highlighted by a tighter group of four stars within 1' diameter at the south end of the oval.  There are no stars within the asterism's outline.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7036 = h2104 on 11 Oct 1825 and noted "A scattered cluster of small stars."  A scattered group of stars is centered about 5' south of JH's position, and this is likely the intended object.

Consists of about 50 stars mag 11-14.5 with the brightest two mag 11/11.5 stars near the center at 50" separation.  The region northeast of this pair is fairly rich in mag 13 stars.  Appears best at 100x where it is detached in the field.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7037 = h2106 on 5 Aug 1829 and recorded "a cluster, not very rich; irreg figure, 8' l, 5' br; stars 11...15m."  His position is very close to the brightest star (11th magnitude) near the center of this group.  At Birr Castle in 1876, Sir Robert Ball called it "Many st, but no remarkable cl."  Based on its photographic appearance at Heidelberg, Karl Reinmuth noted "Cl, pS, E, pP, st pF."  Though this group of stars may be an asterism, it stands out clearly on the DSS and the RNGC misclassifies it as nonexistent.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7045 = h2108 on 16 Jul 1827 and logged "eF; field feebly illuminated by moonlight, but I remained satisfied of its reality."  His position lies between mag 9.3 SAO 126648 and mag 9.6 SAO 126646 (10' south-southwest) and falls close to a 8" pair of faint stars (one is a blended double).  Heinrich d'Arrest was unsuccessful in finding h2108 at Copenhagen in 1864 and Rudolph Spitaler at Vienna reported NGC 7045 "is not a nebula, but only a couple of vF stars close together."  Harold Corwin also identifies NGC 7045 as this double star (see his identification notes).


RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent, although the "New Description" appears to describe a galaxy.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7048 = St IX-28 on 19 Oct 1878.  His micrometric position is very accurate.  At +46° declination, NGC 7048 is the most northerly object discovered by Stephan at Marseilles as he only searched up to the zenith.


In 1919, Heber Curtis reported it was undoubtedly a planetary nebula based on a Crossley photograph and described it as "A rather faint oval, with slight traces of ring structure. It is about 60" x 50" in p.a. 20°±. The brightest portions are at the east end of the minor axis. There is a very faint central star."  In 1920, Francis Pease reported it was "a planetary resembling the Dumb-bell nebula, about 1' diameter, weak axis in p.a. 170°.  The central star is very faint."

17.5" (8/25/95): this interesting asterism consists of three distinct groups of stars each about 4' apart from the other two groups.  The south group has five stars including the brightest mag 10 star.  The west group has four stars in a small clump with a detached wide pair a couple of arc minutes south.  Finally, the richest group is on the east side with 15 stars mag 12.5-15 in a 2' circle.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7050 = h2111 on 19 Aug 1828, though apparently didn't take any notes.  The Slough Catalogue reports "No description.  A cluster."  His position falls near the brightest mag 12 star in one of the northeast subgroup in my visual description.  Ld Rosse: " About a dozen B stars and a number of S ones scattered about."  On 5 Oct 1866, Sir Robert Ball logged at Birr Castle, "about a dozen B stars and a number of S stars scattered about it."  RNGC classifies this asterism as nonexistent, though it is pretty clearly JH's intended object.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7051 = h2113 on 30 Jul 1827 and recorded "vF; R; gbM; near a double star."  There is nothing at his position and it was not found on 3 attempts at Birr Castle. On a 4th try (a bad night), a nebula was suspected near a faint double star but not confirmed.  Exactly two minutes of time west of JH's position is MCG -02-54-004 = PGC 66566 and it is preceded by an unequal double star.  Heinrich d'Arrest followed up at Copenhagen (based on the failure at Birr Castle) and measured an accurate position on 26 Aug 1864 and later noted the two minute discrepancy with Herschel's RA.  Dreyer used d'Arrest's corrected position in the NGC.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7054 = St IV-4 on 31 August 1872. There is nothing at Stephan's position and there is no specific listing for NGC 7054 in Emmanuel Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions.  But Corwin noticed an "anonymous" object in Esmiol's table is listed with Stephan's original offset but from a different star.  This leads to a position near NGC 7080 (discovered earlier by Marth).  But apparently Esmiol, like Stephan, misidentified the offset star as PPM 113035 is exactly at Stephan's offset from NGC 7080.  NGC 7080 is listed independently in Esmiol's table based on an observation on 17 Aug 1873, so apparently Stephan revisited the field a year later, but this time the offset star was correctly identified.

17.5" (8/25/95): this is a small, unimpressive group of just 10 mag 12-14.5 stars in a 3' region.  The group is only distinguishable because it is detached in the field.  There are some brighter scattered stars to the south, which John Herschel may have included in his 8' estimate.  The group of stars appears to be fully resolved and just an asterism.  Interestingly, there is a large, fairly bright and rich star field about 30' SW centered about 21 16.5 +57 28" (2000) which appears to be a cluster but is not listed in the Lynga catalogue.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7055 = h2114 on 25 Sep 1829 and recorded "a F, S, poor cluster, 8' dia."  His position corresponds with a very small group of 10 faint stars.

There are roughly two dozen stars mag 13-14.5 in the immediate vicinity but the density of the fainter stars is actually lower than other rich regions in the same low power field.  So, only distinguishable because of the grouping of brighter stars which may form a physical group.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7058 = h2115 on 8 Sep 1829 and simply noted "the chief star of a coarse, poor cl."

Copeland, observing at Birr Castle in 1871, noted it was a "Cl, vP, in milky way." and Reinmuth called it simply "a few B st", based on a Heidelberg plate.  RNGC classifies this Milky Way asterism as nonexistent (Type 7) and Kharchenko et al, 2012, classifies it as a moving group so at least some of the stars may be related.

17.5" (9/15/90): fairly faint, extremely small, round, bright stellar nucleus or star superimposed, just non-stellar (only core visible).  Located 4.7' WSW of mag 8.8 SAO 45403 and 10.3' W of mag 7.6 SAO 45409.  Forms a pair with NGC 7065A 4.2' ESE.


The companion appeared very faint, fairly small, weak concentration, very low surface brightness diffuse glow.  Collinear with mag 8.8 SAO 145403 2.7' N and a mag 11 star 6.0' N.  Also a mag 11 star is 3.1' E and mag 7.6 SAO 45409 is 6.3' E!  Close to the mag 11 star that follows are two fainter mag 13 and 14 stars.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7065 = St VIII-12 (first list) on 24 and 25 Aug 1865 and his discovery positions match MCG -01-54-017 = PGC 66766.  Stephan independently discovered MCG -01-54-017 on 22 Sep 1876.  His micrometric position is very accurate.  Albert Marth first observed the field on 3 Aug 1864 and noted "eF, irr R." for m 440.  But Marth's position matches MCG -01-54-018 = PGC 66774, which is often identified as NGC 7065A.  Dreyer assumed d'Arrest's object was the same as Marth's and used d'Arrest's micrometric position in the NGC (Stephan was not credited).  He noted in the description, though, that Marth's RA was 13 seconds larger.  For comparison, here are the positions for 2000:


21 26 42.4 -06 59 43  NGC 7065 = MCG -01-54-017 = PGC 66766

21 26 45.7 -06 59 41  d'Arrest (mean of 2 positions)

21 26 43.3 -06 59 46  Stephan

21 26 42.9 -06 59 48  Esmiol's re-reduction


21 26 57.8 -07 01 18  NGC 7065A = MCG -01-54-018 = PGC 66774

21 26 58 -07 02     Marth


So, while d'Arrest and Stephan discovered NGC 7065, Marth apparently discovered NGC 7065A, a larger, lower surface brightness companion 4' southeast.  Interestingly, all three observers only found a single galaxy, though both MCG galaxies were observed in my 17.5" and fairly similar in ease of visibility.  So, NGC 7065A should have received a separate NGC number -- unless Marth's position was very poor, and coincidentally matches NGC 7065A.  The RNGC positions for both galaxies are 2' too far south (see my RNGC Corrections #4).  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.

18" (10/8/05): this "nonexistent cluster" is located in a glorious low power Milky Way field.  Several groupings (both large and small) caught my eye at 73x (67' field), but I was mostly drawn to a fairly distinctive 4' string of stars oriented NW-SE.  At 225x, ~15 stars were packed into the string, most stars being mag 13-14 with a few fainter stars, and possibly over unresolved Milky Way background glow.  This group would have likely caught John Herschel's eye as he swept the region, though it may be an asterism (not in Lynga).


John Herschel discovered NGC 7071 = h2119 on 19 Sep 1829 and recorded "A very poor and small cluster of an oblong figure.  It is followed by a loosely scattered mass of stars."  His position corresponds with a 7' to 8' curving string of stars.  Surprising, Karl Reinmuth was unable to identify this group on a Heidelberg plate and noted "not found; = N7067?"  Dorothy Carlson repeated this comment in her 1940 NGC Correction paper as well as in the RNGC.

Viewed unfiltered at 160x and a couple of faint stars are embedded, one at the east edge and another at the north.  Only a weak contrast gain using the OIII filter and easier to view unfiltered at 225x.  At this power the shape appears irregular and brighter along the east side.  Neither of the two stars appears to be the central star as they're situated near the edge of the halo.  A number of 13-15th magnitude stars are in the field including a couple of 14th mag stars 1' and 2' N and a small, fainter trio close west.  Located 56' ENE of mag 2.5 Alpha Cephei (Alderamin).

William Herschel made an early observation using his 6-inch (10-ft focal length) on 31 May 1783 and commented, "all fairly resolved into stars."  On 19 Oct 1784, he described "a beautiful cl. of v compressed and numerous stars, the most compressed part about 2' dia, the next about 7 or 8'; and all the stars within about 15' seem still to belong to the same by the colour, the size, the regular scattering and the gradual accumulation.  The general figure is round; but within the space of 6 or 7' the stars are arranged in a sort of a square."


John Herschel reported "vB; vL; irreg. R; g b and v s m b M.

NGC 7088 = Ced 193 = Baxendell's Unphotographable Nebula

21 33 24 -00 23; Aqr


= Not found, Corwin and RNGC.


Joseph Baxendell discovered NGC 7088 on 28 Sept 1880 using a 6" refractor at his private observatory in Birkdale, England.  The discovery was announced in "A New Nebula", MNRAS 41, 48 (1880).  The following history is from Wolfgang Steinicke.


Baxendell contributed only one object to the NGC.  He published the discovery of a large faint nebula near M2 in Aquarius and described it being of "irregular oval form, its longer axis lying in a nearly east and west direction".  It is 30' north of M2 and has a size of 75' x 52'. He writes "It seems to be similar in character to the large nebula near the Pleiades [found by Tempel], but is slightly less bright. I have, however, seen it on several nights, and have no doubt of its existence."  But, its existence is the very problem!


NGC 7088 was seen visually by several observers, such as Dreyer in 1885 with a 10" refractor (mentioned in the notes section of the NGC), Bigourdan (1897, 12" refractor), Hagen (1915 and 1917, 16" refractor), Wolf (1927, 6" refractor), O'Connor (1929, 15" refractor), Becker (1930, 12" refractor) and Lehner (1930, 4" refractor). The crucial thing is that, apart from these sightings, the object could never be photographed (and was nicknamed "Baxendell's Unphotographable Nebula"). Many attempts were made (Wolf, Baade, Shapley, Strohmeier, Gürtler, Helwan), using different emulsions and filters, but the result was always negative. The modern conclusion is: The object is not real and all visual observations are due to physiological delusions, maybe caused by reflections of the nearby bright cluster M 2. This is supported by sightings of O'Connor, reporting two other, and ever larger nebulae near M2, which are nonexistent too! The same might be true for the obscure "Hagen clouds".  See Harold Corwin's discussion, including Stephen Waldee's comments, for more on this object.

V = 6.6;  Size 16';  Surf Br = 0.2


48" (10/26/11): hundreds of relatively bright stars resolved in this large, beautifully symmetric globular.  The intensely bright core is overlaid with a mat of resolved stars.


18" (7/17/07): overfills the 8' field at 393x with resolved stars from edge to edge.  M2 contains a very bright 3' core that increases to a very intense 1' nucleus.  The halo is very symmetric and thins out fairly evenly.  A few hundred stars were resolved in the cluster with the central region extremely densely packed.


17.5" (8/2/86): over 100 stars resolved over the entire disc at 286x.  Superb view at this magnification.


13" (7/16/82): high resolution at edges, partially resolved core, symmetrical halo.


8" (10/4/80): intense core, faint halo.  Faint stars are resolved in the outer halo.


Jean-Dominique Maraldi discovered M2 = NGC 7089 = h2125 on 11 Sept 1746 at the Paris Observatory while tracking Comet de Chéseaux of 1746.  Charles Messier made an independent discovery on 11 Sep 1760.  William Herschel observed the globular on 31 Jul 1783 with his 12-inch (small 20-foot) and commented "I can count 18 or 20 of the stars."  Using his 18.7" on 12 Aug 1785 (sweep 425), he recorded "an extremely rich, very compressed and very brilliant cluster of extremely small stars, 7 or 8' in diameter.  The stars are plainly to be seen, especially on the borders where they are not so condensed."  On 4 Sep 1799 he observed M2 with the 48-inch (40-foot), and logged "It appeared very brilliant and luminous.  The scattered stars were brought to a good, well determined focus, for which it appears that the central condensed light is owing to a multitude of stars that appeared at various distances behind and near each other.  I could actually see and distinguish the stars even in the central mass.  The Rev. Mr. Vince, Plumian Profession or Astronomy at Cambridge, saw it in the same telescope as described."


On 12 Sep 1830 (sweep 288), JH reported "A most superb cluster; round; stars eS; 12, 13, 14m; they are evidently globularly arranged, and not internally condensed towards the centre more than the spherical form would make them appear to be; but in the middle they blend into a blaze of light. It is like a heap of fine sand!  With 9 inches aperture I can just see the stars; with 6 it is resolvable."

25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): at 244x; bright, very large irregular edge-on ~7:1 NW-SE, ~5'x0.7'.  Overall the galaxy has a striking patchy appearance with an irregular surface brightness (somewhat similar to NGC 253).  It contains a very elongated, sightly brighter core region with a mag 14 star superimposed just southeast of the core.  The entire northern flank of the galaxy is very uneven or patchy due to dust patches or a dust lane.  The surface brightness of the galaxy drops significantly as it extends southeast of the star for ~2'.  The northwest wing beyond the core dims more gradually to the tip.  A mag 9 star (HD 205124) is located 12' W, a mag 9.3 star (HD 205308) is 8' N, and a 1.2' pair of mag 9.5/10 star is ~7' NE.


11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): moderately bright, fairly large, edge-on 5:1 NW-SE, 4.0'x0.8', broad concentration but with no distinct core.  Irregular surface brightness with a mottled appearance at 127x.  Appears to fade suddenly in a couple of spots (possibly due to dust) including just SE of a mag 14 star that is superimposed on the SE side.  Viewed at an elevation of 13°.

17.5" (9/7/96): extremely faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  Requires averted vision and finder chart to pinpoint location but once identified could nearly hold continuously.  I probably only viewed the core as listed dimensions are much larger.  Located 7' W of mag 6.9 SAO 213103.  Not found on a previous attempt.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7091 = h3873 on 1 Sep 1834 and recorded "eF; pL; vgbM; 2'; place considerably uncertain [given to the nearest min of time and minute of dec], having been found when much past the meridian in searching in vain for Dunlop 561.  This nebula is much too faint to have seen with 9 inches aperture.  It precedes a * 6m nearly in parallel, about 40 seconds of time."  His position is poor, but the description most likely applies to ESO 403-008 = PGC 66972, which is 1.3 minutes of time west and 8' north of JH's position.  The bright star he mentions is mag 6.9 HD 205186.


Lewis Swift probably found this galaxy again on 9 Jul 1897 and described Sw. XI-206 (later IC 5114) as "eF, pS, R, e wide D* f 30 sec."  His RA, though, is nearly 2 minutes too small and his declination 3.5' too far south, though there is a wide 1.2' pair that is 30 seconds following.  So, despite his poor position (very common in his last two lists), IC 5114 is likely NGC 7091.

10x30 IS binoculars (6/13/07): naked-eye fuzzy patch is well resolved into ~15 stars in the 10x30 binoculars and approximately two dozen in the 15x50s. To the south of M39 begins the long dark streamer, Barnard 168, which is striking in 15x50 IS binoculars.  This dark lane leads to the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146), which is not visible in binoculars.


Charles Messier discovered M39 = NGC 7092 = h2126 on 24 Oct 1764, although as a naked-eye object it was probably noticed much earlier. On 27 Sep 1788 (sweep 866), WH logged "consists of such large and straggling stars that I could not tell where it began nor where it ended.  It cannot be called a cluster."

Shows best at 100x. At 220x, the group does not look at all like a cluster and is only distinguished by the few brighter stars.  RNGC classifies it nonexistent.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7093 = h2127 on 19 Sep 1829 and recorded "The chief star (9m) in a cluster of 8th class.  The double star #1660 of my 4th catalogue belongs to this cluster."  His position corresponds with mag 8.7 SAO 51043.  R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" on 6 Sep 1856, logged "a few B st, (not more than 10 or 12m), forming a very loose cluster."  Based on a Heidelberg plate, Reinmuth reported "one vB* and a few pB st in a dense region."  RNGC classifies NGC 7093 as nonexistent (Type 7 cluster).

Unfiltered, a mag 14.5-15 star was visible at the NE edge.  The planetary apppeared weakly annular and brighter in a 90° arc along the west side.  There appeared to be a knot or local brightening right at the west edge of the rim.  Located 1.8° NE of M15.


The compact galaxy II Zw 141 lies 6' WNW.  It appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.  On the DSS a mag 15.2 star is at the southwest edge (6" separation from the center of II Zw 141) and probably the galaxy + star were merged visually.


18" (10/9/04): picked up at 73x using the OIII filter as a fairly faint, round, evenly lit 90" disc.  Good contrast gain with the filter.  Faintly visible unfiltered at 160x as a moderately large but low surface brightness halo surrounding the 13.5 magnitude central star.  A faint mag 14.5 star is at the NE edge of the halo.  A string of 3 mag 14-15 stars oriented NW to SE lies ~2' NE.  Images show the a complex multi-rim structure (brighter along the west side) with a darker center, but visually the planetary appeared pretty featureless.  Located 7' S of a mag 10 star (SAO 107277).


17.5" (10/2/99): at 100x and OIII filter appears fairly faint, round, moderately large, 1.5' diameter, even glow.  At 220x without filter, the central star is easily visible surrounded by a round, low surface brightness glow.  A very faint star is at the NE edge. No annularity seen.


13" (6/18/85): at 62x with filter appears faint, moderately large, round.  Without a filter the faint mag 13.7 central star is visible surrounded by a very low even surface brightness halo 1.5' in diameter.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7094 = Sw. II-88 on 10 Oct 1884 and recorded "nebulous star; B *; in eeF nebulosity; v diff.; nearly pointed to by 3 st. in a line."  His RA is 34 seconds too small.  He added in a footnote, "This is a prototype of GC 4634 [NGC 7023] and several others, and of No. 7 of my Catalogue No. 1 [NGC 2247], which differs from most nebulous stars by being exactly in the center of circular nebulous atmospheres of uniform brightness."  Wolfgang Steinicke mentions that Swift called this object "the most wonderful of all [nebulous stars] - in fact it is the only instance known to me - for instead of the central star being single, it is double."  There is a second star involved but it is not central, rather displaced to the northeast edge.


Lubos Kohoutek rediscovered NGC 7094 during a visual survey of the POSS and included it in a list of new PN (K 1-19) published in 1963.

48" (10/27/19 and 10/24/14): at 375x; several hundred stars were resolved right down to a small brighter nucleus.  Several very bright stars were in chains that emanated from the core. The halo seemed fully resolved with a very large range in magnitudes.  The outer halo was scraggly and contained some bright stars, but overall the halo was fairly symmetric.


The first of three bright stars in a string directly to the north of the core (~40" N of center) was clearly orange (red-giant) as well as the first of a string of three bright stars starting at the west edge of the core (~55" W of center) extending northwest.  A few other brighter stars either appear yellow or very pale orange!


17.5" (8/17/01): viewed at 575x in excellent seeing.  Very irregular appearance with strings of stars emanating from an irregular bright, partially resolved core.  A prong off the west side heads northwest and includes three equally spaced similar stars along with a close triple.  Another bright line of three stars heads due north with a fainter bent elbow of stars angling towards the NE.  Roughly a dozen stars trail to the east with a large gap towards the edge of the halo.  A fairly well defined semi-circle of stars open to the north passes directly through the core and off the SE side.  The outer halo is peppered with dozens of faint stars over a dim background haze and with concentration the overall diameter increases significantly to at least 10'.

Charles Messier discovered M30 = NGC 7099 = h2128 = h3878 on 3 Aug 1764.  WH first observed the globular on 31 Jul 1783 using his 12-inch (small 20-foot) and reported "Power 200; it consists of very small stars; with two rows of stars, 4 or 5 in a line."  He later wrote, "It is a difficult step i.e. if we divide the transition from the Pleiades down to the Nebula in Orion into six steps, this perhaps the 4th towards the real nebulas.  The stars in this seem to be of two different sizes for I perceive 3 or 4 very visible ones branching out towards the north and several more exceedingly small at the sides.  Towards the south in one place the light is very intense, but has all the appearance of crowded stars; so that there remains no doubt of the whole being stars."


In PT 1814, WH summarized his observations of M30 as a "brilliant cluster, the stars of which are gradually more compressed in the middle.  It is insulated, that is, none of the stars in the neighborhood are likely to be connected with it.  Its diameter is from 2' 40" to 3' 30".  Its figure is irregularly round.  The stars about the centre are so much compressed as to appear to run together.  Towards the north, are two rows of bright stars 4 or 5 in a line."  He speculated in his 1814 publication that the "lines of bright stars, although by a drawing made at the time of observation, one of them seems to pass through the center, are probably not connected with it."


JH made the following detailed observation on 23 Sep 1830: "Fine cluster; irreg R, with two projections A, B, at its northern side. (See fig. 90.) A is directed from the central brightness and consists of 3 or 4 bright stars 12 m; its position taken with microm = 350.4°; B originates in the preceding side of the centre, and is directed in a position 331.7° in a line not passing the centre; diam = 6', stars = 12m; fine object; has a * 9 m preceding it (2 or 3 diameters by diagram)."  From the Cape of Good Hope, he logged "Globular, B; lE; bM; 4' l, 3' br; all resolved into st 16m, besides a few 12m.  Two lines of rather larger stars run out n[orth f[ollowing]."

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 7100 = Big. 90 on 31 Aug 1886.  His position in the second Comptes Rendus list (used by Dreyer in the NGC) is poor, landing 3.7' west-northwest of CGCG 402-012 = PGC 67118. Bigourdan provided a corrected position in his 6 May 1901 Comptes Rendus paper and it matches a single star at the position given here.


Unfortunately, Albert Marth's discovery position for NGC 7101 (CGCG 402-012) was also poor and as a result the CGCG, RNGC and PGC misidentified CGCG 402-012 as NGC 7100 and the RNGC and PGC misidentify PGC 67112 as NGC 7101.  In the IC I Notes, Dreyer incorrectly suggests NGC 7101 = NGC 7100; "[NGC 7101 was] not seen by Spitaler; evidently = 7100" and this may have contributed to the modern misidentifications.  I botched the identifications in my RNGC Corrections #2.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7101 = m 448 on 3 Aug 1864 and noted "F, vS, R, stell."  There is nothing near his position, but 6' due south is CGCG 402-012 = PGC 67118.  This galaxy is the middle and easily the brightest of three on a line oriented northwest to southeast, so it's the most likely candidate.


RNGC, CGCG, PGC (and secondary sources such as Megastar) misidentify CGCG 402-012 as NGC 7100 (see that number for the identification) and the RNGC and PGC (as well as Megastar) misidentify PGC 67112 as NGC 7101.  PGC 67112 is the northwest galaxy in the trio (2.3' from NGC 7101).

24" (7/30/16): fairly faint, moderately large, roundish, fairly low overall surface brightness, broad weak concentration.  On images NGC 7102 appears to be interacting with PGC 214783, an edge-on 1.1' SSW.  At 220x, it was glimpsed several times in the same position.  It was too faint for any details, including elongation, but appeared very small.


24" (8/23/14): fairly faint, fairly large but diffuse, elongated 3:2 or 4:3 NNW-SSE, ~1.3'x0.9' but halo appears to alter its shape with averted vision (sometimes smaller) as fainter parts of the halo pop in and out of view.  A mag 10.2 star lies 3.5' SSE.


PGC 214783, an extremely faint edge-on, is just 1' SW.  With careful viewing I had 2 or 3 momentary "pops" at this position over a couple of minutes, too fleeting for any details.


17.5" (8/2/86): moderately large but very diffuse, gradually brightens in the middle, slightly elongated NW-SE.  A mag 10 star is 3.5' SSE.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7102 = m 449 on 16 Oct 1863 and noted "F, pL, R."  His position is 1' northwest of UGC 11786.


Harold Corwin notes that IC 5127, found by Guillaume Bigourdan on 27 Oct 1894, is probably a duplicate observation as his re-reduced position is just 5 sec of RA too far east.  But his observation was made on the same night that NGC 7102 was also measured (though a different offset star was used), so this requires he measured the same galaxy twice, once assuming it was new!

This galaxy is located 25' SE of Leavenworth's position but was positively identified as NGC 7105 using the Leander McCormick sketch.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 7105 = LM 1-242 on 12 Sep 1885 and recorded "mag 11.0; vS; E; 310°?; smbMN; star n, PA 310°."  There is nothing near his very rough position (the RA is given to the nearest min of time and marked as approximate).  But based on his discovery sketch, Harold Corwin was able to identify MCG -02-55-001 = PGC 67181 as NGC 7105.  This galaxy is ~20' south, but less than 1 min of RA east of  Leavenworth's position.  A brighter star is just 33" northwest (PA ~310°), matching his description.  Because of the poor position, Howe was unable to find it on 3 nights.  This galaxy is not labeled as NGC 7105 in most catalogues, though HyperLeda and NED makes this identification. RNGC misclassifies the number as nonexistent.

Swift's position is 7 seconds of RA west and 1' north (separation of 1.8') from CGCG 427-016 = PGC 67208.  Furthermore his description applies as mag 9.2 SAO 107337 is less than 1' west with a "distant companion" to the northeast.  This galaxy was discovered by Albert Marth 22 years earlier on 3 Aug 1864 and later catalogued as NGC 7113.  Marth's position was 3' too far north.  Assuming Swift was unaware of Marth's earlier discovery, NGC 7112 = NGC 7113.  Howe was unsuccessful in finding this object on two nights.

Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 7114 on 2 Sep 1877 with a 15-inch Grubb refractor at Dunn Echt, Scotland while viewing Nova Cygni 1876 (discovered by Julius Schmidt on 24 Nov 1876).  Copeland reported "through a low power eye-piece and a powerful direct vision prism, held between the eye and the eye-piece, the light of the star was found to be absolutely monochromatic."  In Oct 1885, Lohse claimed the star was surrounded by a small nebulous disc (first reported in 1882).  In the NGC notes and correction section, Lohse is mentioned but not Copeland.  Sherburne Burnham observed the nebula in 1891 with the 36-inch refractor at Lick and noted "at times the new star did not seem to have a perfectly stellar appearance under moderately high powers, but rather to resemble an exceedingly minute nebula."  This was the first of 22 objects in the NGC that was discovered by visual spectroscopy.

The contact "bulge" is identified in NED as NGC 7119B = ESO 288-001, and is probably an interacting companion (same redshift).  The "star" that I noted is likely the brighter stellar nucleus of this galaxy.  NGC 7119 is the brightest member of the cluster ACO S971.

W hile compiling the comprehensive Markree ecliptic catalogue, Cooper or assistant Andrew Graham noted it as a nebulous star or possible cluster . At his position is an unequal double oriented northwest-southeast (nearly merged on the DSS), with separation ~7".  Auwers noted in his 1862 list of new nebulae that in the Heliometer it appeared as an "11th magnitude star, surrounded by some 12-13m stars, perhaps nebulous."  At Birr Castle, it was also found to be a double star.  In fact, all objects noted as nebulous in the Markree catalogue are stars except for a duplicate observation of NGC 4989, which did not receive a NGC number.  See Harold Corwin's comments.

Size 8'x7'


17.5" (10/17/98): fairly high surface brightness nebulosity ~3'x2', surrounding three mag 9.5-10.5 stars at 220x.  At 280x, the brightest region surrounds the southern star (IC 5134) and the star 1' to its northeast.  Just preceding this second star is a small knot that does not appear to be surrounding a star.  The third star is 1' northwest the southern star and has the weakest halo.  An additional pair of stars 1.5' and 2' southwest do not appear to be surrounded by halos.  The entire group is encased in a diffuse glow and the surrounding region appears to be dusty.  IC 5132/5133 are very weak nebulae surrounding two mag 12 stars ~5' NNW.


17.5" (9/23/89): fairly bright reflection nebula surrounded three bright stars.  The brightest portion includes the southern star.  Also a bright knot is at the north end and it does not appear to be surrounding a star (or the star is embedded).


13" (7/20/85): fairly bright with OIII filter but dims using a Daystar 300 filter.  This nebulous region includes four or five stars and appears brighter around these stars.  A small knot is at the north end and a second knot is at the south end.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7129 = H IV-75 on 18 Oct 1794 (sweep 1063) and recorded "3 stars about 9m involved in nebulosity. The whole takes up a space of about 1.5' diam, 2 other stars of the same size and very near are not enclosed in the nebulosity."  On 16 Sep 1798 (sweep 1079) he logged "3 stars about 9-10m involved in nebulosity; 2 sp stars very near them are free from that appearance.  The nebulosity is of the milky kind and considerably strong.  There is a small 4th stars in the nebulosity just north of the following one."  John Herschel's description is similar: "a very coarse triple star involved in a nebulous atmosphere."  On a second observation he gives the relative offsets for the 3 stars (A, B and C), which match my observation.  His mean position for star A (southern star) is: 21 42 59.0 +66 06 12 (2000).  Both father and son clearly refered only to nebulosity surrounding a few stars at the position given here.


Guillaume Bigourdan's position and description for IC 5134 = Big. 339, found on 15 Oct 1895, clearly applies to the nebulosity around star A only, as he thought NGC 7129 only applied to one of the northern patches.  So, IC 5134 is part of NGC 7129.  IC 5132 and IC 5133 refer to separate fainter reflection nebulae surrounding two mag 12 stars ~4' north-northwest, which were discovered by Isaac Roberts in 1895 on a photographic plate.  Bigourdan's NGC 7133 = Big. 91, placed ~10' northeast of NGC 7129, is free of nebulosity and Harold Corwin concludes does not exist.  The RNGC position for NGC 7129 is off by 1.7 minutes of RA and NGC 7133 is misidentified.

Lewis Swift independently discovered the galaxy again on 17 Sep 1897 and described Sw. XI-208 (later IC 5135) as "vF; pL; R; sp of 2 [with XI-209]; not 7130 or 7135."  His position is 4.5' too far southwest, close enough that Howe was able to find it in 1898-99 and measure an accurate position (used in the IC 2).

His position is 22 seconds of RA too large but the description pins down the identification (the stars are west).

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 7133 = Big. 91 on 18 Sep 1884 while observing the NGC 7129 complex.  According to Corwin, Bigourdan's offset is 1 min 26.8 seconds east and 3' 49.7" north of BD +65 1638.  He described a "pretty extended area, perhaps 2' across, in which I suspect some extremely faint nebulosity, at the extreme limit of visibility."  There isn't any visible nebulosity on the DSS at this offset and Harold Corwin classifies this number as non-existent.  See his identification notes.


The RNGC classification is a diffuse nebula but there is no description.  The RNGC position is 4' southwest of the center of NGC 7129, and it's not clear what object or section of the nebulosity the authors are referring to.  The RNGC error is mentioned in my RNGC Corrections #4 and by Gordon Bond in Deep Sky magazine.

The brightest star is 25" due south of the mag 12 star and the faintest mag 15 star is at the west end of the arc.  Nicely resolved at 280x and 410x.  NGC 7131 lies 23' SW.


Christian Peters discovered NGC 7134 around 1860 with the 13.5-inch refractor at the Hamilton College Observatory.  He described it as "very small, but not very faint; nearly S of a star 11m."   Herbert Howe, in his visual survey at Denver, reported "not a nebula; it simply a group of three or four stars of mag 13-14, which is about 40" south of a 10th mag star. A most careful scrutiny revealed no trace of nebulosity."  The DSS confirms there are four mag 14/15 stars in an arc, just 30" south of a mag 12 star.  Harold Corwin agrees with this identification.  RNGC classifies this asterism as nonexistent.

Lewis Swift found the galaxy again on 17 Sep 1897 at age 77 near the end of his observing career and assumed it was new.  His description of Sw. XI-209 reads "eeF; pL; R; 3 B st form a triangle; nf of 2 [with IC 5135 = NGC 7130]."  Herbert Howe reexamined the field in 1899 and realized Swift's #209 was identical to NGC 7135, so Dreyer didn't assign an IC desigation.  But IC 5136, also from Swift just 2 nights earlier, may be another observation of NGC 7135.  See Corwin's identification notes for that story.

There is nothing near his rough position (nearest min of RA) except stars.  Herbert Howe searched for this object with the 20" at Denver and reported "this is a stellar object of mag 13, which Muller suspected to be a nebula.  At times it looked slightly nebulous, and at other times distinctly stellar.  Nothing is visible in the place give in the NGC."  Howe's position is less than 1 min of RA east of Muller's and corresponds with a faint pair of stars (about 10" separation).  A mag 11-12 star is 2' east, clinching this identification.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7139 = H III-696 on 5 Nov 1787 (sweep 775) and recorded "vF, iR, may be a patch of stars but I have not been out long enough, about 1' diam."  His position is within 2' of this planetary.  Four nights later (sweep 776) he reported "vF, S, R, lbM, r."  On 15 Oct 1794 (sweep 1062), he noted "F, irr figure, easily resolvable."  On this sweep, his position is just 1.3' too far south.  John Herschel didn't record an observation.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 24 July 1884.


Heber Curtis first found the spectrum to be of a planetary with a slitless spectrograph at Lick.  Based on a Crossley photograph. Heber Curtis reported (1918) "the oval is 86"x67" in p.a. 20° +/-.  Considerably fainter along the major axis; at the east and west edges slightly brighter streaks appear, indicating a ring or shell formation."


The declination is 8.5' too far south in the RNGC, Sky Catalogue 2000, Strausberg-ESO Catalogue, NGC 2000.0 and the first edition of the Uranometria 2000 Atlas. The position is correct in the NGC and the P-K catalogue.  Kent Wallace was first to note the positional error.

Still, as both observations are clearly written in MS, and, as the difference in PD even then is rather considerable (1' 28"), I have thought it necessary to enter them separately."

18" (8/31/11): At 220x this triple star appears as a soft or nebulous "star" that won't focus sharply.  There is a strong impression, though, of a slightly fainter companion attached on the west side. I could easily see how the merged image of this triple could be taken as a possible nebula (described as a "vF neb[ulous] star").  At 285x it appears to be a double star, though the separation is quite small and the stars were not cleanly resolved in only fair seeing.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 7158 = LM 2-464 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Muller described a "neb*[estimated at mag 14]; *9.5 P 40° ∆2.8'."  In 1898-99 Howe reported "this nebulous star is of mag 13.  It may be double at 270° (west)."  Howe's object is a close double star (fainter component to the west) about 30 seconds of RA east of Muller's rough position (nearest min of RA).  Bigourdan also measured this same multiple star on 10 Sep 1888.


Harold Corwin also identifies NGC 7158 as this object (calling it a triple star).  A mag 10 star is 2.9' in PA 40°, clinching this identification.  The RNGC misidentifies PGC 67698, a faint galaxy about 9' southwest of the triple, as NGC 7158.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7184 = H II-1 = h2143 on 28 Oct 1783, the first night of his systematic sweeps! (internal discovery #1).  He was using the "front-view" mode without a secondary (first 41 sweeps).  He made another observation on 13 Oct 1786 (sweep 609, starting again using the front-view): "F, mE, er, making an angle with two pairs of stars, which are situated in a line from np to sf.  The nebula is also followed by a small star, which continues the angle the nebula makes with the two pairs of stars."  JH made the single observation on 23 Sep 1830, "pB; pL; vmE; position = 64.3°; psvlbM; 2' long."  On 7 Sep 1850, George Stoney (LdR's assistant) reported seeing 4 knots or faint stars in the nebula.


Photographs taken with the 30-inch reflector at the Helwan observatory in Egypt in 1919-20 revealed "spiral with rather compact but well defined whorls [spiral arms] and a B sharp stellar nucleus surrounded by a rather brighter patch of nebulosity.  Ther are signs of absorption in the northwest portion."

William Herschel discovered NGC 7186 = H III-165 on 13 Sep 1784 (sweep 269) and recorded "Five or six stars forming a parallelogram and mixed with very faint nebulosity.  240 confirmed it."  Although an elongated group of about 8 faint stars matching his description is about 4' southwest of his offsets, there is no involved nebulosity.  Herschel used this object as an example of a "small patches consisting of stars mixed with nebulosity" in his 1814 PT paper.  Bigourdan's corrected position from 24 Aug 1884 in the IC 2 notes is accurate.  Reinmuth describes "7 F st; neb not found"  (repeated by Carlson).  See Corwin's notes.

NGC 7193

22 03 03.8 +10 48 06; Peg

Size 8'


18" (8/8/10): I noticed this asterism, while observing IC 5160, located in the same field 7' to the north.  The group is a distinctive asterism of about a dozen mag 11-12 stars that is elongated NW to SE and extends 6'x1' or nearly twice this length if you include some scattered stars extending NW.  The group stands out well at low power and is a good impostor of a scattered cluster.


17.5" (9/23/95): this asterism consists of almost two dozen scattered stars mostly mag 10 and 11 in an elongated 10'x2' group oriented WNW-ESE.  The stars are spread out but well detached in the field and immediately catch the eye at low power.  A faint galaxy IC 5160 lies 7' N of the center of the group.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7193 = h2145 on 13 Oct 1825 and recorded "A coarse straggling cl, stars 9...10m."  His position falls on a blank piece of sky, but 30 seconds of RA preceding is a distinctive string of mag 10 and fainter stars elongated E-W.  Based on Heidelberg plate, Karl Reinmuth reported this object as a "Cl, E, pP, st sc, st 9...15; IC 5160 [galaxy] n."  RNGC misclassifies the number as nonexistent, although the group of stars may be an asterism.  A 2016 preprint titled "Investigation of Galactic open cluster remnants: the case of NGC 7193", concludes "that NGC 7193 is a 2.5 Gyr OCR [open cluster remnant] composed by 15 confirmed members and 19 probable members and located at about 500 pc away from the Sun."

John Herschel discovered NGC 7202 = h3920 on 15 Aug 1835 and recorded "eF; S; star like; [italics] the second of a group of 3."  He later added the note, "It precedes the 3rds 2 beats of the chronom = 1 second.  The RA here set down, it must be noticed, is comparable only with that single value of the RA of the others, which results from sweep 619]."  At his offset from NGC 7203 (3rd in the sweep) is a single star (mag 14.6 in the GSC). Pietro Baracchi searched for this object carefully in Dec 1887 with the Great Melbourne Telescope and also found a single star at Herschel's position.  ESO equates NGC 7202 with this star.

But JH made two transcription errors contributing to the erroneous NGC position.  His position in the General Catalogue (GC) and repeated in the NGC is 1 degree too far south.  Furthermore Harold Corwin found (April 2016), that he made a transcription error in copying the RA from his logbook to the Slough Catalogue, so the RA (marked as uncertain) is 1 hour too small.  Correcting both of these errors, the position of NGC 7210 = h2148 (as well as the description) matches NGC 7487, later discovered by Lewis Swift.

It appeared moderately bright, moderately large, ~50" diameter, well concentrated with a well-defined bright core that increased to the center and a fainter, slightly irregular halo (no spiral structure, though).  HCG 91D is barely off the north edge and appeared fairly faint, very small, round, ~0.3' diameter, very small brighter nucleus with a stellar peak.


ESO 467-011 (misidentified as IC 5168), located 5.6' SW of NGC 7214, was a threshold object and popped a couple of times at 220x as a thin edge-on, ~5:1 NW-SE.  A number of faint ESO galaxies surround HCG 91, including ESO 467-17 21' ESE, ESO 467-16 19' NNE, ESO 467-5 36' WSW.


18" (9/3/05): brightest and largest of four in the HCG 91 group = AM 2206-280 = Klemola 40.  At 225x NGC 7214 appeared fairly faint, fairly small, irregularly round or a ragged edge to the outer halo.  Diameter ~0.8', though grows slightly with averted vision.  Contains a small, bright, round core.  Two mag 13 stars aligned E-W are close south and southwest.  MCG -05-52-035 = HCG 91D is attached at the north end and appears as a very faint, extremely small knot, ~10" diameter.  ESO 467-013 = HCG 91C, situated 2' NE of NGC 7214, appeared extremely faint, very small, round, very low surface brightness, 0.3' diameter.  ESO 467-015 = HCG 91B, situated 5' NNE, appeared extremely faint, small, thin edge-on streak NNW-SSE, 0.4'x0.1'.

An almost stellar companion, MCG -05-52-035 = HCG 91D, is 30" NNE, MCG -05-52-036 = HCG 91C 2.2' NE and MCG -05-52-039 = HCG 91B 5' NNE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7214 = h3926 on 30 Jul 1834 and recorded "a vS cluster or resolvable nebula; irreg R; lbM; 2' diam; has 2 or 3 stars larger than the rest."  His position is accurate.  Herbert Howe, observing with the 20" refractor in Denver in 1898-99, remarked "h calls this a globular cluster.  To me it appeared to be a nebula having a nuclear condensation of mag 12; the surrounding nebulosity was indefinite in extent."I


In 1915 Knox-Shaw reported it was a not a globular cluster, but an open spiral, based on a photograph taken between 1912-13 the Helwan Observatory with the Reynolds reflector.  Based on imges taken 1914-16 it was described as "spiral with two arms, lE 90°, vB stellar nucleus with faint star following 15"."

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): faint, small, round, ~30" diameter, increases gradually to the center.  The halo increases a bit with averted vision to 0.6' diameter.  This unassuming galaxy is in a pretty striking arrangement, sandwiched between brighter NGC 7232 1.9' W and mag 8.9 HD 211121 1.5' following.  NGC 7232B, situated 4' N, was not noticed although the observation was compromised by a partially dewed secondary.


13.1" (8/17/85): not seen from northern California (very low elevation).


John Herschel discovered NGC 7233 = h3932, along with NGC 7232, on 6 Sep 1834 and recorded "F; vS; R; 10".  The following of 2 [with NGC 7232]."  A star 8m follows nearly on the parallel, and another to the north."

William Herschel discovered NGC 7234 = H VIII-63 on 16 Oct 1787 (sweep 768) and recorded "A small cl of stars, the stars pL but not many of them."  His position (CH's reduction) is just off the west side of the cluster.  But the GC and NGC position is nearly 18' too far south (apparently JH made a clerical error) and falls on a blank piece of sky.  Harold Corwin also reduced WH's offsets (1 min 21 sec east and 56' south of Zeta Cephei) and they land directly on NGC 7235, which was found by JH again (h2154) on 16 Dec 1830.  Because of the poor NGC position, Reinmuth looked in the wrong place and concluded "no distinct cluster".  Dorothy Carlson and RNGC repeated this conclusion.  But NGC 7234 = NGC 7235, with discovery credit to WH.

18" (8/17/04): at 225x, nearly three dozen stars are resolved in a 4'x3' group, slightly extended E-W.  The brightest mag 9 star is at the east end.  A rich stream of faint stars over haze is the north side and angling WSW towards a mag 10.5 star on the west end.


17.5" (11/2/91): two dozen stars mag 9-15 in a 4' diameter at 220x.  This moderately concentrated group is elongated WNW-ESE and includes several fairly bright stars.  A mag 9 star is at the east end and there are eight other mag 10-11 stars.  Just west of the mag 9 star is a 1.5' circular hole with no stars.  A mag 10 star at the extreme west edge has 6 faint stars mag 13/14 close following.


A compact group of faint stars 13' S appears as a small, partially resolved nebulous glow at 100x.  At 220x, 7 stars are resolved from mag 14-15.5 within a 1.5' diameter.  I had taken this as NGC 7234 but Corwin's re-reduced position from William Herschel indicates that NGC 7234 is identical to NGC 7235.


John Herschel found NGC 7235 = h2154 on 16 Dec 1830 and recorded "a * 10m, the chief of a p compact cluster of 15 or 20 stars 10...17m.  One, 11m, is of a ruby colour."  His position (measured on two sweeps) is accurate.  JH equated this object with his father's H VIII-63 = NGC 7234, but they were given separate GC and NGC designation, due to an error in precessing the position of NGC 7234.  So, NGC 7235 = NGC 7234.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7236 = m 468, along with NGC 7237, on 25 Aug 1864 and noted "vF, S, stellar."  His declination is off by 1' (too far south).  CGCG fails to label this double system as NGC 7236 + 7237.  Malcolm Thomson mentions this omission in his unpublished CGCG Corrections.

NGC 7237 is the middle of three collinear galaxies (and second brightest) in the compact Arp 169 triplet with slightly brighter NGC 7236 0.6' NW and very compact NGC 7237C 0.6' SE.  NGC 7237C appeared very faint, extremely small, round, ~5" diameter (core), not difficult with averted.  Arp 169 forms a very similar triplet as Arp 170 (also in Pegasus).


17.5" (8/20/88): fainter member of a double system with NGC 7236 35" NW of center.  Very faint, extremely small, round.  In a common halo with NGC 7236.  NGC 7237C, an extremely faint anonymous galaxy, is also just 38" SE!  This galaxy appeared extremely faint and small, round, at visual threshold.  Located 2.8' NE of a mag 10 star.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7237 = m 469, along with NGC 7236, on 25 Aug 1864 and noted "vF, S, stellar."  Dreyer questioned if this object was possibly only a faint star while an assistant at Birr Castle on 29 Oct 1877.

Forms a tight trio with IC 1441 1.4' NNW and IC 5192 1.7' WSW.  Also nearby are NGC 7242 3.5' ENE and IC 5191 4.1' WNW.  The observed elongation is probably due to superimposed mag 16 star on the southeast side.


13.1" (9/3/83): very faint, very small, near visual threshold.  Located 3.5' W of NGC 7242 in a compact group.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7240 = St V-6 on 24 Sep 1873 and recorded "eF, eS, in contact in the north with a very small star."   His position matches CGCG 513-022 = PGC 68415.  At the same time he found NGC 7242 and assumed it was new, but it Auguste Voigt had discovered it earlier in 1865 also at the Marseille Observatory.


MCG fails to label this galaxy as NGC 7240.  RNGC and Dorothy Carlson (in her 1940 list of NGC correction) incorrectly equate NGC 7240 with IC 1441, which is a separate galaxy 1' NNW.  Mentioned in Malcolm Thomson's unpublished "Catalogue Corrections".

A mag 11.5 star is just following the south end 0.8' from center and a mag 13 star is at the NW end.  A mag 10 star lies 3.4' SW.


UGC 11964, an extremely thin and faint edge-on (1.9'x0.15'), lies 5' W.  It was just glimpsed at 262x and 285x and was too faint to see its needle-like shape clearly, though occasionally was visible as a streak, perhaps 20"x6".


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7241 = St IV-10 on 3 Sep 1872.  His RA is 16 seconds too large.  Emmanuel Esmiol's re-reduced position (published in 1916) corrected this error.  Bigourdan also measured an accurate position in 1887, which Dreyer published in the IC 2 Notes.

Auguste Voigt discovered NGC 7242 = St V-7 in 1865 with the 31-inch silver-on-glass Marseille reflector.  He didn't publish a discovery list so was not credited in the NGC but his position matches UGC 11969.  Voigt missed the fainter members of the group including NGC 7240.  Édouard Stephan independently discovered the galaxy again using the same telescope on 24 Sep 1873 and described it as "F; vS; diffuse; slbM; a faint star projecting." His position is very accurate. At the same time Stephan discovered fainter NGC 7240.  The RNGC photographic description "ALMSTEL" does not apply.

A small 1' diameter core is richer.  A large dust lane appears to cut through the 20' field SW-NE and passes the east side of cluster.  At low power other dark patches are evident.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7284 = H II-469 = h3943 on 26 Oct 1785 (sweep 465) and recorded "F, er [easily resolvable] or some of the stars visible; pS, lE." Perhaps one the "stars" was the second nucleus (NGC 7285).  From the Cape of Good Hope, JH logged (sweep 474) "F; E; bM; r; binuclear pos 62.3°.  Rather an equivocal object, whether nebulous or a group, but I incline to regard it as a nebula."  On a later sweep (14 Sep 1835), he wrote "pB; irr R; 25"; involves a double star (13m + 14m)." So, he clearly resolved the two nuclei.


Herbert Howe reported NGC 7284 and 7285 as follows: "The description of 7284 in the NGC is "cF, cS, lE, r, D * inv." The description of 7285, discovered by Lassell [Marth], is "Nebs. * 1' dist from 7284."  I judge 7285 to be simply one of the components of 7284.  Both seem to be nebulous stars. The brighter one is of mag 12.5  The other is of mag 13, and lies at P.A. 60°, distant about 40".  Neither of the stars appeared to be double.  I could not see any nebulosity uniting them, but the sky was rather dull."

William Lassell discovered NGC 7285 in Oct 1862 using his 48-inch at Malta.  For some reason it wasn't included in Marth's catalogue, although NGC 7489 and NGC 2620, also found by Lassell, were included.  Lassell mentioned the discovery in a letter to John Herschel on 1 Nov 1862 and Dreyer included it in the GC Supplement (GCS 5078).

18" (8/31/11): this close pair of stars (seems to be a trio of stars on the DSS) was barely resolved at 220x and initially could have easily passed for a small, nebulous object, elongated NW-SE.  The separation is just a few arc seconds.  Located 21' WSW of 7.4-magnitude HD 213005.


The NGC position happens to fall closer to ESO 602-020 = PGC 68960 (double system), which is identified as NGC 7287 in NED, although this galaxy is less likely to be the NGC object.  ESO 602-020 appeared very faint, small, slightly elongated, bright core.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 7287 = LM 2-468 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory. He described it as "mag 15.0, 0.1' dia, E 330° [NNW-SSE]" with a note "slightly nebulous **."  There are several faint galaxies near his position, but since the Leander McCormick are often 1 or 2 minutes off in time, Corwin suggests NGC 7287 may be a triple star at 22 27 17 -22 07 00 (2000).  This pair is roughly 1 min 15 sec west of Muller's position and the orientation of the stars is northwest-southeast


As far as nearby galaxies, just 16 seconds east and 4' south is ESO 602-020A.  Sherburne Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) found this galaxy and described it as two very faint objects about 20" apart (the following one appeared to a faint star).  Corwin feels this candidate is less likely because of the relatively large difference in declination and the wrong position angle. The RNGC misidentifies ESO 533-030 as NGC 7287.

The bright rim is relatively thick and brightest along the north to NE side within the interior of the annulus (not at the very edge).  A star is embedded at the west edge of this large, enhanced arc (due east of the mag 10.5 star just off the NW edge).  The opposite SW rim is also enhanced in brightness and thicker.  The rim is weakest and thinnest at the WNW end, but with averted vision this end bulges out due to a faint extension or large filament (second ring) that begins just south of the western side of the rim and extends north towards the mag 10.5 at the NW edge of the halo.


17.5" (10/2/99): gorgeous view at 100x and OIII filter.  This huge, annular PN is 15'x12' in size and slightly elongated E-W due to an extension on the west side.  The thick annulus is mottled and irregular with brighter regions along the N, NE and SW edge.  The west side is slightly weaker but very faint extensions from the north and south side towards the west, cause the rim to bulge on this side (part of a second ring).  The west edge of the halo more gradually blends into the background near a mag 11 star off the west side.  At 220x without a filter about a dozen stars are superimposed.  The mag 13.5 central star is easy along with a similar star a couple of arc minutes following.


13.1" (8/15/82): the "Helix" nebula is extremely large, about 15' diameter, clearly annular.  Significant contrast gain with OIII filter permits observation even from the Bay Area. The fairly bright rim is non-uniform appearing brighter along the north side.  About seven stars are superimposed including the mag 13.5 central star.  Appears best at low power due to size and relative low surface brightness.  Easy in the 80mm finder.


8" (10/4/80): huge annular planetary is fairly bright at low power using a Daystar 300 filter.  The rim has an irregular surface brightness.


15x50 IS binoculars (8/27/11): easily visible in binoculars using a pair of narrowband filters.


Karl Ludwig Harding discovered NGC 7293 = Au 48 around 1823-24 at Gottingen University Observatory, probably using an 8.5-inch reflector built by William Herschel.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Harding published a list of 8 new nebulae in Astronomisches Jahrbuch, although the Helix Nebula is the only object he actually discovered, the others being observations of previously discovered nebuae.  Harding's list was not checked until 1857 by Winnecke, so the Helix was not generally known.  Ernesto Capocci independently discovered this huge planetary in late 1824 at Capodimonte Observatory in Naples, but his position was over a degree too far west and the object wasn't found or generally known by others.  In 1856, Christian Peters reported another discovery while he was at Capodimonte Observatory around 1850 (AJ 2, p16).  As late as 1884 Jermaine Porter also reported a discovery, although at that point it was already in the GC.  Both Herschels missed finding this planetary, probably due to its large size.


Based on a September 1912 photograph (4 hour explosure) taken with the Crossley reflector at Lick, Heber Curtis wrote "I would suggest that this interesting object be referred to as "The Helical Nebula in Aquarius" [to distinguish it from the the Helical Nebula in Draco, NGC 6543].  In 1917, Robert Innes, at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, noted it was "seen in both the 3-inch and 9-inch telescopes.  Large, but no detail." and probably based on Curtis' comment, he referred to it as the "Helical nebula in Aquarius."

ESO 533-045 (possibly IC 5226) lies 16.6' SSE.  It was fairly faint to moderately bright, slightly elongated, 1.2'x1.0', sharply concentrated with a very small brighter nucleus, low surface brightness halo.  With careful viewing the core extended into a bar, elongated 2:1 SW-NE.


17.5" (10/13/90): faint, small, round, bright core.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 7294 = LM 1-251 in 1886 and recorded "vF, vS, R."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is 2 minutes of time preceding ESO 533-044.  As his declination is a fairly close match, this identification is reasonable, despite the simple description.  Lewis Swift independently discovered the galaxy on 6 Oct 1897 at age 77 and described Sw. XII-38 (later IC 5225) as "eeF; pS; R; betw 2 stars; a dozen stars in margin of field following, form semicircle, 4 st np a curve, one D, sp of 2 [should be np of 2, with IC 5226].  His position was 36 seconds of time too far west and 2' too far north, but his detailed description matches (specifically "4 st np a curve, one D[ouble]".  So NGC 7294 = IC 5225.

In addition, there are also several mag 15 stars surrounding the mag 10 star that are easier to view with averted vision.  Appears to be an unimpressive random grouping at both 100x and 220x.  Open cluster NGC 7296 is in the same low power field 30' S.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7295 = h2163 on 8 Nov 1831 and recorded "A Milky Way straggler, a poorish cluster of stars 12...13m."  His position corresponds with a mag 9 star accompanied by a small clump of stars close southwest.  Karl Reinmuth called this a "a few st 11...13 in a dense region."  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent ("No cluster").  But Harold Corwin suggests that if his declination is 30' too far north, then NGC 7295 is a duplicate of NGC 7296.  As evidence, JH listed H VII-41 as a synonym (with a question mark), so he was uncertain.  The object described in my notes is the asterism at his position.

17.5" (10/5/91): compact group of roughly 30 stars in a 3'x2' area elongated N-S.  A mag 9 star is at the NW edge.  Most stars are arranged in a curved arc roughly N-S.  A string of four perfectly collinear stars trail from this arc to the NE.  Not particularly distinctive as located in a rich star field.  Contains about ten faint stars mag 14-14.5.  Located 40' E of Beta Lacertae (V = 4.4).


8" (11/8/80): 15 stars extended N-S between two mag 8 and 9 stars.  Appears faint and small with an unresolved background haze.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7296 = H VII-41 on 14 Oct 1787 (sweep 765) and noted "a small cluster of stars, not very rich; like a forming one."  His RA was 40 seconds too large.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7300 = h2164 on 26 Jul 1830 and recorded "F; pL; a strong suspicion; almost sure."  The next night he logged "vF; R; vglbM; 20"; twilight commencing."  His position is just off the south side of MCG -02-57-011 = PGC 69040.  This galaxy was found at Birr Castle on 4 Nov 1850 and described as "a vF neb, 80" long, 10" broad, light seems equable."  With a rough position JH catalogued the Rosse "nova" as GC 4799, but Dreyer realized its equivalence with h2164 and assigned only a single NGC designation.


Harold Corwin suggests Lewis Swift's list XI, #212 (later IC 5204) found on 8 Aug 1896, is probably a duplicate of NGC 7300 despite a very poor position.  Swift's description reads "vF; eE; a ray; p of 2 [with IC 5228 = NGC 7302].  See Corwin's identification notes.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7304 on 20 Aug 1862 while observing NGC 7303.  He claimed it was 137" away and his offset (+2 seconds in RA and +1.2' in dec, implies it lies northeast.  But there is nothing at this position.  On a later observation (5 Oct 1864) of NGC 7303, he searched carefully but could not find the object again.  Dreyer also searched unsuccessfully for NGC 7304 on 29 Sep 1875 at Birr Castle.  A double star is 2' southwest of NGC 7303 (opposite direction).  Perhaps d'Arrest reversed the orientation and this pair is NGC 7304.  In any case, NGC 7304 is not a duplicate of NGC 7303.

The blazar CTA 102, located  5.6' ENE, was near the maximum of a historic outburst.  It appeared marginally brighter than a mag 12.9 star on the AAVSO chart, so perhaps mag 12.7 or 12.8.  This is 4.5 magnitudes brighter than its normal quiescent state.  At z = 1.037, the light-travel time is ~8 billion years.  This is certainly the most distant object in recorded times to be visible in a 6" scope.

Heber Curtis described the photograhic appearance in 1913 based on Crossley plates at Lick as "a small nebula about 1.5' in size, of very unusual form.  Has faint stellar nucleus; ther are three fainter nuclei from which spring short whorls [spiral arms]; these are not arranged as in an ordinary spiral, but overlap."  At the Helwan observatory in Egypt, it was described (1921) as a "3 branched spiral with sharp stellar nucleus.  The north branch starts from a faint almost stellar condensation just n.f. the nucleus.  The branch just south of the nucleus forms an oval around it, much brighter on the south side.  The third branch is also south and curiously broken in the middle."

18" (6/25/04): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~50"x30".  A mag 14 star is embedded on the SE portion of the halo, just 15" from the center.  The brightness of NGC 7320 is comparable to the combined glow of NGC 7318A/B.  The Quintet was viewed at 257x and 300x.  This galaxy has a very low redshift compared to the other group members, so has been a subject of controversy but is likely a foreground object.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7320 = St VIIIa-22, along with the other members of the group, on 23 Sep 1876.  His position is accurate.


This galaxy is probably a foreground galaxy in the Quintet.  The Feb 2001 issue of Astronomy mentions the HST image resolved NGC 7320 but not the other members, confirming it is a foreground galaxy (~35 million l.y. vs. ~270 million l.y.).

17.5" (10/17/98): this is a very faint double star 4.5' SW of the core of NGC 7331.  At 220x only the brighter mag 14 component was evident but at 280x and 380x a fainter mag 15 companion at 15" S was visible.  A wide pair of mag 12/13 stars that are collinear with the core of the galaxy lie 1.5' NW.  RNGC misidentifies NGC 7325 with PGC 69291 at 22 36 33.4 +34 30 05.


Herman Schultz discovered NGC 7325 = Nova VIII on 20 Sep 1865 while observing NGC 7331 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  His micrometric position matches a mag 14/15 double star at 15" separation with the northern component an extremely close double. This pair is situated 4.5' southwest of the center of NGC 7331.  Dreyer also found this object and measured an accurate offset at Birr Castle on 8 Sep 1875 using NGC 7331 as the reference.  It's shown unlabeled on the constructed sketch of the companions to NGC 7331 in the 1880 publication. Karl Reinmuth reported this object as a "? Neb *14.8" based on a Heidelberg plate.


RNGC misidentifies PGC 69261 as NGC 7325.  On the POSS this galaxy appears to have a fairly bright star superimposed making a visual observation extremely difficult.  The identification of NGC 7325 was discussed in my Fall 1986 Deep Sky magazine article as well as in RNGC Corrections #1.

NGC 7326

22 36 52.0 +34 25 22; Peg


17.5" (10/17/98): NGC 7326 refers to a faint, close double star just 2.5' preceding the nucleus of NGC 7331.  It was not seen with certainty at 220x, but was clearly visible at 280x and 380x as a mag 15.5 star (not resolved).  The RNGC misidentifies CGCG 514-066 as NGC 7326.


Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 7326 on 7 Oct 1874.  His micrometric offset (also measured in 1875) from NGC 7331 (153" in PA 278°) points to a close double star 2.5' preceding the nucleus of NGC 7331.  It's also shown unlabeled on the constructed sketch in the 1880 publication. Dorothy Carlson also equated this number with the double star based on Mount Wilson and Lick Observatory plates.


RNGC misidentifies CGCG 514-066 as NGC 7326.  This galaxy is located 12' northwest of NGC 7331.  This error was mentioned in my article on NGC 7331 and its companions in Deep Sky magazine for Fall 1986, as well as in RNGC Corrections #1.

NGC 7327

22 36 57.3 +34 28 02; Peg


17.5" (10/17/98): this number refers to one of the several nonexistent NGC entries in the NGC 7331 vicinity.  A possible candidate suggested by Harold Corwin is a mag 13 star near the tip of the northern extension of NGC 7331.  This single star appeared stellar, although it seems plausible that it might look slightly nebulous due to the faint background haze of the galaxy.  Other fainter nearby stars may instead apply to NGC 7327.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 7327, along with NGC 7338, in 1882 with the 11" refractor near Florence and reported in the narrative portion of his fifth paper (AN 2439).  He mentions finding a total of 8 companions to NGC 7331, including two that are not shown on Lord Rosse's sketch.  No position was given but NGC 7327 was simply noted as "preceding the northern end of the spindle [NGC 7331]."  There are no galaxies or double stars nearby, so he may have mistaken a single faint star.


Harold Corwin suggests the mag 13 star at 22 36 57.3 +34 28 02 (2000) as a reasonable candidate.  Another possibility is the compact galaxy PGC 69261, which has a bright star superimposed (the RNGC misidentifies this galaxy as NGC 7325).  Unfortunately, Tempel didn't leave any additional clues as to the identification of NGC 7327, so any assignment is really a guess.  The identifications in the NGC 7331 group are discussed in my Deep Sky magazine article for Fall 1986.

48" (10/24/14): at 488x, the long dust lane along the west side (running N-S) was very evident as the galaxy is sharply cut off at the bright edge of a thin inner spiral arm (the arm itself was not resolved). A clearly visible outer spiral arm curves sharply counterclockwise around the south side of the halo and shoots directly north.  It continues or merges into a fairly narrow arm just west of the dust lane and extends north of the central region on the west side.


24" (7/21/12): at 322x this showpiece galaxy appeared very bright, very elongated 3:1 NNW-SSE, ~9'x3'.  Contains a very bright, elongated core that is sharply concentrated with an intense stellar nucleus.  The galaxy exhibits subtle spiral structure in the outer halo and the brighter edge of the inner western arm is sharply defined as it shoots north.  Just west of this arm the light drops off sharply due to a long dust lane and the dim glow of the outer halo is clearly visible west of the lane.  Arm structure is also evident at the north and south ends of the central region.  The four background companions to the east fit snugly in the field.


18" (8/1/08): The sharp light cut-off (dust lane) was evident, running along the west side of the galaxy, and the outer halo had subtle structure and variations in brightness that suggested spiral structure.


13.1" (7/27/84): very bright, very elongated 3:1 NNW-SSE, 9'x2.5', very bright elongated core, substellar nucleus.  The west side has a sharper edge due to dust.

Herman Schultz discovered NGC 7333 = Nova IX on 20 Sep 1865 while observing NGC 7331 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  His micrometric position matches an extremely close double star (less than 2" separation) situated 2' northeast of the center of NGC 7331.  The components are just distinguishable on the SDSS.  Karl Reinmuth reported this object as a "nebulous *15, *14 p 0.7'.", based on a Heidelberg plate.

See observing notes for NGC 7322.


John Herschel found NGC 7334 = h3950 on 23 Oct 1835 and recorded "eeF; barely, but certainly seen."  A note was added "the observation makes the RA 29 min 6.5 sec [instead of 28 min], and as the PD fails of a perfect agreement [with his previously two observations of h3950 = NGC 7322], it is not impossible that this may be a different nebula."  In the Cape catalogue, all three observations of this galaxy were listed under the single entry h3950, but he included a second entry in the GC at the wrong position, which became NGC 7334.  So, NGC 7322 = NGC 7334, with a 1 minute error in RA.

24" (7/21/12): fairly faint, fairly small, round, though a mag 14 star on the east side of the core of the galaxy distracts from a clean view.  Sharply concentrated with a very small bright core ~10" diameter and a much fainter halo ~25" diameter.


18" (8/1/08): faint or fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 0.4'x0.25'.  A mag 14.5 star on the east side confuses the view.  Located 5' SE of NGC 7331.


18" (7/19/04): at 322x appears faint, very small, round, ~20" diameter.  The observation is confused by a mag 14 star that is attached on the southeast side and the galaxy appears to bulge out from the star towards the NW.


17.5" (8/27/87): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated.  A mag 14-14.5 star attached at the SE end just 9" from the center confuses the observation as the galaxy appears like a close double.  Located 5.2' SE of the center of NGC 7331 in a group of four faint companions.


17.5" (9/14/85): faint, very small, round, star attached at SE end.


13.1" (9/29/84): very faint, very small, round.  A mag 14 star is superimposed at the SE side.  This is the third faintest of the four companions to NGC 7331 and is located 5' SE of the center of NGC 7331.  NGC 7340 is 4' NE.


George Johnstone Stoney discovered NGC 7337, along with NGC 7336 and 7340, on 10 Sep 1849 and noted "4 knots following [NGC 7331]."  A diagram was made 2 nights later and NGC 7337 was labeled "E".  Despite an accurate position, NGC 7337 was reported in the 1908 Catalogue of new nebulae and clusters found on plates taken with the Crossley reflector, generally of bright nearby galaxies [NGC 7331 in this case].  The plates were taken by Keeler in 1898-00 and this galaxy was recorded as #716 out of 744.

22 37 31.7 +34 24 51; Peg


17.5" (10/17/98): at 220x, a single mag 14 star was clearly visible at this position.  A fainter companion ~12" preceding was not seen at 280x or 380x.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 7338, along with NGC 7327, in 1882 with the 11" refractor near Florence and reported in the narrative portion of his fifth paper (AN 2439).  No position was given but NGC 7338 was noted as located "between the four brighter companions following [NGC 7331], closer to the southern two [NGC 7337 and 7340]."  There are no additional galaxies he might have seen, so this number probably refers to a single or double star.  Harold Corwin suggest NGC 7338 is probably the faint double star about 3' southeast of NGC 7335, which forms an isosceles triangle with NGC 7337 and 7340.  The identifications in the NGC 7331 group are discussed in my Deep Sky magazine article for Fall 1986.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7339 = H II-234 = h2175, along with NGC 7332, on 19 Sep 1784 (sweep 278) and recorded "F, E, r, the direction of the extent different from that of the foregoing [NGC 7332]."  On 20 Oct 1784 (sweep 302) he reported "E of the size of the foregoing [NGC 7332], and the extension in a different direction, almost at rectangles to the former; the direction nearly in the parallel, about 1 1/2' in length." On sweep 290, John Herschel recorded "vF; mE in parallel; 60" l; the following of two [with NGC 7332] and a third suspected."  There is no other nearby third object, so perhaps he glimpsed a very faint star.

Perhaps 50 stars are visible within a 15' circle, though the borders are pretty arbitrary.  There are no rich subgroupings although the background contains some unresolved Milky Way background glow.  This field does not appear to be eye-catching enough to be mentioned by Herschel, but apparently it was.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7358 = h3953 on 20 Jul 1835 and recorded "F; S; R; bM; 15"."  His position is accurate though he missed IC 5250 11.6' WNW, which is brighter than NGC 7358 and found earlier by Dunlop (D 255).

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 7359 = LM 1-256 on 14 Jul 1885 and reported "pF; vS; pmE; bMN."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is less than 1 min of RA too far west and the description fits. Ormond Stone's corrected micrometric position (in the IC 1 Notes) is incorrect as he misidentified the comparison star.  Herbert Howe finally measured an accurate position in 1898-99 with the 20-inch refractor at Denver.

Lewis Swift probably found this galaxy again on 19 Jul 1897 at Echo Mountain and reported Sw. XII-40 (later IC 5237) as "eeeF; eeeS; eeeE; eee dif; a line.  8m * np."  Swift's position was also 2.4 minutes of time too small, but the description fits!  At age 77 Swift's positions were often very poor and he wasn't careful in checking prior discoveries, so the identification IC 5237 = NGC 7361 is nearly certain.

The brightest member, mag 8.5 DH Cep, a very rare spectroscopic eclipsing pair of massive O5.5/O6.5-type stars, is at the west vertex. Also a wide strip of nebulosity is attached near the southeast vertex and extends to the southwest.  A dark band appears to separate this strip from the triangular patch. The surrounding region appears weakly nebulous and the "edge" can be traced with some certainty further the north.  DH Cep is the main ionizing source of the nebula.

The cluster appears to be encased in nebulosity especially from the mag 8.6 star to the star at the east tip of the "V".  Using an OIII filter the nebulosity is quite prominent with some structure and encases the entire cluster.

Johnstone and Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 7384 on 27 Nov 1850 in an observation of NGC 7385/7386 group.  It was placed southeast of NGC 7383 on the diagram of the cluster but not labeled.  Offsets were measured four other nebulae, but not to NGC 7384.  Dreyer's comment "5' nf 7383" in the NGC is incorrect.


RNGC, PGC and SIMBAD misidentify PGC 69819 (due east of NGC 7383) as NGC 7384.  Harold Corwin identifies NGC 7384 with a star (position given here) about 5' southeast of NGC 7383, although there are several other nearby stars that may as well be Stoney's star.

Sidney Coolidge discovered NGC 7403 = HN 22 on 15 Nov 1859 with the 15-inch refractor of Harvard College Observatory during the Zone Survey of equatorial stars.  He simply noted "slightly nebulous" with a rough position (measured in 1 of 2 zones).  As a result, Herschel didn't include this object in the GC but Dreyer added it in the  GC Supplement (#6092).  A mag 13.4 star is close to Coolidge's position at 22 53 06.4 +01 28 57 (J2000), which Harold Corwin equates with NGC 7403.  All 9 of Coolidge's discoveries are stars (single or multiple).


In searching for this object, Sherburne Burnham found a nearby galaxy that he felt was probably NGC 7403.  Dreyer catalogued it as IC 1455 (also observed by Spitaler).  IC 1455 is 40 sec of RA east of Coolidge's rough position and 6.6' south.

There is nothing near Swift's published position for NGC 7414 or after correcting for the offset in RA for NGC 7413.  The RNGC identifies PGC 70008 = PGC 94273 as NGC 7414.  This galaxy is located 1.7' north, but 21 seconds of RA further east.  Harold Corwin feels the RNGC candidate is a plausible identification, but I'm skeptical based on how faint it appeared in my 18".  So, NGC 7414 may be nonexistent (perhaps a faint star).

There are no rich spots and most stars are scattered around the elongated irregular outline.  The brightest two mag 9.5 stars are located near the center (SAO 34961) and at the SE end (SAO 34971).  Located about 8' W of a mag 7.3 SAO 34988.  Appears to be an asterism although listed in Lynga 5.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7429 = h2193 on 29 Sep 1829 and recorded "VIII class; pretty compact, poor cluster; stars 9...11m." His position corresponds with the center of 6' group of 12 brighter stars (mag 9.4-13.3).

48" (10/26/16): at 610x; this object consists of a mag 15 star with a very small galaxy attached on the east side.  A low surface brightness, round glow extended ~10" diameter.  The star and the center of the galaxy are separated by only 5"!  Located 4.3' WNW of NGC 7436 in a group.


17.5" (8/25/95): with direct vision appears as a mag 14.5 star with no noticeable halo.  With averted vision, an extremely small halo is sometimes visible, perhaps 10" in diameter.  Located 4.3' WNW of NGC 7436 and faintest in a group of four galaxies.  A mag 14.5 star is 1.4' SW.  On the DSS the galaxy is virtually stellar with the star attached on the west edge.  The galaxy identified as NGC 7431in the RNGC, UGC (notes) and CGCG is CGCG 475-006 (possibly NGC 7433), located 1.5' NW of NGC 7436 and not seen in this observation though was not difficult in my 24".


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 7431 = Big. 92 on 30 Sep 1886 and noted "eF and eS."  His micrometric position is 19 seconds of time preceding NGC 7436 and 55" north.  Precisely at this separation is faint star with an extremely faint galaxy (PGC 1765321) attached on the east side.  It's like Bigourdan noticed only the star as the galaxy is quite faint, but he mistakenly thought it was a nebula.  RNGC, CGCG, UGC (notes to NGC 7436) and PGC all misidentify NGC 7433 = CGCG 475-006 = PGC 70112 as NGC 7431.


On 12 Oct 1855, R.J. Mitchell discovered the galaxy (CGCG 475-006) that RNGC, CGCG and UGC misidentify as NGC 7431.  Although clearly shown on the sketch, the 29 Sept 1875 observation states "the object preceding in the 1857 sketch is a faint star, night bad."  Because of this last statement, Thomson feels Dreyer decided not to include this object in the NGC but Corwin and Steinicke identify CGCG 475-006 = NGC 7433 and remove the companion jutting out of the west side of NGC.  Malcolm Thomson discusses this case in detail in the Dec 1989 Webb Society Quarterly Journal and his unpublished "Catalogue Corrections."

The historical identification of NGC 7433 is ambiguous (see notes), but this galaxy is misidentified as NGC 7431 (which is 2.9' W) in CGCG, UGC, PGC, U2000 and Megastar.


R.J. Mitchell, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 7433, along with NGC 7435, on 12 Oct 1855.  While observing the field of NGC 7436 this galaxy was clearly shown on a diagram and sketch showing 4 galaxies (including the companion of NGC 7436).  Nevertheless, there are only three entries in the GC and NGC.  The reason is probably Dreyer's 1875 observation that noted "The object preceding in the diagram from 1857 is a faint star.  Night bad".  The question remains which object Dreyer intended to exclude in the NGC -- CGCG 475-006 (the galaxy generally associated with NGC 7433) or the companion at the west edge of NGC 7436?


Malcolm Thomson gives a detailed analysis of the identifications of NGC 7433 and 7435 in his Catalogue Corrections and concludes Dreyer rejected CGCG 475-006 so that NGC 7433 refers to the galaxy the western component of NGC 7436. On the other hand, Harold Corwin supports the view NGC 7436W was rejected by Dreyer and CGCG 475-006 is NGC 7433.  Corwin's identification is used in NED and Steinicke and adopted here, though Thomson's argument is very persuasive.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 7435, along with NGC 7433, on 12 Oct 1855 while examining the field of NGC 7436 at Birr Castle.  The identification is certain based on the diagram and sketch in Plate V, including a star close northwest. The NGC position is 1' due south, instead of southwest of NGC 7436.  Heinrich d'Arrest also measured the position twice in September 1865, although Dreyer only credited d'Arrest's observation of NGC 7433.


The NGC position falls very close to MCG +04-54-007 = LEDA 1763030, and Francis Pease identified this galaxy as NGC 7435 in the 1920 paper "Photographs of nebulae with the 60-inch reflector, 1917-1919".

The halo has a much lower surface brightness and contains NGC 7436B, which pokes out of the halo on the west side.  The contact companion appeared moderately bright, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 E-W, 24"x8", very small bright nucleus.


24" (7/20/12): brightest and central galaxy in a group with three extremely close companions.  At 325x appeared moderately bright and large, round, ~1' diameter.  Sharply concentrated and dominated by a very bright small core.  The halo has a low surface brightness and gradually fades out, but seems to encompass NGC 7436B = VV 84b, which appeared as a faint or fairly faint thin spike, ~22"x8", emerging from the halo and extending west.

PGC 1768375 is extremely faint and small, round, 9" diameter.  Collinear with a mag 15 star 0.7' NE and a mag 13 star 1.2' NE.


17.5" (8/25/95): brightest in a tight group of four galaxies including NGC 7431, NGC 7433 and NGC 7435.  Fairly faint, small, round, 1.2' diameter.  Well concentrated with a small, bright core.  The view is confused by a companion, which is partially superimposed on the west side of the halo and creates the impression of elongation E-W.  A mag 15 star is 50" SW and a mag 14.5 star 1.3' WNW.


17.5" (9/2/89): brightest in a group, faint, small, slightly elongated N-S, bright core.  Forms a double system with NGC 7433 attached at the west end.  In a group with NGC 7435 1.0' SW, NGC 7431 2' NW (not seen).  Located 15' E of mag 8.9 SAO 90886.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7436 = H III-243 = h2195 on 2 Dec 1784 (only object in sweep 327) and recorded "vF, S, er, but I have not been out long enough to see very well, and it may be only stars."  On 18 Aug 1828 (sweep 167), JH logged "F; E in parallel; gbM; 60" l, 30" br."  Although not resolved, the elongation was caused by the superimposed companion on the west side.


The RNGC identifies the brighter eastern component as NGC 7436A and the western component as NGC 7436B.  The identification problems with this group (specifically NGC 7433 and 7431) are discussed in detail in the Oct 1989 Webb Society Quarterly Journal and in Malcolm Thomson's unpublished "Catalogue Corrections".


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 7436B = MCG +04-54-005 = PGC 70123 on 23 Oct 1855 and noted "3 neb; last one [NGC 7436] pB, bM, has either a star or nebulous knot closely p [NGC 7436]; ...."   The "nebulous knot" is NGC 7436B.  He observed the group again on 18 Sep 1857 and logged, "... closely p is a * or sharply defined nebulous patch, ..."  Dreyer observed the group on 29 Sep 1875 and reported, "The object p in the diagram from 1857 is a F *.  Night bad."  Harold Corwin notes that based on Dreyer's own observation, he didn't assign the western component of NGC 7436 an NGC designation.  NED identifies this galaxy as NGC 7436A and HyperLEDA calls it NGC 7436B.

17.5" (8/13/96): at 100x, there is a 20' elongated group of stars separated into two distinct scattered subgroups. The SW group is circular, ~6' diameter with roughly three dozen stars total, although there are a dozen brighter mag 10/11 stars which form the circular outline.  Only a few faint stars populate the interior of the outline.  The NE group is more elongated, ~7'x5', with two dozen stars.  It includes a nice well-matched mag 11 pair at 15" separation.  The two groups only stand out in a rich Milky Way field using a 20 Nagler but it still looks like a random grouping.  Listed as nonexistent in Carlson and RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7438 = h2196 on 8 Nov 1831 and recorded "A large oblong cluster which fills 2 fields.  Place that of the double star h3157 of my 5th catalogue."

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7439 = m 512 on 9 Sep 1863 and noted a "long patch of F nebulosity."  His position is 30 seconds of RA east and 1' north of UGC 12273.  Interestingly, I recorded this galaxy as round, so his description does not fit this galaxy very well.  Bigourdan published a "corrected" position from 3 Aug 1891 in his Comptes Rendus list for 22 Jul 1901, but his position is 3.6' south and 20 seconds of time too large and probably refers to one or more stars.


Karl Reinmuth reported "not found" in his photographic survey at Heidelberg as well as Heber Curtis in Lick Observatory Bulletin #248 (1913) based on photographs with the Crossley reflector.  Harold Corwin searched unsuccessfully for another candidate besides UGC 12273.  See his notes.

His rough position (RA to the nearest min and Dec marked as uncertain) is coincidentally just 14 seconds of RA east of MCG -01-58-013 = PGC 70186.  The RNGC, PGC and HyperLeda identify this galaxy as NGC 7441, although no 10th magnitude star is preceding.  However, the 19th century estimated magnitudes were often several mags too bright and a mag 11.7 star is 1.8' NE and a mag 12.5 star 5' WSW.


As an alternative, Harold Corwin suggests NGC 7441 = IC 1458 = PGC 70080.  This galaxy has a 10th magnitude star 10' west, though the position is 3 minutes of RA east and 20' south of Stone's position.  Neither identification is very secure.

While compiling the comprehensive Markree Ecliptic Catalogue he thought he found a nebulous mag 11-12 star.  Arthur Auwers searched and reported "no nebula can be seen" using the Heliometer at Konigsberg.  Wilhelm Tempel was also unsuccessful on several attempts (AN 2284), as well as Sherburne Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II).

The galaxy has a weak enhancement along the southwest edge of the halo [spiral arm] and a fairly faint knot is on the southeast side [40" SE of center].  Overall, the southern part of the halo has a lower, more uniform surface brightness.


17.5" (9/19/87 and 9/14/85): bright, large, elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE, small bright core, fainter extensions.  Brightest in the NGC 7448 group.


13.1" (9/22/84): fairly bright, broad moderate concentration, thin fainter extensions NNW-SSE.  Does not contain a well-defined nucleus.


8" (9/25/81): faint, small, elongated.  NGC 7454 is located 29' NNE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7448 = H II-251 = h2199 on 16 Oct 1784 (sweep 294) and recorded "pB, cL, E, r."  On his sweep 11, JH logged "pB; L; vgbM; E pos 85° np to sf."  His mean position is accurate.  Ralph Copeland commented it was "slightly concave towards p side" in a 1873 observation at Birr Castle.  Christian Peters also measured an accurate position.

24" (12/28/13): at 282x appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter, extremely small or stellar nucleus.  Located at 3.1' W of brighter UGC 12302 (NGC 7459?).

A mag 14.5 star lies 2.1' SSW.  This galaxy is not listed in any modern catalogue and the identifications of NGC 7452 and NGC 7459 are uncertain due to poor positions by Lewis Swift.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7452 = Sw. II-95, along with NGC 7455 and NGC 7459, on 14 Oct 1884 and recorded "eeeF; pL; R; e diff.; np of 2 [with NGC 7459]."  His position falls within a small cluster, 9 seconds of RA east of UGC 12302.  RNGC, MCG and PGC identify UGC 12302 as NGC 7452.  It's the brightest member of the cluster and a double system with nuclei only 10" apart.   Herbert Howe apparently also identified this galaxy as NGC 7452 (MN, Vol 60, 129).


As an alternative, Corwin suggests that NGC 7452 = LEDA 1306660, the second brightest in the cluster.  This places NGC 7452 21 seconds of RA preceding Swift's position (matching in dec).  This identification was first made by Kobold in his 1907 catalogue. NED and HyperLeda now both use this identification. This implies NGC 7459 = UGC 12302, which is 12 seconds of RA larger (Swift's difference is 20 seconds).

Christian Peters discovered NGC 7453 on 7 Nov 1860 with the 13.5-inch refractor at Hamilton College Observatory. At Peters' position of 23 01 25.4 -06 21 17 (2000) is a pair of mag 12.5 stars at 15" separation.  His observation may refer to one of these stars as his description reads "*11 north, close to it."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7455 = Sw. II-96, along with NGC 7452 and 7459, on 14 Oct 1884 and recorded "eF; cE; pS * nr p.  Found while searching for Encke's Comet 1885 I."  There is nothing at his position, but 38 seconds of RA west is CGCG 405-021 = PGC 70246 and Kobold identified this object as NGC 7455 in his 1907 publication.  RNGC and CGCG also identify CGCG 405-021 as NGC 7455.  Herbert Howe noted, though, that there is no star "nr p[receding]."  A mag 12 star is 1.2' north-northeast of this galaxy, but not in the right orientation and furthermore this small galaxy is not "cE".  Because of this discrepancy Corwin suggests that perhaps NGC 7455 actually applies to the comet!   Bigourdan searched for NGC 7455, but his position refers to a star.  See Corwin's notes.

IC 5283 is a very faint glow, small, round, diffuse, with an even surface brightness.


13" (11/13/82): moderately bright, small, round, small bright nucleus surrounded by small diffuse halo.  The nucleus dominates the galaxy.  Located along the west side of three mag 9-10 stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7469 = H III-230 = h2204 on 12 Nov 1784 (sweep 313) and noted "eF, eS, but 240 left a doubt."  He found it again on 26 Sep 1785 (sweep 442) and logged "suspected a small irregular patch with seeming nebulosity."  He didn't link the second observation with the first or assign it an internal discovery number.  JH made the single observation "F; S; R; vsmbM; equals a star 12m with a vF wisp about it.  At first seems like a star."  The RA in the RNGC is 1.0 minute too large.  NGC 7469 is one of the 6 original Sy 1 galaxies studied by Seyfert in his seminal 1943 paper "Nuclear Emission in Spiral Nebulae".

Otto Struve found NGC 7472 on 7 Dec 1865 with the 15-inch Merz refractor at Pulkovo Observatory while unsuccessfully searching for comet Biela.  He noted a faint star with a nebulous halo.  There is nothing near his position, but exactly 2.0 minutes of RA east is NGC 7482, which was discovered by Marth the previous year on 11 Aug 1864.


Sherburne Burnham, who examined the field (see Publ of Lick Obs, II), noted there was only one galaxy in the vicinity, essentially agreeing with Marth's position for NGC 7482, and that NGC 7472 as well as d'Arrest's NGC 7477 were probably duplicates.  Dreyer mentioned this in the IC I Notes, although NGC 7477 is a different object.  See NGC 7477.

With careful viewing this is clearly seen as a double system with a companion attached at the northeast end (MCG +03-58-028 = PGC 70382).  It was visible as a faint, small, round glow, 12" in diameter.  The centers of the galaxies are separated by just 27" and nearly collinear with NGC 7474.

23 04 40.7 +03 07 05; Psc

V = 15.0;  Size 0.3'x0.15'


18" (9/26/11): this number applies to an extremely faint galaxy with a star superimposed.  At 175x, it appeared as a faint, nebulous patch (perhaps 15" diameter) with one or two very faint stars involved.  At 225x, three mag 14.5 stars were resolved including a 15" pair but a third star close north was not involved in the glow.  It was easy to see to see how this knot of stars could be taken as nebulous even if the galaxy was not seen.  NGC 7482 lies 15' ESE.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7477 on 9 Sep 1866 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  At his exact position is a group of 3 faint stars and an extremely faint galaxy (LEDA 1245518).  Probably d'Arrest picked up the combined glow of a faint star and the galaxy (V = 15.0) or else two close stars.  Hermann Kobold's position, measured in 1898 at the Stasbourg Observatory, is at the north end of LEDA 1245518, where a faint star is attached. Reinmuth also identified NGC 7477 as "4 st 15 in Dreyer's place; ? eeF vS neb s of 2nd * alm att?, neb E 75 deg?."


Burnham noted the odd situation that NGC 7477 and 7472 precede Marth's NGC 7482 by exactly 1.0 tmin and 2.0 tmin of RA, respectively, and felt all 3 numbers referred to the same galaxy.  But Harold Corwin notes that only NGC 7472 (discovered by Otto Struve) is identical to NGC 7482.

48" (11/2/13, 10/30/16 and 10/28/19): The view of NGC 7479 was mesmerizing at 488x and 610x.  Compared to the view last October, I noticed the fainter eastern arm was broader (split in two parallel branches on images) and although diffuse, obviously extended all the way to the southern edge of the galaxy, nearly reaching a mag 16 star.  Also the bright arm on the western side of the bar dimmed as it extended north, but wrapped all the way or just beyond a mag 15.7 star situated 48" SW of the bright mag 12.5 star off the north end of the bar.  The western arm clearly had a clumpy appearance with a couple of brighter patches.  Near the south end of this arm [1.1' SSW of center] is a very faint quasi-stellar knot, which is catalogued as HII region #45 in Hodge and Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  Another brighter knot, ~12"x6", is at the southwest end of the arm [1.5' SW of center].  This is region #57 in the HK Atlas.  A faint edge-on (V = 17.8), lies 3.5' NW of NGC 7479.


48" (10/22/11): NGC 7479 is probably the best barred spiral in the northern sky. At 488x and 610x the central bar appears very bright and extended over 2' N-S. The bar had a mottled appearance, bulging slightly in the center, was broadly concentrated with a small bright core. A bright mag 12.5 star is at the north end of the bar, 1.3' from the center.


At the northern end, an arm emerges from the bar and begins to curve counterclockwise to the east, but abruptly dims and merges with the halo on the east side. At the south end of the bar, a beautiful sweeping arm wraps counterclockwise around the south of a superimposed mag 13.5 star, extending to the west side of the core. This prominent arm dims and ends just north of an extremely faint HII knot (stellar) in the arm, which is catalogued as object #4 in Rozas' et al 1999 A&AS paper "Global properties of the population of HII regions in NGC 7479 from photometric H-alpha imaging". A mag 16.4 star is 0.7' due west (outside the arm) of this knot. A mag 15.7 star is also superimposed between the faint HII knot and the bright star at the north end.


18" (11/7/07): I was surprised the thin spiral arm was readily visible from Lake Sonoma extending from the south end of the bar and wrapping outside the mag 13.5 star situated 50' SW of the core.  This arm dimmed out roughly due west of the star.  The central bar extends 2.4'x0.6' N-S and contains a bulging 25" core that broadly brightens to an occasional faint stellar nucleus with direct vision.  Barely off the north end of the central bar is a mag 12.5 star (1.3' due north of center) and there was just a hint of the spiral arm at the north end of the bar beginning to bend towards the east.


18" (10/19/06): fairly bright, fairly large, the main bar appears elongated 3:1 N-S, moderately concentrated with a bright core.  A mag 12.5 star is just off the north tip of the bar.  At the south end an extension is generally visible with averted vision hooking back sharply on the west side towards the north.  This spiral arm dims as it hooks but intermittently appears to sweep due north though does not extend as far as the mag 13.5 star off the SW side of the core.


17.5" (7/19/90): this is one of few northern barred spirals in which the structure is clearly visible. A bright bar is oriented N-S with a bright core and nearly stellar nucleus. A mag 13 star is off the north edge 1.4' from center and a fainter mag 14 star is 47" SW of center. A thin curving spiral arm attached at the south end curves to the west and then north beyond the mag 14 star SW of the core. This arm parallels the bar along the west side about 90°. At the Sierra Buttes, the spiral arm was held almost continuously with averted vision. Located 3.3' NNE of a mag 10 star.


17.5" (10/12/85): thin curving arm clearly seen attached at the SW end curving to the north around a faint star.


13.1" (9/29/84): fairly bright, elongated ~N-S.  Strong impression of a dark lane or gap on the west wide and brief hints of haze beyond this gap, particularly around the south end towards the west (spiral arm).


13.1" (11/5/83): fairly bright, elongated N-S, bright core.  Two faint stars are west and north.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7479 = H I-55 = h2205 on 19 Oct 1784 (sweep 299) and noted "F, mE, r, near 3' in length and about 1' in breadth; I see 2 or 3 stars in it; but they do not seem to belong to it."  On 23 Nov 1785 (sweep 476) he noted "cB, mE nearly in the direction of the meridian; about 4' long, about 2' broad, gbM."  A sketch was published in 1811.


Lord Rosse or his assistant George Johnstone Stoney sketched NGC 7479 on 10 Sep 1849 (figure 4 in the 1850 PT paper).  The sketch shows a single prominent spiral arm wrapping nearly completely back to the bar, though the form was uncertain: "Spiral, but query whether this is not more properly an annular than a spiral nebula."  Tempel, John Herschel and d'Arrest made additional sketches.


In the 1900 paper "The spiral nebula H I 55 Pegasi" (1900ApJ....11....1K), Lick astronomer James Keeler compared the various sketches of NGC 7479 with the photograph taken with the Crossley reflector to demonstrate the subjectivity of sketches and their limitations compared to photographs.

Not knowing the nature of this object, I logged NGC 7486 as "very faint, extremely small, forming a close pair with a mag 15 star" and assumed this observation referred to a very small galaxy.

The original discovery of this galaxy was made by JH on 17 Nov 1827, but Harold Corwin found (April 2016) that he made a transcription error in copying his logbook RA to his Slough Catalogue, so the RA (marked as uncertain) is 1 hour too small.  Furthermore, he made another error when transferring the declination to the General Catalogue, so his GC and NGC north polar distance is one degree too large!  Correcting both of these errors, the position of NGC 7210 = h2148 matches NGC 7487.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7490 = St X-39 on 11 Oct 1879.  His position is an exact match with UGC 12379.  Edward Holden found this galaxy again on 21 Aug 1881 with the 15.6-inch Clark refractor at the Washburn Observatory.  He assumed it was new and reported it as #23 in his list of new nebulae in the Publications of the Washburn Observatory, Vol I.   Both Stephan and Holden are credited with the discovery in the NGC.

24" (11/24/14): picked up at 200x as a faint, large, low surface brightness glow with a very weak concentration, 4'-5' diameter.  At 375x, a few resolved stars shone steadily and quite a number popped in/out view consistently.  Perhaps two dozen were intermittently resolved, though the surface was too lively (particularly with averted vision) to count reliably. These are the brightest red giant members and range from mag 15.5 to 16+.


17.5" (8/1/86): faint, large, round, diffuse, no resolution.


8" (8/2/81): very faint, diffuse, moderately large, no resolution.  Very low surface brightness for a NGC globular and difficult with this aperture.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7492 = H III-558 = h2208 on 20 Sep 1786 (sweep 595) and recorded "eF, cL, iR.  By changing and wiping the eye glasses, I saw it with both so as to leave no doubt.  5 or 6' dia."

24" (10/6/18): at 260x; between faint and fairly faint, fairly large, irregularly round or slightly elongated (outer halo changes with averted), ~1.25'x1.0', broad concentration with an ill-defined brighter core.  The surface brightness is slightly uneven and gave the sense of a face-on spiral (later confirmed).


UGC 12416 lies 7.4' WSW.  At 260x and 375x it appeared at least fairly faint and nearly moderately bright, small, ~18"x10", surprisingly high surface brightness with a sharp stellar nucleus!    The galaxy is collinear with a mag 10.1 star 2.8' NNE and a mag 12.2 star 1.8' NNE.


17.5" (9/23/89): very faint, fairly small, almost round, diffuse.  Located 6' N of a wide double star mag 9/11 at 21".


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7519 = m 534 on 5 Oct 1864 and noted "vF, pL."  His position is a perfect match with UGC 12424.  Harold Corwin notes that Bigourdan's RA "correction" in the IC 2 notes applies to another galaxy (UGC 12416 = Mrk 526) that is located 28 seconds of RA further west and 2.5' north.

NGC 7520 is listed as nonexistent in most sources.  Harold Corwin suggests the possibility that NGC 7520 is equivalent to IC 5290 (described above).


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 7520 = T I-49 in 1876 and noted "class II size; class III brightness; seen repeatedly; position difficult to determine."  There is nothing near his rough position (given only to the nearest min of time and noted as very uncertain "::").  Herbert Howe was unsuccessful in locating it on two nights at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.


Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 7520 may be identical to IC 5290, discovered by Johann Palisa on 4 Oct 1896 with the 27-inch refractor at Vienna (1897AN....143...49W).  This requires Tempel's declination to be 20' too far south, though the RA is less than a minute off.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 7549 along with NGC 7553, on 2 Nov 1850. Whilehe was observing NGC 7547 and NGC 7550 he found "4 neb in the field, perhaps another [including NGC 7547 and 7550]."  No positions were measured.  A diagram made in 1877 was published in the 1880 publication.  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered this galaxy on 30 Aug 1864 and made a total of 4 observations.  Herman Schultz also measured an accurate micrometric position, attributing the discovery to d'Arrest. Bigourdan noted the equivalence of d'Arrest's GCS 6151 and LdR's GCS 4912.  Dreyer combined the two GC designations in the NGC.

17.5" (7/17/93): very faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, very small brighter core, stellar nucleus.  Located 11.1' E of NGC 7540.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7551 = m 548 on 3 Nov 1864 and noted a "neb. star 13m."  His position is less than 1' south of LEDA 3978375, which has a very faint star superimposed on the southwest side.  Interestingly, Edward Fath reported in his "A Study of Nebulae" (1914) there was a double star in the position of NGC 7551, based on plates taken with the 60-inch at Mt. Wilson in 1909-1912.  Apparently the galaxy was stellar-like on the plate.


RNGC misidentifies a close companion 20" NE of NGC 7540 as NGC 7551.  This identification is clearly wrong as Marth placed NGC 7541 45 seconds of RA following NGC 7540 (both were found on the same night).  Malcolm Thomson reported this error in his unpublished "Catalogue Corrections", as well as Harold Corwin in his NGC identification notes.

The center is punctuated by a sharp, extremely bright stellar nucleus!  A spiral arm was clearly visible attached at the east end of the major axis (bar).  The beginning of the arm rotated counterclockwise towards the south but it shortly dimmed out after a distance ~0.6'.  The main part of the galaxy is embedded in an extremely low surface brightness halo, ~3' in diameter. A mag 13.5 star is off the west end [2.2' from center] and a mag 12 star is at the edge of the outer halo [1.8' S of center].   NGC 7583, the first in the Grus Trio with 7590 and 7599, lies 28' ENE.


13.1" (11/5/83): fairly faint, small, elongated E-W, small bright nucleus.  A mag 10 star lies 4.4' W and a mag 11 star is off the south side.  The Grus trio consisting of NGC 7582, NGC 7590 and NGC 7599 are roughly 35' NE with the entire group called the Grus Quartet.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 7552 = D 475 = h3977 on 7 Jul 1826 and claimed 4 observations.  He described the first member of the Grus Quartet as "a small faint nebula, rather elongated in the parallel of the equator, about 30" broad, and 40" long; there is a pretty bright point situated near the centre of the nebula: a small star precedes it."


John Herschel made a single observation on 2 Sep 1836, logging "B, S, mE, nearly in parallel; vsbM to a star 13m."  Herschel credited Dunlop with the discovery.  Lewis Swift found the galaxy again on 22 Oct 1897 and reported Sw. XI-226 (later IC 5294) as "pB; pS; R; 8m * p[receding] same parallel."  His RA was just 9 seconds too small and his description of the brighter star clinches the equivalence.


Based on a Helwan plate taken in 1919-20, NGC 7552 was described as "vB sharp stellar nucleus; irregular Phi-type spiral; the cross-arm [central bar] is in p.a. 90° and is moderately bright at each end rather than near the middle, where a curious faint circle occurs of diameter 50"; the outer circle [ring] of the Phi is extremely faint except the southeast side."

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 7553 along with NGC 7549, on 2 Nov 1850.  While he was reobserving NGC 7547 and 7550 he found "4 neb in the field, perhaps another [including NGC 7547 and 7550]."  The 4th brightest galaxy in the field is CGCG 454-015, and this was likely seen by Stoney. The 6 Sep 1855 description reads "3 neb [NGC 7547, 7550, 7549], F, S, and perhaps 2 more vS and F f[ollowing] them."  A diagram of the field was made at Birr Castle on 6 Oct 1877 and confirmed on 10 Oct 1877 showing four objects including NGC 7547, 7549 and NGC 7550, although the direction of drift shown is somewhat off.  The object shown in the upper right corner of the diagram should be CGCG 454-015, but the placement better matches 16th magnitude 2MASX J23153890+1858171.  Perhaps it's one of the others that were suspected.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7555 = h2221 on 11 Sep 1828 and recorded "F; R; bM; place very rough; two or three more nebulae suspected in the neighborhood."  His RA and NPD are marked with +/- to the nearest minute of time and minute of arc, respectively.  There is nothing near his position, but if JH was off mostly in RA then NGC 7515 is a candidate.  If he was mostly off in declination, then NGC 7563 is another possibility.  Neither d'Arrest, Schultz or Vogel could recover this object, though one observation was claimed at Birr Castle (but of which object?).  Dorothy Carlson reported "Not Found" in her 1940 NGC/IC Correction paper and Corwin concludes the same.

With averted vision, NGC 7559A = MCG +02-59-014 was seen just off the NNW edge [24" from center].  It appeared extremely faint [V ~15.5] and small, perhaps 8" diameter.  On the SDSS this is an edge-on galaxy, but I probably only noticed the brighter nucleus.  It was a bit easier to view at 282x.  NGC 7563 lies 6.2' SSE.  A mag 9.3 star 8.7' SW forms the vertex of an isosceles triangle with NGC 7563 and 7559.

Herman Schultz discovered NGC 7571 on 25 Sep 1867 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  In his remarks to NGC 7550 in "Micrometrical Observations of 500 Nebulae" he mentions "A poor stellar group of pretty bright stars follows the above nebulae [NGC 7547, 7549, and 7550] about 1 1/2 minutes; and the whole region following this stellar group seems nebulous:  a group of small nebulae or a considerably extended nebulosity with several knots?...Description and position do not at all agree with III. 181 [NGC 7550]!"  There is nothing near the NGC position.  Karl Reinmuth reported "identif very doubtful; vF** dist 0.3' 135d, np * nebulous?, N7571 = N7578?"  Bigourdan's "corrected" position from 23 Sep 1886 applies to this double star.  This equivalence is repeated in the RNGC.


Harold Corwin notes there is no group of "pretty bright stars" 1.5 minutes following NGC 7547/7550 as in Schultz's description, but there is such as group at this separation from NGC 7578.  If Schultz was confused and was actually referencing NGC 7578, then NGC 7571 may be a duplicate of NGC 7597 (the brightest in a group).  This identification is very uncertain, though, as I feel NGC 7597 is too faint for Schultz to have picked up.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7574 on 2 Oct 1866 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  There is nothing near his single position.  Karl Reinmuth reported it not found, and this was repeated by Dorothy Carlson and the RNGC. Harold Corwin suggests that if d'Arrest made both a 30' error in declination (too far south) and 30 seconds in RA (too far east), then NGC 7574 is equivalent to NGC 7568, discovered by Stephan 10 years later.  As both errors involve single digits, this solution is reasonable (though not certain).

I saw also a third star."  He probably resolved the pair, though his separation estimate is much too large. On 15 Oct 1784 (sweep 290), he logged "Suspected, E, 240 shewed 4 or 5 small stars with seeming nebulosity but left it doubtful." JH simply called this object "F" but his position matches - no mention of being double or nearby faint stars.  The brighter northeast member is designated NGC 7578B in RC2, RC3, UGC, MCG and Hickson.  See Corwin's notes for a full discussion.

Horace Tuttle discovered NGC 7581 on 11 Jan 1875 with the 26-inch refractor at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Although Holden is credited with the discovery in the NGC, Wolfgang Steinicke found in the USNO observations for 1875 the entry "Jan. 11.  Nebula (nova).  In looking for Encke's Comet, found a vF, elongated nebula [alpha] = 23h 11m.4 [delta] = +3d 59.  T[uttle].".  There is nothing near his position.  In Die Herschel Nebel (1927), Karl Reinmuth states "not found, =N7541".  NGC 7541 is 3 minutes of RA west and 8' south of Tuttle's position, but there is a mag 12-13 star just east, which matches the NGC description.  So despite the very poor position this identification is possible.  See Harold Corwin's notes for more.

Strong concentration with an extremely bright elongated core and a prominent quasi-stellar nucleus.  This barred spiral is brighter along the spine of the major axis and displays a mottled or patchy surface brightness.  NGC 7582 is the largest and most impressive in the Grus Triplet with NGC 7590 5' NE and NGC 7599 12.5' NE.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 7582 = D 476 = h3977 on 7 Jul 1826 and recorded "a small faint round nebula, about 30" diameter: a double nebula follow this."  John Herschel made a single observation on 2 Sep 1836 and described "pB, L, pmE, gbM."  His declination is 15' too large.  DeLisle Stewart's corrected declination in the IC 2 notes (from Ann Harv Coll Obs, vol LX, p175) is accurate.


When Pietro Baracchi observed the field on 2 Nov 1885 with the Great Melbourne Telescope, he couldn't find NGC 7582 at Herschel's position, but instead picked up MCG -07-47-031, an uncredited discovery.

Since he only observed one of these galaxies on this date, it's reasonable to assume he picked up CGCG 406-047, as this is the brighter galaxy.  Marth probably found this galaxy again three months later on 29 Nov 1864 as m 568 = NGC 7605 but his RA was 1.0 tmin too large.  So, NGC 7583 = NGC 7603 = CGCG 406-047.  CGCG doesn't use the NGC designation and misidentifies CGCG 406-048 as NGC 7583.  This latter galaxy is probably NGC 7604.

48" (10/29/19): NGC 7592 is an interacting, merged pair with a separation of only 13"!  At 610x the western component (NGC 7592 W) appeared moderately bright, small, round, with a sharp stellar nucleus.  A low surface brightness tidal arm was attached on the west side and it hooked to the north.  The brighter eastern galaxy (NGC 7592 E) was fairly bright, fairly small, roundish, ~25" diameter, very bright core offset towards the north side.  A very small HII knot, 6"-8" diameter, called NGC 7592 S, is at the southwest end [13" from center].  A very low surface brightness halo extended further southwest of 7592 E and directly south of 7592 W.  This section is probably part of another tidal tail.


24" (8/23/14): at 375x appeared fairly faint, fairly small, irregular.  The component with the highest surface brightness is the core of the eastern galaxy (NGC 7592B = 7592E).  Most of the glow extended southwest (NGC 7592C = 7592S) and created an asymmetric appearance.  The nucleus of the western galaxy (NGC 7592A =7592W) appeared faint and extremely small, perhaps 5" diameter.  The arm or wing to its north was not seen.  The two nuclei are separated by only 13".  The nucleus of the third southern component, which wasn't seen, is probably a large HII clump in NGC 7592E.  The western galaxy has a Sy2 nucleus.


17.5" (8/7/91): faint, small, round.  NGC 7592A, a very faint and extremely small companion (only the nucleus was observed) attached at the west edge, was just resolved.  NGC 7585 lies 17' SW.  This is an interacting/colliding pair on the POSS with nuclei only 15" apart!

IC 5307 is extremely faint and small, round, 15" diameter, required averted to glimpse.  Faintest of four in the NGC 7594 group.


Andrew Ainslie Common discovered NGC 7594 = Nova #27 in August 1880 with his 36-inch reflector and recorded "Faint, round, following 3 stars in a line [with orientation] 90° pointing to another fainter nebula south."  His discovery position (estimated using setting circles) is ~6' southeast of UGC 12485, the brightest galaxy in a group and his description applies.  Bigourdan independently discovered this galaxy on 22 Aug 1889, measured an accurate position and catalogued it as Big. 239 (later IC 1478). Kobold also measured an accurate position in 1897.  All modern galaxy catalogues (as well as HyperLeda) identify this galaxy as IC 1478.


The "fainter nebula south" is IC 5306 (independently found by Kobold in 1897), and the northernmost of the "3 stars in line 90°" is IC 5305!  The two ICs, as well as IC 5307 were found by Kobold in 1897.  RC3, MCG, RNGC and DSFG misidentify IC 5306 as NGC 7594.  I noticed this identification while examining John Vickers' CCD Atlas.

30" (10/21/17 - OzSky): NGC 7599 is the third in the showpiece Grus Trio.  At 264x it appeared very bright, very large, elongated nearly 3:1 SW-NE, ~3.25'x1'. It was broadly concentrated but there was no distinct core or nucleus.  The surface brightness was uneven or mottled, though, likely due to spiral structure or dust.  The southwest end appeared more tapered and had a very faint extension at the tip, while the northeast side ends more abruptly.  A mag 14 star is superimposed on the north side, 0.8' NNE of center. A mag 12.8 star is off the east side, 1.5' from center.  NGC 7590 lies 5' WNW.


13.1" (11/5/83): extremely faint, fairly large, very elongated SW-NE, at visual threshold.  Located 4.9' ESE of NGC 7590.  Faintest of three nearly edge-on galaxies in the field (Grus Quartet including NGC 7552).  Observation hampered by very low elevation from Northern California.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 7599 = D 477.2 = h3981, along with NGC 7582, on 14 Jul 1826 and recorded "two very small round nebulae, nearly the same RA, and differing about 1' in polar distances."  John Herschel observed the pair of 2 Sep 1836 and logged "F; pmE; gbM; 3'; [the following of two]."


Harold Corwin notes that Lewis Swift's XI-227 = IC 5308, found on 8 Aug 1897 and described as "eeF; S; cE; f of 3; f of 7599.", is probably a duplicate observation.  Swift likely confused NGC 7590 as 7599 and assumed Sw. XI-227 was new.  See Corwin's historical notes.

The roundish halo gradually fades out around 1.0' diameter.  The beginning of a tidal arm is occasionally visible on the south side, extending a short distance to the southeast, but not reaching NGC 7603B.  The apparent companion, resides far in the background at a redshift distance of ~740 million ly.  It appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 0.3' diameter, very small brighter core, stellar nucleus.  A hint of the apparent bridge from NGC 7603 is just visible close west, but was not seen as connected.

Forms a close pair with NGC 7603B = PGC 71041 just 1' SE.  At 610x, the small companion is just outside the halo of NGC 7603 and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 20" diameter.

There is a long-standing redshift controversy with this pair first mentioned by Arp in ApL, 7, 221, 1971.  NGC 7603, the brighter galaxy, has a redshift z = .029 (~390 million ly) while its companion NGC 7603B has a much higher redshift z = .057, placing it about twice the distance (~740 million ly).  But there appears to be a luminous bridge connecting the objects that is easily visible on the DSS.  Also two quasars with much higher redshifts (z = .391 and z = .243) are embedded exactly on line of sight at the start and end of the bridge.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7604 = m 567, along with NGC 7605, on 29 Nov 1864 and noted "eF, vS, bM."  There is nothing at his position bright enough to have been seen, but exactly 1.0 minute of RA preceding is CGCG 406-048 = PGC 70974.  This galaxy is 3' north of NGC 7583.  Assuming Marth made the same 1.0 minute recording error for NGC 7605 = m 568 (observed on same night), then NGC 7605 matches NGC 7583.

Harold Corwin remarks that Bigourdan found this double again on 30 Oct 1886 and called it a "Small cluster 20 arcsec in diameter in which I can distinguish at least two stars, perhaps accompanied by a little nebulosity." His entry B. 240 in his 5th Comptes Rendus list became IC 1480, so NGC 7607 = IC 1480 = double star.  See Corwin's notes.

But Bindon Stoney probably made the original discovery on 30 Aug 1851 at Birr Castle, noting "I suspect 2 small nebula p[receding] h2330 [NGC 7619], though perhaps they are stars."  A sketch in the 1880 publication shows NGC 7617 at the correct orientation with a separation of 4'.  Because of his uncertainty, Stoney didn't receive credit in the NGC.

A low contrast dust lane wraps along the eastern edge of the core around to the south.  The dust lane continues slicing through the galaxy towards the west, cutting off a southern piece of the galaxy, which mimicks the appearance of a broad spiral arm.  A slightly brighter knot or patch is at the east end of this section, about 20" S of center.  The outer halo was slightly fainter on the southeast side.  Note: On the SDSS, there are two distinct, intersecting dust lanes, east and southwest of the core.

See observing notes for NGC 7641.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 7641 is uncertain.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7627 = Sw. VI-95 on 18 Nov 1886 and recorded "vF; S; vE; coarse double star near north; the double star is between 2 stars."  There is nothing near his position.  Herbert Howe mentions in his 1899-00 observations that "I failed to find this on two nights.  In reply to a letter of inquiry, Swift says that this is identical with 7641, one of Stephan's nebulae which I have measured.  With this opinion I agree, having seen near 7641 the "2 star n" mentioned by Swift."  Dreyer repeats this conclusion in the IC 2 appendix.  If NGC 7627 is identical to NGC 7641, then Swift's position is off by 1.6 tmin in RA (too far west) and 10' too far north.  His comment "vE" applies to this galaxy though the "coarse D * nr n; the D * is bet 2 stars" is not a good match. So this identification is uncertain.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

Dark lanes are suspected to the north with very faint nebulosity just north of this gap.  The main piece of nebulosity curves away from the involved star towards the east but appears brightest at the western edge near the bright star.

The main section hooks around the involved star to the east.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7635 = H IV-52 = h2235 on 3 Nov 1787 (sweep 773) and recorded "a bright star with F nebulosity; but I saw it too late to verify it, as in the north I cannot follow the stars.  I rather suspect a deception." On 26 Nov 1788 (sweep 887) he added "a star about 9m with vF nebulosity of very little extent."


Hubble considered NGC 7635 a giant planetary nebula in his 1922 paper "A general study of diffuse galactic nebulae."  Even in the early 1970's it was considered a possible or probable planetary (see ApJ, 167, 491-498 (1971)), though it was not included in Kohoutek's CGPN.


John Mallas coined the nickname "Bubble Nebula" in his Aug/Sep 1963 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebulae-VI", published in the "Review of Popular Astronomy".

17.5" (9/7/96): very faint, small, round, 30" diameter.  Similar size as IC 1483 = NGC 7638 but contains a very small brighter core that makes it a little easier to view.  Just preceding a small triangle of mag 12-14.5 stars.  Also collinear with a wide pair 5' SW near IC 1483.  Brightest in a trio with IC 1484 2.1' WNW and IC 1483 4.5' SW.


The identification of IC 1483 is certain but NGC 7639 is uncertain.


Andrew Ainslie Common discovered NGC 7639, along with NGC 7638, on 8 Aug 1880 while viewing comet Faye.  This is the last entry in his discovery list.  See notes for NGC 7630 and 7638.

24" (10/4/13): at 200x appeared bright, very large, nearly edge-on 4:1 N-S, ~6.5'x1.5'.  Very asymmetric appearance with a brighter, elongated core, 1.0'x0.5', which is oddly angled to the major axis in PA 20° (SSW-NNE).  A mag 14 star is just off the SE side of the core.  The galaxy dims more noticeably on the south side, but is brighter along the western half (DSS shows this is a long spiral arm).  A mag 11 star is just west of the northern end of the galaxy [3.1' NNW of center] and two mag 14.5-15 stars that are collinear with the mag 11 star are superimposed on the north side.  The northern half of the galaxy is also asymmetric with a slightly brighter strip (arm) extending N-S and a very low surface brightness (outer arm) near the mag 11 star.  Additional mag 11 stars bracket the galaxy just west of the south end and 1.8' NE of center.


17.5" (8/8/91): moderately bright, very large, very elongated 4:1 N-S, 7.0'x1.5'.  The large, slightly brighter middle bulges out a little.  A mag 13.5 star is at the SE edge of the core 33" from the center.  Bracketed by two mag 11 stars at the north end 3.0' NNW of center and just west of the south end 2.6' SSW of center.  An extremely faint mag 15 star is embedded near the north end.


8" (11/8/80): faint, large, very elongated streak N-S.  There are stars at both the north and south end.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7644 = Sw. V-100 on 29 Sep 1886 and recorded "vF, pS, lE."  There is nothing reasonably bright near his position and the description is too generic to be of help.  However, 74 seconds of RA due east is the double system NGC 7651, which Swift discovered earlier in the month on 1 Sep 1886 and placed correctly.  Most likely NGC 7644 is a second observation of NGC 7651.  Harold Corwin also suggests NGC 7643 as a possible candidate.  See his notes for more.


The RNGC misidentifies 2MFGC 17581 = PGC 1445975 as NGC 7644.  This is an edge-on galaxy situated  1.7' east-northeast of NGC 7651 and too faint to have been seen by Swift.

= **, Yann Pothier and Harold Corwin.  All modern catalogues equate NGC 7646 with IC 5318 at 23 24 06.9 -11 51 38.  My observation of this galaxy is below.


17.5" (8/25/95): very faint, very small, probably elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 30"x20".  The view is severely hindered by mag 11.5 star that is attached at the northwest end!  It was difficult to determine the dimensions and orientation due to glare from star and faintness of galaxy.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 7646 = LM 2-474 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory. He reported "mag 14.5; 0.2'x0.1', E 260°, neb?; *9 in PA 10° at 3.6' separation."  There is nothing near his rough position, though 8' north is IC 5318 = PGC 71338.  All modern catalogues identify this galaxy as NGC 7646, although NED comments the identification is uncertain.


Harold Corwin notes several inconsistencies with Muller's description; the elongation is NW-SE (not ~E-W) and the star at 3.6' separation is 10° west of north, not east.  A more serious omission, though, is that Muller makes no mention of the bright, superimposed star on the west side.  So, this identification is very unlikely.


In 2016, Yann Pothier suggested NGC 7646 is the double star at 23 24 32.3 -11 59 07.  Harold Corwin agrees this is a good candidate as the position angle of the pair matches Muller's estimate and a star is at the required separation and position angle matching Muller's description.

24" (9/2/16): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, 30"x25", gradually increases to the center.  With averted vision a very low surface brightness outer halo was detectable.


NGC 7647 is the brightest galaxy (cD) in AGC 2589, a richness class 0 cluster at a distance of ~560 million l.y.  Surrounding NGC 7647 is a large number of very faint galaxies with PGC 71331 (2.1' N), PGC 71337 (2.2' NE), PGC 71326 (1.7' S) and PGC 71317 (2.3' WSW), forming a small rectangle around the bright elliptical.  Additionally, I picked up PGC 71320 6.2' NNW, PGC 71324 8.4' N and CGCG 454-062 8.1' SSW.  These 7 additional members were very faint or extremely faint and generally 0.2' in size.


17.5" (9/26/92): extremely faint, very small, slightly elongated N-S.  A mag 13 star is 1.5' ENE.  Appears unusually faint for 15.2z due to low surface brightness.

Note: There is no mag 13.5 star to the ENE, so my observation may refer to another galaxy.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7647 = H III-473 on 29 Nov 1785 (sweep 480) and recorded "eF, cL, some doubt left.  It precedes an irregular row of scattered stars.  His RA is 10 seconds too small, but the description matches.

Stephen found this galaxy again on 3 Oct 1878 and reported it as new in list IX-38, though added a footnote it was identical to H III 218.  Finally, Bigourdan discovered it again on 1 Oct 1885, reported it as #241 in Comptes Rendus for 20 Apr 1891, and Dreyer recatalogued it as IC 1486, missing the equivalence with NGC 7648.

LEDA 95722, 2.6' SW of NGC 7649, is extremely faint, appears elongated SW-NE, 15"x10".  LEDA 1465051, 3.7' NNE of NGC 7649, is extremely faint, round, 10" diameter.  PGC 71356, 2.9' ESE of NGC 7649, is similar as well as MCG +02-59-037, 4.2' E.  LEDA 95729, 4.4' NE, is extremely faint, appears stellar at times, otherwise ~6" in diameter. CGCG 431-056, 5.2' ESE, is a bit larger and brighter than the previous galaxies and nearly spans between a pair of 14th-magnitude stars 20" SSW and 30" E.


17.5" (8/22/98): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, 0.9'x0.6'.  Located less than 3' SW of a mag 11 star. This galaxy was the brightest of four members viewed in AGC 2593 in Jim Shield's scope at 220x.


17.5" (7/19/90): faint, fairly small, almost round, weak concentration.  A mag 11 star is 2.8' ENE of center.  Brightest of five in the core of AGC 2593.  Surrounded by three anonymous galaxies 1.0' NE, 2.6' SW and 3.6' NNE and MCG +02-59-037 lies 5' ESE.  Located 9' N of mag 7.9 SAO 108595.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7649 = Sw. VI-96 on 25 Sep 1886 and recorded "vF; pL; R."  His position is barely off the west side of UGC 12579, the brightest member of AGC 2593.


Harold Corwin reports that Swift may have "discovered" this galaxy again on 15 Oct 1887 and reported Sw. IX-99 (later IC 1487) as "eeeF; pS; iR; 8m * f; faint star near nf; not [NGC 7653]."  His position is 15 seconds of RA east of NGC 7649 and happens to fall close to a much fainter galaxy in the cluster.  Just 1' further southeast is CGCG 431-056, which Howe assumed was IC 1487.  But NGC 7649 is a better match with Swift's comments of the two stars.  There are many cases where Swift listed the same galaxy twice in different or even the same list.  So IC 1487 is probably identical to NGC 7649.

ESO 605-006, 14' NE, was only occasionally glimpsed as an extremely faint glow, small, ~15" diameter, possibly elongated.  The trio is catalogued as KTS 72 (Karachentsev Triplets, South).


24" (8/23/14): fairly faint, fairly small, round, 20"-24" diameter, weak concentration.  The loop structure to the northeast was not noticed.  ESO 605-004 lies 13' WNW.


17.5" (10/21/95): very faint, small, round, 30" diameter.  Contains a very small brighter core surrounded by a very faint halo.  This is an unusual, distorted interacting system with loops and filaments, though no structure was seen.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 7656 = LM 1-263 on 9 Oct 1885 and recorded "vF; vS; R; bMN."  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), but approximately 1 minute of RA west is ESO 605-005 = PGC 71357.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1897-98 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).  Bigourdan couldn't find this object, probably looking at the wrong position.

18" (10/25/08): difficult observation due to low altitude and faintness of this double system.  This is the southern "knot" of two extremely faint glows (separation 40") that were occasionally visible. Too faint for any details.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7658 = h3994 on 4 Sep 1834 and recorded "double nebula; individuals equal; eF; R; bM; 20"; follows a line of 4 stars at 11 and 12m, somewhat oblique to the meridian.  He confirmed the description on 4 Oct 1836, though for some reason he only assigned a single h- and GC-designation.  So, we have NGC 7658A and 7658B.

V = 8.3;  Size 32"x28"


48" (10/24/14): superb view of the double-shell structure at 610x and 813x.  The inner shell is elongated ~3:2 SW-NE, ~18"x12", and contains a remarkable, bright thin rim, so it appears like a racetrack with a dark interior.  This delicate but high surface brightness ring is brightest along a 90° arc around the northeast end and nearly as bright in a matching 90° arc on the southwest end.  The rim is noticeably weaker on the west and east sides.  The elongated darker hole spans a large percentage of the inner shell and is punctuated by a faint, but steadily visible central star.


The outer shell is twice the size (~35"x25"), slightly less elongated, and a bit offset in its major axis (SSW-NNE).  The outer rim also has two brighter arcs or strips, but only 25°-30° in length.  The more prominent arc is on the southeast side with a weaker strip symmetrically placed on the northwest edge.  These strips are 90° offset from the much brighter inner arcs.  The outer shell appears irregular in surface brightness with an impression of striations.  Surrounding the outer shell there appears to be a very low surface brightness outer halo.


18" (9/10/07): viewed this gorgeous double-shelled planetary at 807x in good seeing.  The outer envelope is a sharply defined 35"x25" oval, oriented SSW-NNE.  Roughly halfway to the center is a remarkable, thin oval ring oriented SW-NE (slightly offset in orientation compared to the outer shell) of very high surface brightness.  This annular ring is brightest along a 90° arc on the south side and is also enhanced along a shorter arc along the northern part of the ring.  The ring fades and appears broken with a gap along the west to WNW edge.  Inside the ring is a darker oval hole that is weakly luminous.


18" (10/19/06): In steady seeing, the double-shell structure was remarkable at 807x (7mm Pentax + 2.5x Powermate).  The outer envelope is noticeably oval SW-NE, ~35"x25".  Embedded within this envelope is a fairly thin, very bright inner ring with a sharply defined outline.  The ring was irregular in surface brightness but clearly brightest at the SW and NE ends of the ring (ends of the major axis).  The ring fades on the NW side and there was a small, distinct gap in the ring at the NW end. The surface brightness of the inner ring was high enough to give a glowing "electric" quality with an impression of a rope-like or twisted structure.  The center of the ring was much darker than the ring and formed a substantial dark oval at this magnification, but was still clearly luminous.


17.5" (10/13/01): at 500x, this blue high surface brightness planetary has a beautiful double-shell structure with a small, dark center.  The bright inner structure has a delicate, embedded thinner ring of very high surface brightness, though weaker at the following end.  In the center of this ring is a small, darker hole.  The fainter, outer envelope is elongated SW-NE, ~35"x25", giving an asymmetric appearance with the outline of the inner ring.


17.5" (10/12/85): extremely bright, very high surface brightness, fairly small, easily takes very high power.  At 410x, the planetary appears weakly annular with a slightly darker center.  There is a second outer shell, which exhibits subtle structure due to an irregular surface structure, blue-green color is evident.  Central star not seen.


13" (9/11/82): darker center, faint outer shell.


8" (9/25/81) : slightly darker center at 300-400x, irregular surface brightness.


William Herschel discovered NGC 7662 = H IV-18 = h2241 on 6 Oct 1784 (during sweeps 281-285, which was made in the east) and noted "bright, round, a planetary [with a] pretty well defined disk, 15" diameter with a 7 feet reflector."  In his 1811 PT paper, he write "A beautifully bright round nebula, have a pretty well defined disk of about 10 or 12" in diameter.  It is a little elliptical, and has a very small star following, which gives us the idea of a small satellite accompanying its planet [from 3 Oct 1790, sweep 964].  It is visible in a common finder as a small star."  This may be the first time "planetary" is actually used although earlier, Darquier describes M57 "... as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet."


On 1 Oct 1828, John Herschel recorded "A fine planetary nebula.  Diameter 12"; with 240 beautifully defined, light, rather mottled, and the edge the least in the world unshaped.  It is not nebulous, but looks as if had a double outline, or like a star a little out of focus.  A perfect circle."  JH measured the 13th magnitude star ~50" NE of center several times (interested in it as a possible satellite of the planetary) and noted "These satellites of planetary nebulae out to be especially attended to."


32 observations were made with Lord Rosse's 72".  It was first observed by Rosse and Johnstone Stoney on 31 Oct 1848, "Has a central spot, at moments very dark."  Lord Rosse and Stoney made sketches on 16 Dec 1848 revealing the double ring structure and brighter arcs (1850 publication, Fig 13, Plate XXXVIII).  Bindon Stoney's sketch on 16 Sep 1852 using a freshly polished speculum shows a prominent central star within a spiral shaped nebula and well-defined "arms".


Using a 9.5" refractor in 1855, Father Secchi described (and sketched) a slightly darker horseshoe-shaped central region and a brighter outer arc, a questionable amount of detail for that aperture.  Joseph Winlock and George Searle, observing with the HCO 15-inch refractor around 1866, did not report the central star but "Two edges seen...as of a brighter nebula placed over a dimmer one.  The brighter and fainter ellipses have major axes slightly differing in direction; the brighter having the position angle of its major axis 10° to 15° the large"


Barnard thought the central star was variable based on observations with the Yerkes 40-inch in 1897 and wrote a paper in 1908 on "The Variability of the Nucleus of the Planetary Nebula NGC 7662" (MNRAS, 68, 465).  The paper includes a superb sketch made with the 40-inch refractor at Yerkes.  In 1935, John Duncan wrote "The bright ring of NGC 7662, like that of NGC 6720, has a vivid bluish-green color; but the outer shell, seen with a large reflector [probably with the 60"] on a favorable night, has a pronounced reddish hue."


The nickname "Blue Snowball" is from Leland S. Copeland’s description (1960), "looking like light blue snowball.”

This barred Magellanic irregular (possible merger) contains a series of blue HII knots along the west side and three were seen at 488x.  A very faint stellar or quasi-stellar knot (UM 160 NED1) is detached off the west end.  A slightly brighter tiny knot (UM 160 NED2) is close ESE [by 15"], at the west edge of the galaxy.  A third collinear knot (UM 160 NED3), 15" further ESE, was intermittently visible.  The NED designations are from the University of Michigan emission line survey.

John Herschel discovered NGC 7674 = h2243, along with NGC 7675, on 16 Aug 1830 and reported "F; R; gbM; 30".  The p of 2 [with NGC 7675]."  Samuel Hunter observed the pair as an assistant at Birr Castle on 30 Sep 1862 and described "Two neb p and f; preceding one [NGC 7674] is double, north-south, north component may only be a * enveloped in nebulosity".  The "north component" is MCG +01-59-081 = HCG 96C and if Hunter was more certain, this object would likely have received a NGC designation.  The MCG misidentifies MCG +01-59-081 as NGC 7674 and NGC 7674 itself is mislabeled as NGC 7675.

Contains and small bright core and an extremely bright, very small nucleus with a pinpoint stellar peak.  The core is elongated WNW-ESE and appeared as a weak bar. A bright thin arm was nearly attached on the east side of the "bar" and swung counterclockwise to the south of the core.  This arm was sharply defined and brightened significantly on the southwest end [~30" SW of center].   The northern arm was only visible at its root near the west end of the "bar" as well as a small, detached piece on the northeast side of the halo [30" NE of center].   The galaxy sits within a bright isosceles triangle of mag 11/12 stars.  The observation was made in good seeing but through thin clouds.

At 260x the galaxy is beautifully framed with a thin triangle of mag 11.3/11.4 stars to the north and a mag 12 star off the south end.  It appeared fairly bright, moderately large, elongated SW-NE, ~1.8'x1.3'.  Contains a brighter elongated core that increases to a very small brighter nucleus.  The "heavy arm" is visible on the south side as a thin, shallow arc in the outer halo and brightens right at its western tip.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7678 = H II-226 = h2245 on 15 Sep 1784 (sweep 274) and recorded "F, pL, bM, elliptical, between an acute triangle of pretty considerable stars."  On sweep 91, JH described this object as "F; vR [sic?]; pL; lbM; very symmetrically situated in the southern part of a lozenge of 4 stars, on the longer diagonal, forming an elegant object."  He included a sketch in the Slough catalogue (fig. 85).


On 5 Nov 1850, Lord Rosse's assistant George Johnstone Stoney reported "I saw two knots and a dark space between them [gap between nucleus and southern arm].  I think the nebula is connected above the dark space."  R.J. Mitchell, observing in 1854, noted "spirality distinctly seen.  I thought the coil double in more closely upon itself than shown in Mr. Stoney's drawing, and that the central knot had a stellar nucleus.  The whole nebula looked sparkling, though I could not see any separate stars."

Albert Marth discovered NGC 7695 = m 581 on 18 Nov 1864 and noted "eF, stell, very near III. 187 [NGC 7694]."  His position is within 1' of PGC 71726, situated 1.1' south of NGC 7694, so the identification is certain despite the faintness of this galaxy.

The galaxy is at the eastern vertex of a triangle with a mag 11 star 4' SW and a mag 12.5 star 3.5' NW.  Also a mag 14.3 star is 1.7' ENE, along with a 15.2 star 1.6' ESE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7697 = h3998 on 6 Sep 1836 and recorded "eeF; pL; 40"; very difficult but certain".  His position in the CGH catalogue is accurate, but his declination in the GC is 9' too far south.  Then Dreyer made another clerical error and his NGC RA was 3.0 minutes too large.  He later mentioned the misprint and corrected the RA in the IC 2 Notes.


DeLisle Stewart found this galaxy again in 1900 on an Arequipa plate and reported IC 5533 = HN 784 as "cB, S, edge of plate, susp."  His position is off by only 1.5'.  So, NGC 7697 = IC 5533 = ESO 110-012.  PGC and HyperLEDA identify ESO 110-012 as IC 5333 only.  RC3 misidentifies ESO 110-014 as NGC 7697.  ESO-LV identifies both ESO 110-012 and ESO 110-014 as NGC 7697.  RNGC classifies this number as a galaxy but reported the erroneous NGC position!  So, there are numerous identification missteps.

This deformed, interacting Wolf-Rayet galaxy is dominated by an extremely bright stellar nucleus (starburst activity).  A short bar-like central region is elongated NNW-SSE.  A curved arm bends sharply west on the south end of the "bar" and contains a very small knot (southwest of the nucleus).  A second arm, which appears to consist of a series of HII knots on the SDSS, begins on the NNW end of the "bar" and extends a short distance northeast.  A low surface brightness halo appears as a hazy glow on the eastern side only [a tidal loop on the SDSS].

48" (10/26/16): at 610x; fairly bright, moderately large, thin edge-on 6:1 WSW-ENE.  Dominated by a small, bright elongated core ~20"x8" that increases to a star-like nucleus.  Long stretched tidal arms or plumes extend WSW-ENE, ~1.8'x0.3'.  The western "arm" heads towards the center of NGC 7714 [1.9' W], but dims out before reaching the halo.  Mag 5.7 16 Psc is just 3.3' S and the glare affected viewing unless moved off the field.


[HB89] 2333+019, a faint distant quasar, lies 2.6' NE of the center of NGC 7715.  At a redshift of z = 1.871, the light-travel time is 10.2 billion years.  It was generally visible with averted vision despite a V magnitude of 18.3.  The quasar wasn't our target - Jimi noticed it on his monitor when we were observing NGC 7714/15, so of course Howard, Jimi and I had to take a look and we were pleased it was readily visible.


24" (8/30/16): at 322x; fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 4:1 WSW-ENE.  Contains a brighter core and low surface brightness extensions (arms) that increase in size with averted vision to ~1.4'x0.35'.  On images the western arm or tidal bridge stretches to brighter NGC 7714 1.8' W, though there was no visual connection.  Located 3' N of mag 5.7 16 Psc!


17.5" (8/7/91): very faint, very small, elongated 2:1 WSW-ENE.  Located 3.2' N of mag 5.7 16 Psc, which detracts from viewing.  Forms a close pair (Arp 284) with much brighter NGC 7714 1.8' W.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 7715 on 4 Nov 1850.  While maing an observation of NGC 7714 he noticed "a faint neb follows [NGC 7714] about 2'."  Dreyer measured an accurate position in 1876 using the offset from 16 Psc.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7720 = H III-146 = h2259 on 10 Sep 1784 (sweep 264) and recorded "vF, E, small stars with nebulosity between."  There is nothing at his position, but 36 seconds of time west is UGC 12716. JH described this galaxy as "pF; R; bM; 20"." and measured an accurate RA.  Herbert Howe reported in his 1900 paper on NGC/IC observations that "there seems to be a small nest of nebulae clustered about this one.  I have measured two, and suspected some others.  An examination with a large telescope might be fruitful.  7720 is described as "lE, bM."  It looks like a nebulous double star of mag 12-13.5, angle 10° [NNE], and distance 10"."  So Howe clearly resolved the two components of NGC 7720.

There is nothing at his position (14' east-southeast of NGC 7720), but the number probably applies to one of the galaxies within the galaxy cluster Abell 2634.


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 7726 = UGC 12721, though notes some inconsistencies.  Swift's position is 19 seconds of RA east and 8' south of this galaxy.  Swift mentions a "pB* nr foll".  A mag 9 star is due east, but it follows by 9'.  Also a mag 10 star is only 2.6' southwest of UGC 12721 and it seems likely this star would have been noted instead.  On the other hand, NGC 7728 is 11' east-northeast in agreement with the description, though it certainly doesn't appear "very elongated".  Corwin was unable to find another more likely candidate, so this identification is very uncertain.


The RNGC and RC3 misidentifies IC 5342 as NGC 7726. This galaxy is just 2.5' southeast of NGC 7720.  I called NGC 7726 nonexistent in RNGC Corrections #4, but my comments were revised in RNGC Corrections #6.

The GC Supplement and NGC position, though, is about 50 seconds further east based on a position communicated directly to Dreyer.

The ESO identifies ESO 606-002 = MCG -04-55-22 as NGC 7730.  This galaxy is 17' south and 36 seconds west of his "corrected" position. Furthermore, with a magnitude of B_t = 14.8 this galaxy is pretty faint, so I doubt Tempel would refer to it as a "good [Herschel] class II".

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 7736 = LM 1-265 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.   He reported "mag 15.0; eS; gbM; bet 2 st 12m."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is just 15 seconds of RA too large.  This galaxy is between two mag 14 stars 1.8' NNW and 2.9' SSE so the identification is certain. Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1897-98 with the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.

His position is 4' northwest the center of UGC 12754.  Heinrich d'Arrest observed the galaxy on 6 nights (first on 1 Sep 1864), noted the error in WH's position, and accurately measured the offset to the double star off the northwest side.


Édouard Stephan independently discovered this galaxy on 25 Oct 1881, also measured an accurate micrometric position and recorded "eF, fairly large, irr oval, elong E to W, two points of condensation."  In the remarks section at the end of the list, Stephan notes this object is identical to GC 5005 [NGC 7741], but WH's position was poor.  Perhaps while preparing his manuscript, he read d'Arrest's observations.  The 10 Dec 1873 observation at Birr Castle reads "cB, L, mE 108°, much diffused neby south and following, which Lord Rosse suspected to be divided into branching [spiral] arms."

Strongly concentrated with a bright core that increased to an intense nucleus.  A faint star (mag 16.5?) was visible close southwest of the nucleus.


A spiral arm is connected to the east side of the core, though wasn't separated initially from the central region. It rotated sharply clockwise to the north, and was well defined as it passed directly through a mag 15 star on the north side of the halo. The arm faded as it separated away from the center and gradually curved south on the west side of the galaxy.  The arm faded out just east of a mag 16.9 star [1.7' SW of center], before reaching companion NGC 7752, 2.0' SW of center.


The southern spiral arm emerged from the east or northeast side of the core.  It curled tightly clockwise to the south and passed barely inside a mag 14.5 star.  The arm was brightest in a strip near this star and then faded as it rotated to the east side of the galaxy.

Frank Muller discovered NGC 7758 = LM 2-475 in 1886 and reported "mag 15.5; 0.3' dia; irr R; sbM; double star mag 10, north following 50 seconds."  His position is fairly accurate and the double star is HJ 3218.

The 45" outer halo has a low surface brightness.  A mag 14.8 star is 1.6' SSE.  NGC 7759A = MCG -03-60-019 is attached at the east edge of the halo.  The companion appeared extremely faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, ~20"x7".


17.5" (9/26/92): fairly faint, very small, round, bright core, almost stellar nucleus.  Located 2.8' S of a mag 9.5 star.  Forms a pair with NGC 7754 6' SE.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 7759 = LM 1-267, along with NGC 7754, on 28 Nov 1885 and noted "mag 14.0; vS; R."  His rough position falls just 1' south of MCG -03-60-018.  Curiously, his RA is 1 minute larger than NGC 7754, though NGC 7759 is actually west.  The relatively bright mag estimate (14.0) secures this identification.


Lewis Swift found the galaxy again in 1886 and communicated the discovery directly to Dreyer, who referenced Swift's 6th discovery list, which was in preparation when the NGC went to press.  But Swift didn't published the rediscovery in either his 6th or later 9th list, possibly due to Leavenworth's earlier discovery.  Howe measured a very accurate micrometric position in 1899-00.  The identifications of NGC 7754 and 7759 are reversed on the Uranometria 2000 Atlas, placing them in RA order.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7760 = H III-854 = h2271 on 9 Oct 1790 (sweep 971) and recorded "two very small close stars, with seeming nebulosity between them.  360 confirmed it nearly."  On sweep 975, he was more certain, "the 2 close stars affected with nebulosity of the 971 sweep.  360 confirmed it."

JH made a total of 5 observations and generally recorded this object as a faint double or triple star possibly with nebulosity, though one was clearly the nucleus.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 7761 = LM 1-268 in 1886 at Leander McCormick Observatory and noted "mag 13.0; vS; R; gbM; *10 precedes 8.0'."  There is nothing near his rough (nearest min of RA) position, though 2 minutes of time east is MCG -02-60-020 = PGC 72641.  A mag 11 star is 7' west, matching the description, though another mag 11 star is only 3.5' west.


Guillaume Bigourdan independently found this galaxy again (Big. 356) on 30 Nov 1891 and measured an accurate position.  Herbert Howe found it a third time on 1 Oct 1897, measured a very accurate micrometric position, and included it in his first discovery list. Dreyer combined Bigourdan and Howe's observations into IC 5361.  So, NGC 7761 = IC 5361.  See Corwin's notes for discussion.

A second observation was made the next night.  In his 1814 PT paper he speculated "this appearance may be accounted for by supposing, for instance, three, four or a greater number of preponderating attracting centres near each other, situated so as to enclose a certain space, the stars in which, then, cannot be accumulated, while the clustering power arising from the combined attractions with be exerted on the surrounding stars."  JH made the single observation "a vL, v coarse, rather poor cluster of *s 11...15m.  The most compressed part taken."

William Herschel noticed NGC 7770 on 18 Sep 1784 (sweep 277) in his discovery of NGC 7771.  He commented, "towards the sp part [of NGC 7771] seems to be a vS stellar nebula within the nebulosity of the large one, but it may be only a small star."  Due to his uncertainty he didn't assign NGC 7770 an internal discovery number or H-designation, so received no later credit.


John Herschel independently found this galaxy on 25 Aug 1827 while observing NGC 7771.  His description on sweep 91 reads, "pB; E; bM; has a vS almost stellar nebula about 45° sp, dist 40"."  On the following sweep, he made a sketch and noted "... has a smaller neb, 60° sp, 35" dist."  Wolfgang Steinicke mentions that JH used object class "N2" (two nebulae), so it's surprising he didn't assign NGC 7770 a separate designation in the Slough or General Catalog.  As a result, JH received no credit in the GC or NGC.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 7770 agaom on 5 Nov 1850 while observing NGC 7769 and 7771.  A sketch of the trio was included in the 1861 publication (NGC 7770 is labeled Gamma). A more accurate sketch from 1855 is on plate V of the 1880 publication.  Lord Rosse is credited with the discovery of NGC 7770 in the GC and NGC.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 7776 = LM 1-270 on 31 Oct 1885 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and noted "mag 15.0; vS; lE 315; gbM; near #268 [NGC 7761]."  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), but Harold Corwin examined his field sketch and found it matches MCG -02-60-022 = PGC 72812.  This galaxy is 1.6 min of RA east of Stone's position and 12' south.  Johann Palisa independently discovered this galaxy on 19 Sep 1893 with the 27" refractor at Vienna and it was recatalogued as IC 1514.  So, NGC 7776 = IC 1514.  MCG uses the IC designation.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 7780 = St XII-96 on 18 Oct 1881.  Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy in 1886 and communicated the discovery directly to Dreyer.  Dreyer referenced Swift's 4th discovery list, though he probably meant his 6th list which was under preparation when the NGC was published.  But Swift didn't include it in either his 6th or later 9th list, which included several objects Swift discovered prior to the publication of the NGC.  Perhaps Swift became aware of Stephan's prior discovery, though a few other objects nevery appeared in his dozen lists.

Harold Corwin agrees with my identification, and notes "Aside from the possibility of a systematic offset in Marth's positions on the night he found the galaxy, there is no reason to suppose that he didn't see UGC 12847.  We will check the possibility of a systematic error in other of Marth's positions measured on the same night.  I am reasonably confident that the earlier cataloguers did not make this check, so am reassigning the NGC number to what is undoubtedly the galaxy that Marth actually saw."

48" (10/31/13): bright showpiece galaxy, very large, oval 3:2 E-W, ~7'x4.5', large bright core.  Spiral structure was evident, though it was difficult to trace individual arms except for one better defined arm attached on the west side of the core.  This arm sweeps towards the east on the south side of the core (~2' from center) and ends just east of center.  The halo appeared lumpy with an irregular surface brightness and several HII knots/associations were visible.  The brightest individual knot is [H69] #20 from Paul Hodge's 1969 paper "HII Regions in 20 Nearby Galaxies".  This fairly faint, 10" knot was easily seen 1.5' S of center, near the south side of the halo.  [H69] #27, a slightly smaller and fainter patch is near the west-northwest end of the halo (1.9' from center).  On the west-southwest side of the halo were two additional close, faint knots, both ~8" in diameter; [H69] #32 situated 2.3' from center and [H69] #33 at 2.4' from center.  Finally, [H69] #3/5 is a fairly faint, 15" patch near the northeast edge of the halo, 2.8' from center.  A mag 12.5 star is just off the northern edge, 2.9' from center.


30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 303x; most of the detail seen in the 48" was visible, but the HII regions were not as obvious.  The galaxy extended roughly 8' x 5' WNW-ESE and contained a relatively large core region that gradually brightened towards the center.  Although the halo appeared mottled and ragged, spiral structure was subtle.  A very low contrast "arm" extends due west on the northwest side of the core and another "arm" appeared to extend east on the southeast side of the core.  I noted 4 HII regions: the most obvious is [H69] 20, a faint, 10" knot near the south edge of the halo, ~1.5' from center.  [H69] 3/5, a larger, very diffuse isolated patch, perhaps 20" in size, was seen on the northeast edge of the halo, 2.9' from center.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 7793 = D 608 = HN 4 on 14 Jul 1826 and recorded a "faint round nebula, about 2' diameter, with a very slight condensation towards the centre; a double star is north preceding" (2 observations).  His position is 14' too far east (typical error).  Apparently John Herschel didn't observe this galaxy from South Africa.


George Bond independently found the galaxy on 7 Nov 1850 at Harvard College Observatory with a 4" comet-seeker and announced it as a new discovery.  Bond is credited with the discovery in the NGC.  His RA is 40 seconds too large though he mentioned his position required further confirmation. Since John Herschel didn't include NGC 7793 in the GC (possibly because of Bond's comment) but Dreyer added it to the GC Supplement (6233).  An accurate position from the Cordoba D.M was stated in the IC 1 notes.


Based on a photograph taken with the 30" Reynolds reflector at the Helwan Observatory between 1912-14, Harold Knox-Shaw first identified this galaxy as an "open spiral, knotty and complex."  A later plate revealed a "bright sharp stellar nucleus" and "very many knots and patches."

17.5" (12/20/95): scattered group of two dozen stars in a 10' diameter mostly north and east of mag 6.5 HD 224404.  Most stars are mag 11-13 (with one brighter mag 9.5 star) and only a few faint members.  There are two mag 9 stars 4' and 6' S of the mag 6.5 star but these are really detached from the group.  The brighter mag 11 stars form a boxy outline and there is circular hole void of stars in the center.  This asterism is only noticeable at 100x and 220x because of the mag 6.5 star and the group is somewhat detached in the field.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7795 = h2287 on 29 Sep 1829 and recorded "A star 7m, the chief of a vL coarse scattered but poor cl which fills the field.  Stars 10m."  There is no bright star near his (single) position, but exactly 1.0 minute of RA preceding is mag 6.5 SAO 35922.  The DSS shows a good scattering of fairly bright stars nearby, mainly to the north.  RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent, using the incorrect NGC position.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (10/29/11): this number refers to the fainter northeast component of a 20" pair of mag 13.6/14.4 stars.  The pair was easily resolved at 225x and there was no hint of a nebulous image.  Another 13" pair (with a 3rd component squeezed between) lies 3' SW.  Located 13' NW of mag 8 HD 224769.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 7799 on 7 Nov 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His single observation mentions a mag 16 star is southwest by 20" and at his position on the DSS is a 21" pair of stars oriented southwest-northeast.  So, d'Arrest must have thought the northeast component was slightly nebulous.  Coincidentally his position is 9 seconds of RA east of UGC 12882, an extremely faint edge-on (too faint to have been seen by d'Arrest).  RNGC, PGC, Megastar and probably other amateur software misidentify UGC 12882 as NGC 7799. NED and HyperLeda identify NGC 7799 as a star.

18" (11/17/08): this 10" unequal pair of faint stars was resolved at 175x and easily split at 325x.  Located 3' N of a pale orange/blue-white pair (Du 4 = 9.6/10.2 at 15").  A third mag 10 star lies just 1.4' ESE of the closer pair.


This erroneous NGC entry is from Schweizer (Observations de Moscou, II, 115).  But in four observations Engelhardt could only see a double star without nebulosity  and the region was carefully examined by Burnham (Publ of Lick Obs, II) on two nights and only a faint pair was found: "but there was no trace of nebulosity about it, or anywhere in the vicinity."  He measured the separation (1891) as 9.8" in PA 55.6°.


Kaspar Gottfried Schweizer, director of the Moscow Observatory, discovered NGC 7804 on 22 Oct 1860.  The discovery wasn't published until 1875 (Observations de Moscou, II, 115).  At his exact position is a pair of mag 14 stars at 10" separation.  In four observations Engelhardt could only find this double star and no nebulosity (micrometric position given).  Sherburne Burnham also carefully examined the region (Publ of Lick Obs, II) on two nights and only the faint pair was found, "but there was no trace of nebulosity about it, or anywhere in the vicinity."  He measured the separation (1891) as 9.8" in PA 55.6°.  Finally, Reinmuth says "no neb; double star 13 and 14 alm cont 50°".

There is nothing at his position, but 1.0 minute east is MCG -02-01-016 = PGC 287.  His description has several inconsistencies: his position angle is well off from 158°, a mag 11-12 star follows by 25 seconds (his estimates were often a couple of mags too bright) and a mag 8 star precedes by 40 seconds.  Still, there are no other reasonable candidates nearby.  Herbert Howe found this galaxy again in 1899 while searching for Muller's object and assumed it was new because of the inconsistencies listed above, and it was recatalogued as IC 5384.  So, NGC 7813 is perhaps identical to IC 5384, but not with certainty.


MCG labels this galaxy as IC 5384.  Roger Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 and the Deep Sky Field Guide both give the wrong position (based on the NGC position).  See Corwin's notes.

48" (10/23/11): gorgeous view of this showpiece edge-on spiral at 375x and 488x.  The oval central bulge was large and very bright, increasing to an intense core.  A very thin, very high contrast dust lane sliced through the major axis of the galaxy, neatly bisecting the galaxy.  On close inspection, the halo on the south side of the lane was marginally more extensive.  At the center, a small nucleus is apparently obscured, leaving only two very small brilliant "knots" on either side of the lane.  Beyond the central region, much fainter arms extend NW and SE, increasing the total size to 5'x1.5'.  The dust lane was easily visible splitting the edge-on arms until they dimmed out at the tips.


17.5" (8/2/86): very bright, very bright large core, fainter extensions NW-SE.  Forms a pair with IC 5381 10' S.  The narrow dust lane bisecting the galaxy was not seen.  IC 5378 (Arp 130) lies 30' NNW.

William Herschel discovered NGC 7814 = H II-240 = h2297 on 8 Oct 1784 (sweep 286) and logged "pF; pL; irr R; easily res."  John Herschel made the single observation "B; L; irreg R; vgbM; 2' or 3' diam; no nucleus."  R.J. Mitchell, LdR's assistant on 12 Oct 1885, wrote "pL and B, E, gmbM, a decided dark lane runs through it in the direction of the major axis.  The neb is rather narrower in the middle of its length and spreads out laterally towards its extremities, fading away gradually.  His sketch was included in the 1861 publication and in Plate 5, Fig 11 in the 1880 Lawrence Parsons publication.  The sketch shows the thin dust lane bisecting the core and extending out through the arms.

NGC 7822 = Ced 215 = LBN 587 = LBN 589

00 03 18 +68 30; Cep

Size 60'x30'


18" (9/15/07): at 73x (31mm Nagler) unfiltered, extends nearly 60' in length (roughly E-W).  A group of stars are involved near the middle and includes a nice isosceles triangle of mag 8/8/9 stars with separations of 2.7', 2.7' and 4' with several fainter stars nearby.  This group is clearly encased in nebulosity and extends to the east for nearly 30' with quite a few stars involved.  Fainter nebulosity also extends to the west in a wide curving lane.  The entire glow shows up well at 12.5x in the 80mm finder.  Did not experiment with filters.


17.5" (8/25/95): very faint, very large nebulosity best viewed in the 16x80 finder as it gives a higher contrast with the surrounding sky.  Appears elongated E-W and at least 40' in size.  At 82x, nebulosity is clearly visible in the region of a triangle of mag 8-9 stars including mag 7.9 SAO 20996 at 00 00 57.5 +68 27 27 (2000).  A large portion of the field appears weakly nebulous, though not with certainty.


The identification of NGC 7822 is uncertain and may apply to Ced 214 about 1.5 degrees to the south.  Here are my descriptions for Ced 214 = Sh 2-171:

18" (9/15/07): at 73x (31mm Nagler) unfiltered, Ced 214 appears as a huge, faint, irregular glow of at least 50' diameter surrounding mag 5.7 HD 225216.  Extends as far south as mag 6.3 HD 225136 (28' S of the mag 5.7 star).  The NW portion includes open cluster Be 59 (~20' NW of the mag 5.7 star).  Generally, the outline can be traced, though it is only vaguely defined in some areas.  The east side has a roughly circular outline.  Did not compare the view using a UHC or H-beta filter, although despite the previous negative result it was immediately evident without a filter.  On deep images, Ced 214 and the elongated section to the north (often taken as NGC 7822) are connected and part of a huge loop extending off the west and east side of Ced 214 and curving to the north.


17.5" (10/4/97): Ced 214 was not detected unfiltered at 82x or using an OIII filter.  With an H-Beta filter, a 40' field surrounding the mag 5.7 illuminating star appeared weakly nebulous in contrast to the immediate periphery.  No structure noted, although seemed roughly circular.  The small open cluster Be 59 is embedded on the NW side.  This object may be NGC 7822 if John Herschel made a 1.5 degree error in declination.


John Herschel discovered NGC 7822 = h2302 on 16 Nov 1829 and recorded "the central part of what I am positive is an enormously L, but eF neb of a round figure, though I cannot trace its limits.  Diam 10'±.  The night exquisite.  I swept often across it to be sure, but always recurred to the same place.  No doubt but can never be seen but in the best state of the air and sky. Diameter 10' +/-."   Herschel's position is just north of the 60'x30' nebula described here, though it is not of a "round figure".  Two unsuccessful obsesrvations were made with LdR's 72", probably due to the size.


Isaac Roberts gave dimensions of 42'x38' in MNRAS, Vol LXIII, p301 based on plates taken in 1901 and 1902, although his description (as well as possibly JH's) refers to Ced 214 = Sh 2-171, about 1.5° south of JH's position (part of the same complex).  Dreyer repeated Robert's dimensions in the IC 2 Notes section.  Harold Corwin's favors identifying Robert's nebula as NGC 7822, with Ced 215 (close to JH's position) as a secondary choice.  Either are possible, but as JH didn't mention the mag 5.7 star involved in Ced 214, I prefer Ced 215.

A double star (mag 10/11.5 at 30" in pa 45°) located 10' E forms an equilateral triangle with the endpoints of the string.  The asterism stands out in field because of the brighter stars.

In the Arp catalogue, NGC 7828 has a very unusual distorted appearance.  According to Higdon (1988), this is not a classical ring but possibly the result of stripping of the gaseous disk from a spiral galaxy during the collision with an intergalactic HI cloud.  It was rejected as a ring galaxy in "Stellar Disks of Collisional Ring Galaxies" (AJ 136, 1259,2008) by Romano et al.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7831 = Sw. II-1 on 20 Sep 1885.  His description reads, "eF; vS; eE; bright star south; vF star very near."  There is nothing at his position, but 62 seconds of RA east and 8' north is UGC 60.  Similar offsets in RA and Dec yield identities for NGC 19, NGC 21 and NGC 7836, all discovered the same night (NGC 6 also shares the same offset in RA).  Furthermore, his comment of a "bright star south" matches mag 8.9 SAO 53654 located 2.2' S and "vF star very near" matches a mag 14 star at the southwest end 45" from center, so this identification is certain.


Bigourdan couldn't find NGC 7831 at Swift's position so when he rediscovered UGC 60 he assumed it was new and Dreyer catalogued Big. 357 as IC 1530.  CGCG, UGC, MCG label this galaxy as IC 1530 because of the unambiguous IC position, though Swift's number should apply by prior discovery.

18" (10/21/06): extremely faint, very small, appears elongated 2:1 ~N-S but only 0.4'x0.2', very low surface brightness.  Located 3.4' E of a mag 12.5 star in the NGC 3 group.  NGC 7834 lies 4' SW and NGC 7837/7838 5' SE.


17.5" (8/2/86): very faint, very small, slightly elongated, diffuse.  Forms an isosceles triangle with a mag 12 star 3.4' W and a mag 13 star 4.5' NNW.  Located 4.0' NE of NGC 7834 in the NGC 3 group.  The NGC 7837/38 pair lies 5' SSE.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7835 = m 597 on 29 Nov 1864 and noted "eF, S, R."  His position is accurate.  The same night he found NGC's 7834, 7837, 7838, 3 and 4.

17.5" (11/14/87): fairly faint, small, round, small bright core.  A string of four mag 11-12 stars of 5' length follows.  Not identified as NGC 7831 in the UGC or CGCG.  Listed as Anon 1 in the Webb Society Deep Sky Observers Handbook on Anonymous Galaxies.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 7836 = Sw. II-2 on 20 Sep 1885 and recorded "eF; vS; R; between 2 stars."  There is nothing near his position but 75 seconds of RA east and 8' north is UGC 65.  Similar offsets in RA and Dec yield identities for NGC 19, NGC 21 and NGC 7831, all discovered the same night (NGC 6 also shares the same offset in RA).  Bigourdan measured a corrected position matching UGC 65 on 7 Sep 1888 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).


UGC 65 is not labeled as NGC 7836 in the UGC or CGCG.  RNGC and PGC have the correct identification. See Malcolm Thomson's "CGCG Corrections" and Corwin's notes for more on the story.

V = 14.4;  Size 0.5'x0.3';  Surf Br = 11.8;  PA = 171°


18" (10/21/06): extremely faint and small, round, attached at the west edge of NGC 7388 (just 0.6' between centers).  The pair is occasionally resolved with this galaxy appearing as a separate knot on the west edge of elongated NGC 7388.


17.5" (8/2/86): very faint, very small, round.  Forms a tight double system with NGC 7838 at the east edge 38" between centers.  Member of the NGC 3 group with NGC 7834 4.2' WNW and NGC 7835 4.7' NNW.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7837 = m 598, along with NGC 7838, on 29 Nov 1864 and simply noted "eF, D neb [with NGC 7838].

= *, Corwin.  Incorrect identification in the RNGC.


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 7839 = Big. 102, along with NGC 7833, on 18 Nov 1886.  He noted the size as 40"-50" with several points of condensation."  At his position (just 5' southwest of NGC 1) is a mag 15 star (with a mag 17 star at 21" separation), though Corwin notes the fainter star is likely too faint to have been seen in Bigourdan's 11-inch.  The RNGC new description appears to apply to NGC 2, though the coordinates seem to refer to NGC 7839.

NGC 7840 = PGC 1345780

00 07 08.8 +08 23 01; Psc

V = 15.5;  Size 0.4'x0.3';  PA = 127°


48" (10/24/11): at 610x appeared faint to fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated NW-SE, 24"x20", low even surface brightness.  Located 5.3' NNW of NGC 3 and 3.9' WNW of NGC 4.


18" (10/21/06): marginal galaxy in the NGC 3 group only glimpsed with averted and concentration, though it seemed to pop into view at the same location on a couple of occasions as a stellar or quasi-stellar knot.  Located 4' NE of NGC 7837/7838 and 5' NNW of NGC 3. Incorrectly classified as nonexistent in the RNGC.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 7840 = m 600 on 29 Nov 1864 and noted "eF, S."  The same night he discovered NGC's 7830, 7834, 7835, 7837, 7838, 3, 4.  With the exception of NGC 7830, which is mostly likely a star, the other members can be confidently identified with faint galaxies.  But there is no galaxy at his position for NGC 7840 and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.


However, Harold Corwin identifies PGC 1345780 as a likely candidate.  This extremely faint galaxy is ~3' south of Marth's position.  I missed it with my 17.5" and it was a marginal object in my 18", but Marth could have seen it using Lassell's 48" equatorial.  The identification was discussed with Corwin in personal correspondence on 18 Jul 1986.  The RNGC omission is listed in my RNGC Corrections #2.
