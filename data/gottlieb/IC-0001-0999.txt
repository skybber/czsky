Carl Frederick Pechüle discovered IC 4 on 12 Sep 1893 with an 11" refractor at the Copenhagen observatory, probably while searching for a comet.  He reported "very faint, pretty round, 10"-12" diameter, perhaps even bigger, fairly even brightness."  The IC position is 3' too far south, but there are no other nearby candidates.

MCG -01-01-074, located 8.2' SSW, appeared extremely faint, very small, occasionally elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, very low surface brightness.


Truman Safford discovered IC 6 = Sf. 89 = J. I-4 on 23 Sep 1867 with the 18.5-inch refractor at the Dearborn Observatory.  His position was 1' SE of PGC 1228, the brighter of a pair with IC 8, which he missed.  The Dearborn discovery list was not published until 1887 and added as an appendix to the NGC the following year.  Stephane Javelle probably was unaware of the prior discovery, and found the galaxy again on 19 Sep 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory. He reported it as the 4th object in his first discovery list with description, "faint, round, 15" diameter, stellar nucleus of 14th mag."  Dreyer assumed Sf. 89 referred to nearby IC 8 so Javelle was credited with the discovery of IC 6.

18" (9/6/10): this local group dwarf Irregular was immediately picked up at 108x (without a printed finder chart) as a large, low surface brightness hazy glow, ~4'x2.5', roughly elongated NW-SE, though the outer extent increased with averted vision and careful viewing.  A mag 12.7 star is superposed to the southeast of center and a few stars are on the northwest end.  The 1.5' region surrounding the mag 12.7 star is the brightest portion of the galaxy and the W and NW regions have a very low surface brightness and appeared irregular and patchy.  Located 12' NE of mag 7.3 HD 486 and just north of a right triangle of mag 10-11 stars


Using 175x, a very small 15" knot was clearly visible about 50" following the mag 12.7 star.  This knot is a giant HII region (site of violent starburst formation) catalogued by Hodge and Lee (1990) as HL 111.  At 285x with direct vision a faint star at its west edge was similar in visibility, but with averted vision the HII knot was more evident.  I probably viewed the brightest component 111c, which has a diameter of 11", of this HII complex.  Two mag 10.5 stars 3.5' S and 5.5' S of the galaxy (part of the right triangle mentioned above) provide a useful guide to pinpoint the location of HL 111.  The HII region is directly on a line and equally spaced with these stars -- just follow the stars to the small knot.


18" (7/15/07): at 225x this Local Group member (M31 subgroup) appeared faint, fairly large, slightly elongated NW-SE, ~4.5'x3.5', low even surface brightness except fades at the edges.  A mag 13 star is superimposed west of center and a fainter star follows.  Located 1.4 degrees ENE of mag 2.3 Beta Cas (Caph).


18" (10/8/05): picked up fairly easily at 115x as a large, low surface brightness hazy region with a mag 13 star superimposed.  Good view at 160x using the Meade 14mm Ultrawide.  Appeared faint, large, slightly elongated, ~4'-5' diameter (though no distinct borders) with a patchy, mottled appearance, very weak concentration.  Several faint stars (besides the mag 13 star) are superimposed.  Situated within a rich star field and appears similar to a low surface brightness emission or reflection nebula.


13.1" (11/5/83): very faint, moderately large, elongated NW-SE.  Unusually low even surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is superimposed near the center.  Located in a very rich star field just 3.3° from the galactic plane!  Member of the Local Group.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 10 = Sw. VII-1 on 8 Oct 1887 and recorded "F * involved in vL, eeeF nebulosity, eee difficult.  In line with 2 stars of equal mag which with a 3rd forms a right angled triangle."


Nicholas Mayall first recognized IC 10 as a galaxy in 1935 ("An Extragalactic Object 3° from the Plane of the Galaxy" in PASP, 47, 317).  In 1936, Hubble suggested it might be a member of the local group and called it "One of the most curious objects in the sky" in his 1936 classic "The Realm of the Nebulae."  This wasn't confirmed until 1996 using Cepheid variables and the current distance estimate is ~2.5 million l.y.  This irregular dwarf galaxy is probably a member of the M31 satellite system and it lies only 3.3 deg from the galactic plane.

E.E. Barnard found IC 11 around 1892 using the 6-inch Cooke refractor at Vanderbilt Observatory in Nashville.  The discovery was probably relayed directly to Dreyer as its not mentioned in any of his published papers.  There is nothing at the IC position but Corwin notes that his description points to NGC 281, which is 30 minutes of RA east, and perhaps there was a transcription error.

Stephane Javelle found IC 26 = J. 1-18, along with IC 27 and 28, on 4 Nov 1891.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by Francis Leavenworth on 2 Oct 1886 and reported in list I-5 (later NGC 135).  His rough position, though, is ~2 minutes too far west, but the identification is secure based on his sketch.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position for NGC 135 around 1899 (repeated in the IC 2 notes) though Dreyer failed to equate NGC 135 and IC 26.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 48 = IC 1577 on 30 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory while sweeping for comets.  He first reported in his notebook "Picked up a smallish pB neb." He worked out an accurate postion using the nearby offset star HD 3939 and called the nebula "pB, S, R, gbM to stellar nucleus 13m."  His position for 1888 (published in AN 3097) was very accurate, but Dreyer erroneously precessed the declination (to 1880 coordinates) 18' too far south.  Dreyer's IC description “pF, S (? var brightness)” is a brief summary of Barnard’s comments in AN 3097.


As far as IC 1577, Dreyer’s description reads “pB, S, R, gbM, stell N”.  This is identical to Barnard’s logbook description on 30 Nov 1888. Furthermore, the IC position (00h 37m 31s -08° 54.3’ in 1860 coordinates) is identical to Barnard’s logbook position of 00h 38m 56s  -08° 45’ (for 1888.0).  I assume Barnard sent this notebook data with a poor position to Dreyer after 1894.  Perhaps he scanned through his old notebooks looking for new nebulae and forgot about his earlier announcement. Whatever happened, it seems clear that IC 1577 = IC 48, both from his 30 Nov 1888 discovery.


Barnard believed IC 48 and IC 356 were variable nebulae ("Two Probably Variable Nebulae" in AN 3097, 1892) and wrote "On November 30, 1888 I discovered a small pretty bright nebula in Cetus [IC 48] and was surprised from the brightness of the nebula, to find that it was not in any catalogue.  I carefully measured its position with the micrometer, and examined it the next night, suspecting it to be a comet.  No motion being detected it was observed further.  I have a very distinct recollection of the object and from my description I would estimate that it was between 9th and 10th magnitude.  In its center was a very small stellar nucleus of the 13th mag.  Not having seen the nebula in my subsequent sweeps in that neighborhood, I was led in 1891 to examine its position with the 12-inch.  The nebula was found with some difficulty.  It was extremely faint, and was only identified by the aid of the comparison star of the previous observation.  This was November 22, 1891.  I estimated it to be 13.5 magnitude, 1/2' in diameter, with perhaps a faint nucleus."


The galaxy was photographed 6 times between 1915 and 1919 at the Helwan Observatory in Egypt and reported in 1921 as displaying no variability.

24" (9/30/16): at 282x; fairly faint, small, round, 18" diameter, gradually increases to a faint stellar nucleus.  Situated within a triangle formed by mag 9.1 HD 4306 10' WSW, mag 8.5 HD 4435 7.5' SE and mag 9.7 HD 4410 4' NE.  The latter star has two wide 13.5-14 companions.  In addtion a mag 11.2 star is 2' SE.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 50 = J. 1-32 on 27 Sep 1892.  He noted "faint, appears as a mag 13 star surrounded by nebulosity" and measured an accurate position.

24" (9/8/18): at 375x; faint to fairly faint, fairly small.  The galaxy initially appeared elongated 4:3 or 3:2 E-W, ~30"x20" and brighter along the major axis, but then I realized there was a faint star [mag 15.7] at the western end of the galaxy that enhanced the elongation.  IC 53 is located 21' W of STF 67, an excellent 9.0/9.6 pair at 2.3" that was easily resolved with plenty of black space between.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 53 = Sw. X-3 on 25 Sep 1890 and recorded "eeeF pS; R; B * in field south.  Others suspected."  His position is about 3' too far northwest, but there are no other nearby galaxies and the description fits (a mag 8.5 star is 11' S).

18" (12/22/11): best view was unfiltered at 108x.  Appears as a faint, large, irregular glow, roughly 8'x5'. Elongated E-W and extends to a group of a half-dozen stars at the NE end.  This group of stars is also possibly involved with the haze.  There is a slightly brighter patch on the south side.  Located 25' N of Gamma Cas.


18" (7/15/07): this large reflection nebula just 20' N of Gamma Cas (Navi) has a low even surface brightness and appears as a large oval-shaped hazy region ~6'x4' and elongated ~N-S.  Fainter of pair with IC 63 located 25' SE.


17.5" (11/1/86): located 20' N of Gamma Cassiopeia.  This emission nebula is larger than IC 63 but has a lower surface brightness.  Easy with averted vision and appears large, elongated ~N-S, with a fairly even surface brightness.  IC 63 lies 20' SE.


13.1": very faint, fairly large, very diffuse, visible with averted only.  Forms a pair with IC 63.


IC 59 and 63 were discovered independently on photographs taken by Max Wolf (probably towards the end of 1893) as well as E.E. Barnard on a plate taken 2 Feb 1894 of 3 hours exposure.  Wolf announced the discovery in AN 134 [3214], 365 (1894), "Ueber einige neue Nebelflecke" (Some New Nebulae).  Barnard stated "before beginning this [second] exposure [on 6 Feb 1894], I carefully examined the sky close to Gamma with the 12-inch and a power of 80, with a field of 42'.  The sky was fine.  It was with the utmost difficulty that I could see these two nebulae.  They were excessively dilute and faint, and never would have detected if the photographic plate (from 2 Feb) had not revealed them."  Roberts photographed the Gamma Cas area earlier on 17 Jan 1890, but his image shows no nebulosity and he failed to mention nebulosity in the field.

The southern edge, which extends towards the SW, is slightly brighter and more sharply defined.  The interior of the wedge is slightly fainter with subtle brightness variations.  The OIII and UHC filter dimmed the object.  IC 63 is brighter than IC 59, which is found 20' N of Gamma.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 92 = Big. 115 on 2 Nov 1885 with the 12" refractor at Paris.  His position is a fairly close match with CGCG 502-029 = PGC 4780.  This galaxy has been assumed identical to NGC 468 = h98, discovered by John Herschel on 22 Nov 1827.  Herschel's position was 4' south of the galaxy and as a result Dreyer added the comment in the IC "? different from h 98", indicating his uncertainty if IC 92 was the same object.


In March 2015, Harold Corwin checked JH's observing logs (in response to an inquiry from Courtney Seligman about the identity), and found that Herschel made an error in reducing the position of NGC 468 by 37 seconds (recording the wrong wire).  Once corrected, his position for h98 = NGC 468 is a close match with NGC 472 = UGC 870, a significantly brighter galaxy than IC 92.  So, IC 92 should be the single identity for this galaxy.

He found this galaxy again on 18 Dec 1895 and included it in list XI-18 (later IC 1671).  His position, though, was poor (30 seconds of time too large and 2.3' too far south), so Dreyer naturally assumed it was new.  But Swift's description ("p 7m * nf 47 sec") confirms IC 93 = IC 1671.

But Safford's position is also 4.6' SW of IC 1672, so his object could be to either object.  Malcolm Thomson and Courtney Seligman favor IC 96 = IC 1672 as Safford only found one object and IC 1672 is roughly a magnitude brighter.

The NGC position (supposedly an improved micrometric position from C.H.F.

24" (12/1/13): moderately to fairly bright, small, round, 20", high surface brightness.  Gradually increases towards the center, then a sharp stellar nucleus.  A mag 14.5 star is at the southwest edge.  Brightest in a small trio with IC 1698 1.6' SSW and UGC 978 2.8' WNW.  IC 1704 lies 26' ESE.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 107 = Sw. X-5 on 18 Sep 1890 and recorded "vF; vS; R; * close preceding."  His position is 19 seconds of RA west of UGC 986 = PGC 5271, the brightest of a trio, and this galaxy has a star "close preceding" matching his description.  Coincidentally, his poor position falls near UGC 978, the faintest in the trio, which is misidentified as IC 107 in the CGCG, UGC, MCG, RC 3 and NGC 2000, as well as secondary sources such as Megastar software.


Stephane Javelle independently found PGC 5271 again on 18 Jan 1896 (along with IC 1698, IC 1704 and IC 1706), assumed it was new, and Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 1700.  Most sources identify UGC 986 as IC 1700 due to its unambiguous position, though by historical precedence IC 107 should be the primary designation.

18" (12/8/07): faint, quasi-stellar knot to the southeast of a N-S pair of stars (this pair is also collinear with NGC 592 located 6' S of IC 131).  But, according to Harold Corwin this compact HII region was assumed to be a mag 13.5 star by Bigourdan and IC 131 refers to two very small star clouds close following (seen in the 10/25/97 observation below, but missed this time). The nearly stellar knot I observed is catalogued as BCLMP 290B.


17.5" (10/25/97): very faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  This HII region is located 10' WNW of the center of M33 near a wide pair [50"] of mag 11/12 stars.  A mag 14 star is nearby and at first I thought this star was IC 131 (on the DSS this 14th magnitude "star" is a compact HII region and was also described as a star by Bigourdan).  Collinear with IC 133 8' N and IC 132 11.5' N.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 135 = B. 126, along with numerous other HII regions and star clouds in M33, on 28 Oct 1889.  Harold Corwin notes that Bigourdan made an error with the "estimated offset from M33's nucleus of his comparison star".  It also appears that his offsets were applied with the wrong signs as the relative positions of these objects are reversed in RA as well as declination!  As a result, the IC positions for IC 135, 136, 139, and 140 are incorrect and out of RA order.  But if the relative differences in RA and NPD are reversed and applied to IC 135 at the position given here, then they land on the correct positions for IC 136, 139 and 140.

24" (12/28/13): B324, a highly luminous hypergiant and the brightest individual star in M33, appeared as a 15th magnitude star at the north edge of IC 142.  At 325x, it was not resolved from the general glow, but appeared as a sharp stellar point just within the glow on the north side.  IC 142 is nearly collinear with a mag 13.5 star 2.1' NW and a mag 11 star 2.9' NW.  Globular Cluster U49 lies 3.3' NW.


18" (12/10/07): fairly bright, small, contains a bright core and faint extensions SW-NE, ~25"x13".  Forms the south vertex of an equilateral triangle with two mag 11 stars 3' WNW and 3' N.


17.5" (10/25/97): fairly faint, very small, round.  Stands out nicely 6' N of the center of M33.  Either contains a stellar spot near the center or a faint star is superimposed.  This "stellar spot" is likely B324, the brightest individual star in M33 excluding Luminous Blue Variables.  B324 is an A-type supergiant with a V magnitude of 15.2. IC 142 is the first of three HII regions in the spiral arm containing IC 142, IC 143 and ending with NGC 604.


Bindon or George Stoney discovered NGC 595 on 2 Feb 1851 with Lord Rosse's 72" (or perhaps on the 13 Sep 1850 observation, "full of knots") and an offset measured from a star superimposed just north of the core of M33.  The nebula was labeled as "2" on the diagram in the 1861 publication.  No coordinates were ever measured at Birr Castle.


Guillaume Bigourdan independently discovered IC 139 = B. 131, along with numerous other HII regions and star clouds in M33, on 28 Oct 1889.  Bigourdan was credited with the discovery in the IC as Dreyer had no way of confirmng Stoney's #2 was the same object.

It is perhaps slightly fainter than nearby IC 143 (= A75), but with averted vision A71 has a better defined border.  IC 143 is primarily a star cloud (no HII emission), while A71 is an HII region.

Leavenworth's rough position for J. 1-70 (later IC 146) is 1.6 min of RA east of this galaxy, a typical error.  Because of the poor position, Bigourdan was unable to recover the galaxy and Javelle assume his observation was new.  Herbert Howe reobserved and measured an accurate position for NGC 648 around 1900 (repeated in the IC 2 notes), though neither Howe nor Dreyer noticed the equivalence NGC 648 = IC 146.

Just earlier I had suggested identifications for IC 153 and IC 157, found by Swift in September 1890, based on 4 minutes of time corrections.  So, Corwin looked for a similar correction for these two numbers.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 152 = Sw. X-8, along with IC 151, on 11 Aug 1890 and recorded "eF, S, R, vF * close, sf of 2 [with IC 151]."  There is no pair of galaxies in the area matching his relative separations.  CGCG identifies CGCG 437-016 = PGC 6368 as IC 152.  This is the closest galaxy (2.7' to the NW) to Swift's position, but may be too faint to be one of Swift's galaxies and furthermore, there is no "vF * close".


After I suggested to Harold Corwin the possible identities IC 153 = UGC 1260 and IC 157 = UGC 1274 (with ~4 minute errors in RA), also Swift discoveries, he found that a 5 minute error in the position of IC 152 would match with NGC 677.  The "vF * close" might refer to the 14th magnitude star less than 1' NW of center or even NGC 675.  This identification is not certain, but certainly reasonable particularly given the other matches.

24" (9/23/17): at 375x; fairly faint, fairly small, round, 30" diameter.  Weak concentration but appears to have a brighter bar through the center oriented SW-NE [later confirmed on the DSS].  A mag 10.8 star is 2.5' NW.  UGC 1274 (likely IC 157) lies 17' NE.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 153 = Sw. X-9, along with IC 157, on 25 Sep 1890 and reported "eF, pS, R, sp of 2 [with IC 157]."  There is nothing at his position and Corwin concludes this object is nonexistent.  The nearest galaxy he might have picked up is CGCG 437-018 = PGC 6381, located 12' S of his position, but there is nothing at his relative offset to IC 157 (~21' NE).


In 2017, I noticed that exactly 4 minutes of RA east of Swift's position is UGC 1260 (dec matches within 1') and 17' NE of this galaxy is UGC 1274.  Is this pair IC 153 and 157?  Swift's descriptions in this case are not very helpful, but regarding IC 157 he states: "D * and wide D p, nf of 2."  Do these comments apply to UGC 1274?  About 8' northwest of UGC 1274 is a 10th magnitude star (SAO 92644) that has a wide companion, and also 8' southwest is a closer and fainter double star.  So, I think these conditions are met and Corwin concurs this identification is likely.


Following my suggestion, Corwin found that IC 151 and IC 152, found by Swift on 11 Aug 1890, might have similar RA errors of 5 minutes, matching UGC 1271 and NGC 677.  The declinations match to within 1' and the RA differences match as well.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 157 = Sw. X-10, along with IC 153, on 25 Sep 1890.  There are no nearby galaxies he might have picked up and both Corwin and Thomson concluded these numbers were lost.  Looking at the general region, I noticed that if Swift made a 4 minute error in RA, it's possible that IC 153 = UGC 1260 and IC 157 = UGC 1274, though in the latter case the offset in RA is close to 3.5 minutes in RA.  Corwin agrees this is a reasonable hypothesis, and 5 minutes errors in RA also accounts for IC 151 = UGC 1271 and IC 152 = NGC 677, found by Swift a month earlier.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 161 = Sw. IX-3 on 3 Oct 1889 or 8 Jan 1891 and recorded, "eeF; S; cE, between 2 dist star in meridian."  He returned to the field in January 1891 and recorded IC 161 again, as well as IC 162 (list X-11 and X-12).   It's not certain whether his first observation in 1889 refers to the southwest or northeast member of this pair.  To further confuse the situation, the entry for List X-11 is 10' too far south and Dreyer used the erroneous dec for IC 161.


UGC, CGCG and MCG all misidentify IC 161 = UGC 1266 as IC 162 and don't assign an IC designation to IC 162 = UGC 1267.  See Corwin's notes on IC 161 and 162 as well as Malcolm's Thomson's IC Corrections.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 162 = Sw. X-11 in January 1891 or perhaps earlier on 3 Oct 1889 (list IX-3).  The interpretation depends on which single galaxy he picked up in 1889.  Furthermore, Swift's position for List  XI-11 is 10' too far south.  The UGC, CGCG and MCG misidentify IC 161 (southwestern member of the pair) as IC 162.

17.5" (8/5/97): position identified at 100x using a GSC chart, although only a couple of stars are plotted.  Appears as a very faint circular glow with a couple of faint stars superimposed.  Located 7' E of a wide pair of mag 9/11 stars [at 38" separation].  Does not resemble a cluster in appearance and would have otherwise thought this was a Milky Way patch. At 220x, the glow is ~4' in diameter and there are a sprinkling of ~10 very faint stars, mostly mag 14.5-15.5 with one mag 13 star.  The glow has an irregular surface brightness with a mottled appearance and the periphery is not well defined.


William Denning discovered IC 166 around 1890 with his 10-inch With-Browning reflector.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer.  The IC position corresponds with the faint open cluster Tombaugh 3 = OCL-334 = Lund 60.


Clyde Tombaugh independently found IC 166 in Jan/Feb of 1941 while surveying the circumpolar region from Lowell Observatory with the 13-inch Lowell telescope.  He tentatively identified "Tombaugh 3" as an open cluster, though thought is might be a loose globular or "even a midget galaxy just beyond the border of our Milky Way System".

24" (12/22/14): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 24"x12", nearly even surface brightness.  Located 5' NE of the double system IC 187.


18" (12/22/11): faint to fairly faint, small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, 20"x15", weak concentration to center but no nucleus.  Located 5' NE of IC 187.  The IC designation (from Corwin) is uncertain due to a poor declination by Swift.


Edward Swift discovered IC 188 = Sw. IX-8, along with IC 187, on 18 Jan 1890, while searching for "Swift's Comet".  Described as "eeef, vS; R; 2 stars point to it."  There is nothing at his position, but 10 sec of RA west and 30' south is UGC 1510, and there is a pair of 12th magnitude stars to the north-northwest that could fit Swift's description.


But due to the large error in declination Malcolm Thomson rejects UGC 1510 as IC 188.  He argues that no similar error occurred with nearby IC 187, and if he did find this galaxy, the description would have mentioned "sp of 2" and "nf of 2." for the pair.   No modern catalogue identifies UGC 1510 as IC 188.  So this identification is quite uncertain.  See Harold Corwin's IC identification notes as well as Courtney Seligman's summary.

Lewis Swift found IC 191 = Sw. IX-9 on 20 Oct 1889 and reported "pB; pL; lE."  His position is at the west edge of NGC 794.  Dreyer perhaps assumed it was new due to Swift's description, which differed significantly from WH's "eF, vS, stellar,240 showed it very plainly." Dreyer added the parenthetical comment "probably = [NGC 794]" in the IC description and certainly NGC 794 = IC 191.

A fairly thin long arm or tail extends due south from the core and then curls southwest towards IC 195.  It appears to spread out and dim on the southwest end [0.9' from center].   A shorter arm extends north from the core ~30" and dims abruptly.  But a very low surface brightness, elongated N-S patch is detached on the northern end (part of an outer tidal tail or loop) ~1' from the center.  A companion (LEDA 212903) is just northeast of this patch, 1.3' NNE of center.  It appeared faint, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 15"x9".

He recorded the same galaxy a second time on 29 Jan 1897 as J. 3-192 with the desciption "faint, round, 30", gradually brighter middle, similar to a 14th mag star."  He actually made a comment that it was found while measuring IC 198, though apparently he didn't realize he had already placed it in his second discovery list along with IC 198.

Stephane Javelle found IC 228 = J. 1-85 on 7 Dec 1891.  His position corresponds with PGC 9300.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by Leavenworth on 1 Jan 1886, but his rough position for LM 1-55 (later NGC 944) was 1.5 minutes too far east so Javelle thought it was a new object.  Corwin verified that Leavenworth's discovery sketch matches PGC 9300.  So, IC 228 = NGC 944.

Situated between mag 8.6 SAO 55698 just off the south end 2.2' from center and a mag 9.6 star 3.3' N within a distinctive asterism of 5 brighter stars.  Located ~45 due west of NGC 1023.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 239 in 1893 and it was announced in MNRAS 54, 371 (1894), "Photograph of a 'New' Spiral Nebula in Perseus."  He noted "the convolutions of the spiral is very faint, but clearly visible on the negative, and involved in them are four 14-15 mag stars and 6 or 7 stars, or star-like condensations, less bright than 16th mag.  The convolutions are symmetrical, and proceed from a very faint star-like nucleus."

The galaxy described here is 1' due south of this offset.

William Herschel discovered IC 257 = Sw.

He didn't assign this nebula an internal discovery number or H-designation due to his uncertainty so it was never published, but his position is just 2' north of IC 257 and the orientation of the galaxy (PA 155°) is a reasonable match with his description.  Steinicke confirms this observation (email April 2015).

Sherburne Wesley Burnham discovered IC 259, along with IC 258, on 3 Sep 1891 while observing double stars with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He measured the offsets for both objects correctly with respect to 10th magnitude BD +40°608.  But he applied his RA (time) offset in the wrong direction for the western object, which he described as double.  So the computed position for IC 258 is east of IC 259, placing these objects out of RA order in the sky.  As a result, the identifications of IC 258 and IC 259 are reversed in UGC, CGCG, PGC, HyperLeda, WikiSky, etc.  NED has the correct identifications.

IC 275 is a triple system with the two closer components (IC 275 NED1 and NED2) separated by 15" N-S.

Also, this galaxy is at least a magnitude fainter than IC 301, though both were described as "eF".  So, Corwin mentions its possible the position is well off and this is not the intended object.


I noticed that if Swift recorded or transcribed his RA by 1 minute too large, then his position would correspond with UGC 2590.  And there is a bright star to the southwest as required, though HD 19736 (11' SW) is 6th magnitude, so a couple of magnitudes brighter than Swift suggested.

24" (2/7/16): IC 316 is a spectacular interacting/merging pair of spiral galaxies with the nuclei of the two galaxies separated by only 11".  The close duo is embedded in a irregular common halo about 1' across.  At 226x, a single fairly faint glow was seen, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~25" diameter.  At 452x (10mm ZAO + 2x Powermate), I immediately noticed a nearly stellar nucleus [of the northern face-on spiral] offset near the north edge creating an unusual appearance.  Often a very faint "spike" [the southern edge-on spiral] was seen close south of the stellar nucleus, angling towards the southeast, ~15"x5".

24" (3/21/20): at 124x and 200x; this obscured galaxy contained a very bright 30" nucleus that gradually increased to a sharp stellar point.  The nucleus was surrounded by a fairly faint core/central region with a diameter of at least 1'.  A 12th mag star is just 1' N of the nucleus.  This star is the middle of 3 nearly in a line with a mag 12 star 2' E and a mag 11 star 2.5' WSW.  A very diffuse halo of low but irregular surface brightness extends ~15', best viewed at 124x.  A distinctive string of 6 stars oriented NW-SE cuts across the halo to the southwest of the nucleus.  Spiral arm structure was very subtle and only seen in patches or sections, one on the north side, roughly 5' from the core.


UGC 2826, located 21' NW, appeared fairly faint, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~0.6'x0.4', low but uneven surface brightness, weak concentration.


17.5" (12/16/95): very unusual galaxy, appears as a very faint, very large glow surrounding a 1' high surface brightness core that increases to a bright stellar nucleus.  The irregular halo is difficult to trace but extends to ~10' diameter with a number of superimposed stars including a striking 6' string of six mag 10.5-12.5 stars oriented NW-SE on the southwest side of the halo.  No arm structure was seen.  The core forms a small triangle with two similar superimposed mag 11 stars 1.0' N and 2.0' NE.  Situated just 10.6° above the galactic plane and suffers from significant dust obscuration.


13.1" (1/18/85): at 144x the nucleus is prominent as a mag 12 "fuzzy" star.  At this power the outer halo disappears.


8" (3/21/20):  the small core/nucleus was very noticeable, as well as a very large, roundish outer halo ~15' diameter with a diaphanous appearance.  The halo seemed to fill in the gaps between the numerous surrounding stars.


8" (10/13/81): very faint, large, very diffuse outer halo, very small prominent 12th magnitude nucleus.  A line of three stars is superimposed.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 342 on 11 Aug 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He sketched it at 150x as well as 500x and noted, "with 500x it is quite a bright object, 1/2' dia and quite [?], mbM, not cometary.  Object 1' S of this star [shown on sketch] and following 3 or 4 seconds." His rough position and sketch (showing the superimposed linear strings of stars) is an excellent match.


William Denning independently discovered IC 342 on 19 Aug 1892 while comet hunting with his 10-inch reflector.  The discovery was announced in a short note, "New nebula", Astronomy and Astro-Physics, 12, 189 (1893).  He called it "rather faint, with nucleus about 12th magnitude, and very small, but it was sufficiently conspicuous to be discovered with a power of 40 only on my 10-inch reflector."  As Barnard never published his discovery or informed Dreyer, Denning was credited with the discovery in the IC.


In a note by Hubble and Seyfert titled "A Spiral Nebula of Unusually Large Dimensions" (Harvard College Observatory Bulletin No. 899, pp.16-17): "In a letter written to Dr. J. L. Dreyer before 1894, Mr. W. F. Denning, the well known meteor observer of Bristol, included in a short list of new nebulae an object in the position 3h 37m 8s, +67d 46.9' (1900), which was simply described as "pretty bright, very small, star of 12th magnitude close to nucleus."


Hubble and Humason (1934), first recognized this object as a spiral galaxy and suggested it was possibly a Local Group member (heavily reddened) based on its recessional velocity, though it was later shown to be too distant.  IC 342 is one of the brightest members of the IC 342/Maffei Group that includes NGC 1560, NGC 1569 and highly obscured Maffei I and 2.

As a result both the GC (756) and NGC (1397) misidentify h305 as H III-569.  h305 (later IC 344) did not receive a separate NGC designation and it's his only discovery with an IC designation.  This galaxy was also observed at Birr Castle, though also missed on several occasions.


Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy on 23 Dec 1889 and reported Sw. IX-13 as "eeF; pL; R; passed in line with 1417-18; cometary; unable to refind it; seeing good.  Failed also at Harvard College Observatory [during a visit]."  Swift published a note in AN 126, 225 that "in description of nebula no. 13 for "passed" read "1st of 3".  Calling attention to apparently so trivial a matter may seen unimportant, but it has more significance than at first sight appears, as I strongly suspect it to have been a comet, as at two subsequent examinations it could not be found.  It was in in line with NGC 1417 and 1418 and all three were seen simultaneously."  Swift gave an even more detailed review of this object in Astronomy and Astro-Physics (formerly Popular Astronomy, 11 (1892), so he clearly put a lot of effort and time on it.  Frank Muller also found IC 344 in late 1887 while measuring positions for NGC 1417 and 1418.  Dreyer credited both JH (h305) and Swift in the IC.  Sherburne Burnham measured IC 344 (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) and correctly sorted out the confusion with JH's observation.

Frank Muller discovered IC 346 = #171 on 21 Oct 1887 at the Leander McCormick Observatory and noted, "E 80° (WSW-ENE), 1.0'x0.8', mag 15.5, diff."  His position matches ESO 548-078.  But the IC position is based on an observation by Ormond Stone and there is nothing at his position.  Swift found the ESO galaxy again and reported it as new in his 11th discovery list.


Herbert Howe suggested Muller's object was identical to Sw. XI-60 and Dreyer made the following note in the IC 2: "The place and description should be 03 35 26, 108° 43.0', eF, pL, E 80°, dif (my mistake).  Is no doubt identical with Sw. XI 60; 03 35 13, 108° 39.8'."  Dreyer gave no explanation of how the mistake was made, but perhaps he had meant to use Muller's observation instead or he noticed that Swift's observation closely matched Muller's.  In any case, Dreyer's corrected position matches object #171 in the Leander-McCormick Southern Nebulae catalogue.   Harold Corwin suggests that Stone's erroneous position may be due to a misidentified offset star.

17.5" (12/16/95): IC 348 is an unusual object consisting of a scattered group of stars with associated nebulosity (vdB 19) situated near a large dark cloud virtually devoid of stars.  The cluster consists of 15 stars of varying magnitudes in a 6' group and is located 5'-10' S of Omicron = 38 Persei (V = 3.8).  The brightest star in the group is mag 8.4 SAO 56680, which has two nearby companions and the group is clearly encased in a fairly bright reflection nebula, ~3' diameter.  The star at the southwest end of the cluster is a nice close evenly matched double (∑437 = 9.8/10 at 11").  The immediate 50' low power field to the south is strangely devoid of almost all stars! (Barnard 3 and 4).  Omicron also has a halo but this appears to be scattered light.


Truman Safford discovered IC 348 = Sf 70 on 1 Dec 1866 and recorded "vL, pB, vgbM."  He added the footnote "a loose cluster with nebula" and his position is accurate.  E.E. Barnard independently discovered the nebulosity near Omicron Persei (though not a cluster) on a plate taken 6 Dec 1893 at Lick Observatory and Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 1985.


The Lynga position for the scattered cluster is about 8' too far north and this error is repeated in the Sky Catalogue 2000.

Size 0.5'


48" (10/31/13):  IC 349 is a reflection knot just 36" SSE of Merope.  We used 813x and carefully placed Merope barely outside the north edge of the field.  The orientation was easy to judge using two 15th magnitude stars 1.8' S and 1.8' SSW of Merope and the elongated glow fell between the diffraction spikes.  Despite the glare from Merope making the observation much more difficult, I was surprised this small reflection nebula was fairly bright and elongated (roughly pointing south from Merope) with a straighter western edge, perhaps 20"x10" in size.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 349, a fan-shaped knot of nebulosity just 0.6' SSE of Merope, visually on 14 Nov 1890 using the Lick 36" refractor.  It was announced in a discovery note in AN 3018.  "On Nov. 14 while examining the cluster, I discovered a new and comparatively bright round cometary nebula close south and following Merope, every precaution was taken to prove that it was not a ghost of Merope by examining the other stars of the group under the same conditions.  I have since seen it several times and on Dec. 8th I could see it with some difficulty in the 12-inch by occulting Merope with a wire in the eyepiece.  With the great telescope the nebula can be seen fairly well with Merope in the field and is conspicuous when the star is placed just outside the north edge of the field.  It is about 30" in diameter, of the 13th mag, gradually brighter in the middle, and very cometary in appearance.  It was examined with powers of 300, 520 and 1500, with all of which it was comparatively easy."

At 220x, this high surface brightness PN was clearly nonstellar and slightly oval with a hint of a sparkle (central star) at the center.  At 500x, appeared as a small, well-defined disc, elongated 4:3 SW-NE with dimensions ~7"x5".  The quasi-stellar center was brighter with a small, fainter halo that seemed irregular.  A couple of faint stars are close west and north.  Located 3.5' NW of a distinctive trio of mag 10/11/13 stars.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 351 on 5 Dec 1890 with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory, while examining the region near Comet Zona.  He estimated a diameter of 4.6" and a magnitude of 10.5-11.  Sherburne Burnham measured a diameter of 10".


Based on a Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) described, "central star can be made out and is perhaps as bright as mag 14.  The nebula shows a minute elliptical disk, which is 8"x6" in PA 10° in a 5 minute exposure.  An elongated brighter patch is in the center."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 356 on 23 Aug 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  His simple eyepiece sketch clearly identifies the neighboring stars.  Barnard didn't publish his discovery until 1892 (AN 3097) in response to an independent discovery by William Denning on 7 Nov 1890 (Observatory, 15, 104 (1892)).  Barnard's article was titled "Two Probably Variable Nebulae".  In the article he mentions "from its brightness it is not possible that it has been so conspicuous for any great length of time, or it would surely have been found by Swift and others."


Both Barnard and Denning are credited in the IC.  Denning was a bit peeved about Barnard's late discovery note and wrote "Mr. Barnard claims to have discovered [IC 356] in August 1889 whereas I did not pick it up until Nov 1890.  While admitting this claim, I would venture to remark that anyone who makes a discovery ought to be prompt in announcing it, as a delay of several years is very likely to cause misconception and unnecessary trouble to others.  I think that in ordinary cases priority of announcement ought to be accepted as priority of discovery."  He also questioned Barnard's claim that the nebula had recent brightened, stating "I have picked up this object many times during the last two years  without noticing any change in it other than can be fully accounted for by differences  in atmospheric conditions."


But perhaps Barnard wasn't the first to discover this galaxy.  Swift claimed (Astro-Physics, Vol XI, 566) an earlier discovery before 1879 based on marking the object on his Burritt's star atlas, though he didn't record or remember any particulars, stating he thought his early discoveries were all known!

Lewis Swift discovered IC 359 = Sw. II-29 = Sw. X-14 on 20 Aug 1885 and reported "vF; pL; R; lbM."  His position is just 2.7' W (12 seconds of RA) of IC 359.  He added a long note: "Resembles a Comet.  Moonlight and clouds prevented verification until Sept. 6, when it could not be found.  Am certain of its place, and of its configuration with 4 stars.  Have examined the place three times and am certain of its absence.  Seeing on one occasion as good as when discovered."  He also stated in the introduction, "No. 19 [from list I] must therefore be struck out, and with great probability No. 29 of this Catalogue also."  As a result, Dreyer didn't assigned Sw. II-29 an NGC designation.


Swift rediscovered this galaxy on 25 Dec 1891 and recorded "eeF; pL; R; Not no. 29 cat. 2.  That is still missing."  There is nothing at his position but UGC 2980 lies 1 minute of time west and despite his comment, Sw. II-29 almost certainly applies to the same object.  This galaxy is not identified as IC 359 in MCG (+05-10-009) and IC 359 is misidentified as the reflection nebula GN 04.15.5 = DG 29 = LBN 782 at 04 19.0 +28 17 (2000) in NGC 2000, Lynds, MOL, Neckel and Vehrenberg, etc (private communication with Corwin on 10/3/94).

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 361 on 10 Oct 1890 with the 6 1/2" refractor at Lick Observatory.  He recorded in his logbook, "In 6 1/2 inch it is apparently a very faint nebula between two or three stars.  In 12-inch (175x) it is pL, excessively faint and seems to be an excessively faint cluster or extremely faint stars, with possibly some nebulosity - power too high."  His simple sketch shows the cluster on line with two 6th magnitude stars to the southwest and the identity is certain. Barnard never published his discovery or notified Dreyer.


William Denning found it again on 11 Feb 1893 with his 10-inch reflector (see The Observatory, 41, 140).  On 14 Sep he logged, "Cluster large and faint.  It is really a nebula with minute stars strewn about it. With power 252 the nebulous matter vanishes, but power 40 shows it very conspicuously."  Denning was credited with the discovery in the IC.

William Denning discovered IC 381 on 26 Aug 1889 while comet-seeking at 32x with his 10-inch reflector in England.  At first he thought it might be identical to NGC 1530, but suspected it was new due to the discrepancy in position. The following year he accidentally ran across NGC 1530 and was certain his find was new.  He commented "with a power of 145 it is pretty faint, rather small, and there is a star of the 12th mag. on its N.W. border.  Two or three other extremely minute stars closely outlie the object, but they are near the limits of my aperture."  IC 381 was called "NGC 1530A" by Philip Keenan's in a table of new nebulae found on Yerkes plates and published in 1935 and deVaucouleurs used this designation in his 1964 Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 396 on 20 Sep 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted a "small, indef, 12 1/2 mag, field marked by 3 or 4 pairs of stars.  The neb = 3/4' diameter, somewhat brighter in the middle [difficult to read]." His rough position is off by 16', but he made an accurate field sketch that clearly identifies this galaxy.  He later computed an accurate position using the coordinates for his offset star (HD 30530). William Denning independently discovered it just a month later (19 Oct 1890), describing "F, S, R< bMN, F double star Sf."  Denning was credited with the discovery in the IC as Barnard never notified Dreyer.

The H-beta filter somewhat increases the contrast of the nebulosity.  The haze is brightest in the region surrounding AE and extends mostly in a broad fan for 10'-15' to the north and northeast.

John Martin Schäeberle discovered IC 405 photographically on 21 Mar 1892 using the Willard lens strapped to the 6-inch Clark refractor at Lick Observatory.  An announcement ("A Large New Nebula in Auriga") and description was given in PASP, Vol 4, No. 22.  Max Wolf also photographed it on 25 Sep 1892 (AN 131 [3130], 159) and in 1903 reported this nebula "looks like a burning body from which several enormous curved flames seem to break out like gigantic prominences".  He urged his colleagues to aim their spectroscopes at this "flaming star" - hence the name "Flaming Star Nebula".

The orientation and offset to the brighter star (HD 34528) are a perfect match with this galaxy.  But Dreyer assumed the observation refered to NGC 1832 (GC 1043), located 1.4° WSW, so he didn't assign a new NGC number.

See observing notes for IC 2121.  Identification uncertain.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 408 = Sw. VIII-38 on 2 Feb 1889, along with IC 411, while using the 12-inch Lick refractor during a visit to Barnard in California.  His description reads "vF; pS; E; 5' n of 8 1/2 mag star."  In a note added to his 8th list, Swift wrote, "During an almost momentary use of the 12 inch at Lick Observatory, I detected four nebulae in one field.  In response to my query if he could see them, Prof. Barnard replied that he could see six.  He gave me the places of two of mine nos. 38-9 [IC 408 and IC 411].  Arriving home too late and the weather being unfavorable, I was unable to get positions of the other two as I expected.  From their low altitude and the interference of the eletric street lights, it is doubtful if I shall ever be able to see them from here, and therefore I shall be obliged to depend on the kindness of Prof. Barnard for their places, when they shall again come into favorable position."  Barnard includes the positions and descriptions in his logbook, but there is no additional information.


There is nothing at Barnard's position for IC 411 (in list VIII and copied correctly into the IC).  Corwin suggests the observation may refer to a double star at 05 18 04.2  -25 10 16.  Its position is off by over 5', but there is a mag 7.5 mag star 5.5' SE.  I think a more likely possibility is IC 408 refers to IC 2121 (later discovered by Swift on 26 Dec 1897), which is nearly 2 minutes of RA further east and has a mag 7.0 star 4.8' SW.

Size 40'x30'


24" (1/4/14): at 125x unfiltered; emission nebulosity was evident surrounding and beyond the borders of open cluster NGC 1893, but only a large patch to the northwest of the cluster stood out well.  A UHC filter transformed the nebula to a showpiece and it appeared bright, very large (~30' diameter), very irregular with a large darker patch to the west of the central portion of the cluster.  The brightest section of nebulosity was to the NW of the cluster (as noticed without a filter), though mag 9.0 HD 242908 (a hot 04-type star) at the NW tip of the cluster is at the east edge of this bright, 6' circular patch.  Somewhat fainter nebulosity enveloped the entire cluster but an extensive field of nebulosity continued south of the cluster for an additional 10'.  It was difficult to see a clean edge on the south and west side as the nebulosity seemed to gradually fade away, but the entire diameter was at least 25'.


The cometary "Tadpoles" nebulae Simeis 130 and 129, which contain recently minted stars, lie on the east end of the cluster.  The "head" of Simeis 130 was immediately picked up at 200x as a very small, fairly high surface brightness knot with at least one star involved.  At 260x and 375, two very close "stars" oriented WSW-ENE were embedded in the glow, with the ENE object quasi-stellar (would not focus to a sharp point) and perhaps a very tight pair. Although impressive on images, there was no sign of the wavy tail extending from the "head" towards the NE.  Mag 9.1 BD+33 1028, 3' E of Simeis 130, along with a 6' group of a half-dozen mag 10-11 stars, were visually detached to the NE of the main cluster.


13.1" (1/18/85): very faint nebulosity involved with open cluster NGC 1893.  The brightest portion is at the NW edge of cluster.  A dark "hole" is just south of this nebulosity.  More extensive nebulosity is suspected but difficult to confirm due to the general background haze of the cluster.  Enhanced with UHC and OIII filters.


13.1" (2/25/84): nebulosity is evident preceding the NW star of the triangle of stars surrounding the cluster.  Very faint but definite with a filter in poor transparency.


Max Wolf discovered IC 410 on 25 Sep 1892 on a Heidelberg plate.  In AN 3130, p159, he noted the plate revealed a group of stars and a large nebula surrounding the star BD +33°1023.  His position matches the brightest star (mag 9.0 HD 242908) in the nebula.  NGC 1893 refers only to the open cluster, which was discovered by John Herschel.

48" (10/27/19): IC 412 and 412 form an interacting pair (VV 225) with the centers separated by 35" WNW-ESE.  A mag 12.3 star only 30" NE forms a small triangle with the two galaxies.  At low power (375x), IC 412 appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 25"x16", with a bright elongated core or bar.  We didn't try higher power to resolve the spiral arm extending north.


24" (1/12/13): both members of this interacting pair (VV 225) are fairly faint, small, roughly 20"-25" in size, and each contains small bright cores.  IC 412, the northwest component, is larger and more elongated , roughly 5:3 SW-NE, 25"x15".  IC 413 is just off the ESE side, 35" between centers. A mag 12.3 star is 30" ENE (at the north edge of IC 413).  The stretched spiral arm or tidal tail to the north was not seen. The pair is 14' WSW of the bright double 23 Ori = STF 696 (5.0/7.2 at 32").  IC 414 lies 8.5' S.


Member of a group (WBL 114 = LGG 130) at a distance of ~180 million l.y. with UGC 3294, 34' WNW.  This spiral appeared moderately bright and large, contains a very diffuse, low surface brightness halo perhaps 1.3'x0.6' NW-SE with a small brighter core that increases to a stellar nucleus.  The outer halo changes appearance with averted vision (no sharp edge) based on what part catches my averted vision.  Situated 4' W of mag 6.5 HD 34959 and the glare affects the view -- best with star placed outside the field.

Both galaxies are faint, very small, slightly elongated, ~25"x15", with small brighter cores.  IC 412 is elongated SSW-NNE and 30" SW of the mag 12 star - with the NE end just west of the star.  Located 6' SSW of mag 7.6 SAO 112679 and 14' WSW of the (32") mag 5/7 double 23 Orionis.  A third galaxy, IC 414, is in the field 8.5' S, forming the poor galaxy cluster WBL 114.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 412, along with IC 413, on 30 Oct 1888 while sweeping with the 12-inch telescope of Lick Observatory.  He noted "the nebulae are very small, roundish, mbM.  Close south of a small star."  His field sketch confirms the identification.  Sherburne Burnham, who discovered nearby IC 414, also observed and measured the pair at Lick Observatory (Publ of Lick Observatory, II). Stephane Javelle independently found the pair on 12 Jan 1894 and Barnard and Javelle are both credited with the discovery in the IC 1.


But Barnard must have later sent his original discovery to Dreyer, who assigned it as IC 2123 using Barnard's notebook description from 1888.  There are similar cases where Barnard sent a discovery to Dreyer after it already had been assigned an IC desingation.  Dreyer apparently missed the nearly identical positions.

I was surprised to see the planetary was clearly annular with a very bright, irregular rim that varied slightly in thickness and a fairly high contrast darker hole surrounding the central star.  The ring's outer rim was a shocking, deep raspberry color.  The color was more intense at 375x and slightly more saturated along one-half of the annulus.

There appears to be a very faint, thin envelope surrounding the main 10" disc extending a few arc seconds.  At 285x, the planetary is slightly oval NNW-SSE with subtle variations in surface brightness; slightly weaker around the central star and slightly brighter along portions of the rim.


18" (1/15/07): at 115x, the bright mag 10.5 central star is surrounded by a small 10" disc with a noticeable raspberry tint.


17.5" (2/22/03): at 100x, the bright 10.5 magnitude central star was centered in a 10" round halo with a definite rosy or raspberry tint at the outer edge of the halo, though the effect is fairly subtle.  Using an H-beta filter, the central star is strongly dimmed but the halo is significantly enhanced, dramatically changing the view of this planetary.  At 380x, no color was visible but the halo was a bit asymmetrical with a "softer" edge and possible double shell structure.  The center was very slightly darker around the central star.


17.5" (12/30/99): at 82x the mag 10.5 central star was enveloped in a very small round halo which appeared to have a slight reddish tinge at its edge.  This is a low-excitation PN and using a H-beta filter, the halo brightened and the central star faded, leaving a more noticeable disc.  At 220x, the prominent central star was surrounded by a well-defined 10" halo that partially "blinked" on and off switching from averted to direct vision.  At 280x, the small halo was possibly surrounded by an extremely faint envelope, but this could not be confirmed.  380x and 500x presented a superb view of the inner disc which appeared weakly annular.


17.5" (3/8/97): unusually bright mag 10.5 central star surrounded by a small high surface brightness halo.  At 220x, this planetary has a distinct "blinking" effect; staring at central star partially washes out the halo and with averted the halo is more dominant.  At 82x, an unusual rosy tinge is evident at the edge of the small halo, although the effect is fairly subdued.  The seeing was not steady enough for high power viewing of the outer shell.


17.5": high surface brightness planetary, appears very bright at 481x.  Contains a bright "fuzzy" central star with a bright inner portion surrounded by a second fainter shell slightly elongated N-S.


13.1" (10/20/84): very bright, small, takes 350-410x well, bright central star, subtle shell structure.


8" (2/5/81): nearly stellar at 100x, bright, appears as a mag 10 star with a small, faint bluish halo.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 418 on 26 Mar 1891 based on a spectrum plate taken at Harvard College Observatory.  In a letter communicated by Pickering in AN 3049, she mentioned the hydrogen spectrum [H-beta] was unusually large for a planetary.  Pickering was attributed with the discovery in the NGC.  W.W. Campbell, who credited Fleming with the discovery, made the first visual observation.  In 1891 he reported "it is a beautiful object as seen in the 36-inch telescope [Lick], consisting of a 9th magnitude star surrounded by a circular disc of blue light nearly 15" in diameter."


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported, "central star of mag 19, surrounded by a bright somewhat elliptical ring 14"x11" in outside diameter, and about 12"x10" along its central line; pa 163°."  Walter Scott Houston may have made the first visual observation in 1945 using a 10" reflector.


A star is plotted at this position on the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas because the BD catalogue included the central star.

IC 434 = LBN 953 = Sh 2-277 = Ced 55n

05 41 00 -02 24; Ori

Size 60'x10'


24" (2/13/18): I was surprised to easily pick up the IC 434 strip extending south of Zeta Orionis unfiltered at 124x (21mm Nagler). Although the Horsehead wasn't prominently visible, I could also see the notch unfiltered!


13.1" (1/11/86): using an H-beta filter IC 434 appears a very faint, very large, very elongated strip of nebulosity running south of Zeta Orionis for almost one degree in a N-S direction.  There is a well-defined sharp edge along the east side while the west side fades off into the background.  Contains the famous dark nebula B33 = "Horsehead Nebula" as a dark "notch".  IC 434 extends beyond NGC 2023 off the east edge and the star density drops off significantly east of IC 434 whereas a number of faint stars are pepper the field to the west of IC 434.  This is one of the few emission nebulae that responds very well to a H-Beta filter.  Extremely difficult without filter.


24" (1/21/12): the view of the Horsehead through a 24" f/4.1 Starmaster using a Collins I3 image intensifier mated with a narrowband H-alpha filter at the Mauna Kea visitor center (9300') was absolutely stunning.  The outline stood out in extremely sharp relief like a photograph and the dark cloud was pitch black against the bright background.  I'm not sure of the magnification used but the field was 30' or less and the Horsehead was large enough to show exquisite detail in the outline.


17.5" (12/26/00 and 12/28/00): at 100x using an H-beta filter, the huge IC 434 strip was very prominent and easy to follow south from Zeta Orionis throughout the entire 50' field of view.  The boundary was razor-sharp along its eastern edge against a background sky darkened by the H-beta filter.  The Horsehead was very easy to view as a nearly black, semi-circular 4' indentation that protruded into the nebulosity.  With averted vision there was a short extension or knob on the north side.  This forms the snout of the horse and with concentration faint nebulosity is visible just below (east) of the snout.


17.5" (10/8/88): easily held with direct vision using the H-beta filter.  The head or snout protrudes to the north.


17.5" (9/14/85 and 10/12/85): the Horsehead Nebula appears as a jet black dark nebula using an H-beta filter at 84x superimposed against the fairly prominent emission nebula IC 434.  Appears as a semi-circular indentation or "bite" of 5' diameter along the sharply defined eastern edge of IC 434 "strip" which extends through field in a N-S orientation.  Significant contrast gain with and H-Beta filter which renders the background sky and B33 extremely dark.  Difficult to see the "snout" feature which protrudes to the north but it is detectable.  Mag 8.5 SAO 132451 lies 8' N.


13.1" (1/18/85): visible with direct vision with H-Beta filter and striking with averted.  The snout was suspected.  The contrast between B33 and the sky was high with the background jet black and sharply outlined against the easy glow of IC 434.  Best view with 24mm.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 434 on Harvard College Observatory plates in 1883. Edward Pickering announced the discovery (along with a number of other Orion nebulae) in the 1890 Harvard Annals publication (1890AnHar..18..113P).  She also described the dark notch (later dubbed the "Horsehead") as "A large nebulosity extending nearly south the Zeta Orionis for about 60'.  More intense and well marked on the following side with a semicircular indentation 5' in diameter 30' south of Zeta. All good plates of this region show this object, and it has been used here as a test for some time." Dreyer didn't mention the "indentation" in the IC description.


Harold Corwin comments that "Some people have suggested that it was actually found by William Herschel.  This is not true; WH's comment (see Latusseck, J. Astron. Data 14, 4, 2008 where it is reprinted) "Wonderful black space included in Nebulosities" refers to NGC 2024, not to IC 434."


But Wolfgang notes that on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518), WH recorded a large region of nebulosity extending roughly 2° north-south, not far east of IC 434.  He noted "I am pretty sure the places of which these are the boundaries are all full of diffused milky nebulosity; but notwithstanding I used every means of ascertaining it by motion of the telescope, my range was neither far enough, nor sufficiently quick to put it beyond doubt.  He assigned it internal discovery number (1321), which became H. V 35 (first of 4 different fields associated with that designation).  Wolfgang Steinicke feels it may apply to IC 434, though Herschel's RA is about 3 minutes too large, so this identification is very uncertain.

This star forms the southern vertex of an equilateral triangle with mag 7 stars 12' N (SAO 78222 = 11 Gem) and a mag 7.5 star 13' NE.  The illuminating star is at the northwest edge of a large, scattered 15' triangular group of mag 9-13 stars (Cr 89?), with most of the stars forming the outline.

17.5" (1/23/93): fairly faint reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10-11 star. This bi-polar nebula is fairly large, about 2.5' diameter.  Appears to extend further (or is brighter) on the south side.  Bordered by three collinear mag 13 stars on the south side.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 446 = IC 2167, along with IC 2169, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He wrote in his notebook, "a 9 1/2 mag star with largish faint nebula, a little heavier following."


He found it again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the 6" Willard lens and reported on it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Barnard mentioned that he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweeping over this region" as a "10 mag nebulous star about half a degree north preceding 2245."  Apparently Barnard directly sent his original visual discovery to Dreyer, hence the two IC designations (visual and photographic), IC 446 = IC 2167.  This object is a bi-polar reflection nebula. Listed in article on bi-polar nebulae by Ronald Stoyan in Deep Sky Observer #12.

Size 25'x20'


24" (1/31/14): picked up unfiltered at 200x, though low contrast as the entire field is patchy in faint stars and affected by some dust.  Seems roughly 20'x10, elongated N-S and includes several bright stars (Cr 95) with mag 7.9 HD 46005 near the center (illuminating star), mag 8.9 HD 258853 near the south end, and a mag 9.3 star at or beyond the NW end.  The contrast is significantly improved at 125x using a NPB filter and the outline is better defined, particularly at the southern end.  Although the nebulosity is slightly brighter to the south of HD 46005, there are no high surface brightness sections.


18" (2/4/08): at 175x unfiltered, this is a huge, interesting reflection nebula, ~25'x18', elongated N-S with an irregular outline and subtle variations in brightness.  A number of mag 8-10 stars are superimposed, including mag 8 HD 46005 (illuminating star) which is part of a 10' N-S string of four brighter stars on the east side. Nearby reflection nebulae include NGC 2245 ~30' NE, IC 446 35' N and NGC 2247 40' NE (this group forms the association Monoceros R1).


IC 2169 is located two degrees due west of the Christmas Tree cluster and the whole region of bright and dark nebulosity is part of the same molecular cloud complex Mon OB1.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 447 = IC 2169, along with IC 446 = IC 2167, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "1 radius of 80x field [21'] south and 1 radius [21'] preceding the 7 1/2' m star [NGC 2245] is a large nebulosity, faint, that involves several 9 or 9 1/2 mag star.  Nearly 1/2° in size, irregular(?)".  His offset lands in the southern part of the nebula, though clearly he was referring the entire portion.  He picked it up again on 26 Feb 1889 and logged "22' S and 22' p. the neb NGC 2245 is a vL neby, with some bright stars in it.  It is extended N & S nearly, 15 x 12' +/- diam.  There are 3 or 4 9th and 10th mag stars in a curve seemingly connected with it."


Barnard found this reflection nebula again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the Willard 6" lens though and announced it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Barnard stated he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweep over this region, I found a very large, weak, diffused nebulosity some half a degree south of the nebula NGC 2245. This was mixed up with several considerable stars."  His earlier visual discovery was not published but apparently he sent it later to Dreyer, so it was catalogued again as IC 2169.


Barnard retracted his discovery of IC 447 in Lick Publications, Vol 11, incorrectly claiming it to be identical to NGC 2245.  Hubble included this object in his 1922 paper "A general study of diffuse galactic nebula" in Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington, vol. 241, pp.1-38.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 452 = Big. 147, along with IC 453 = Big. 148 on 9 Mar 1890 while searching for NGC 2296.  Swift's discovery position was 0.7 min of RA too far east and 1' too far south, so Bigourdan assumed Big. 147 (later IC 452) was new.  Herbert Howe later measured an accurate RA for NGC 2296 in 1898 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) so, NGC 2296 = IC 452.  His position for Big. 148 (IC 453) points directly to a star, according to Corwin.

Contains a slightly brighter nucleus, which is close southeast of the star.  There may be one or two additional mag 15.5-16 star near the periphery.  Since the galaxy appears to extend from the brighter star it has a comet-like appearance.  Situated in a rich Milky Way star field.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 454 = Sw. IX-16 on 23 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "a faint nebula, elongated with 13 mag star attached to end N.p."  His rough RA (in his notebook) is about 24 seconds too large, but his small field sketch matches.  The discovery was probably not communicated to Dreyer as Barnard isn't credited in the IC.


Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy on 27 Dec 1889 and simply noted "eeF; S; e diff."  Swift's RA is 9 seconds too large and he received the credit in the IC.  Howe measured an accurate position in 1898 and noted, "One or two stars are involved in this nebula."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 455 on 20 Sep 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  While comet hunting in the north, Barnard found NGC 2276, 2300 and IC 455.  He was confused on his pointing direction this far north, but made a field sketch including nearby stars and labeled the nebulae A (NGC 2276), B (NGC 2300) and C (IC 455, outside the 150x field).  He noted "C is 10' S and 3' foll B.  A is 2' diameter, faint, vglbM."  The sketch clearly identifies the three galaxies.  William Denning independently discovered IC 455 less than a month later on 17 Oct 1890 with his 10-inch reflector.  Denning is credited with the discovery in the IC as Barnard never published his discovery or notified Dreyer.

This galaxy, NGC 2300 and IC 512 are the three brightest within 5 degrees of the north celestial pole.  IC 469 resides within an isosceles triangle formed by a mag 9 star 3.8' N, a mag 10 star 4.5' SW and a mag 10.5 star 3.7' SSE.  A 3' group of mag 11-13 stars is close NE, so the surrounding field is very distinctive.

NED identifies the western galaxy as IC 496, while HyperLeda identifies the eastern galaxy as IC 496.  Probably the number should apply to the pair (IC 496A and 496B?).  The eastern object is apparently an interacting (merged) double system.

In August 2017 Courtney Seligman followed up on a group email with Harold Corwin and myself regarding a 10 minute RA error that Swift made on the discovery night,  and found the same correction could be applied to IC 511.  The resulting position (and Swift's description) matches NGC 2646.  This galaxy is "sp of 2" [with IC 520], whereas UGC 4510 and IC 520 are nearly a degree apart.

William Denning discovered IC 512 on 23 Aug 1890 with his 10-inch With-Browning reflector while sweeping for comets at 40x. When he determined it was missing from the NGC, he initially thought it was probably a comet, but reobserved it several times on the morning of the 24th without detecting any motion and concluded it was a new nebula.  Using 145x, he reported it was "very distinct, round, and a little brighter in the middle.  There is a triangle of rather bright telescopic stars on the east side of it."

Since NGC 2947 matches in declination, and the Leander McCormick positions are generally 1 to 2 minutes of RA too large, the identification NGC 2947 = IC 547 is likely.

Lewis Swift found IC 554 = Sw. 10A-1 on 28 Mar 1892 and recorded "eeF, eS, almost stellar."  This was the first object in a short list of 8 nebulae published in MNRAS Vol. LIII, p.273, in his last year observing at the Warner Observatory in Rochester.   There is nothing near his position, but 9' SSE is IC 555 (discovered by Javelle just 6 nights earlier!).  So, likely IC 554 = IC 555.  Courtney Seligman questions this identification due to the discrepant descriptions but Javelle was using a much larger telescope.

NGC 2984 forms a pair with IC 557 7' SE.  The companion appeared faint, very small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, 30"x15", weak concentration, very faint stellar nucleus at moments.  The elongation was not always evident, so often I was just viewing the slightly brighter core.


Stephane Javelle found IC 556 = J. 1-168 on 22 Apr 1892 and reported "F, vS, R, nucleus = 14th mag".  His position matches UGC 5200.


This galaxy was probably discovered by William Herschel on 15 Mar 1784 and catalogued as H III-34 (later h633 and NGC 2984), but his position was unusually poor -- 1 min 19 sec of RA west and 3.5' south of IC 556.  Karl Reinmuth mentioned he couldn't find NGC 2984 in Dreyer's place using Heidelberg plates and questioned if it was equal to IC 556.  This is likely the case as there are no other reasonable candidates for NGC 2984 in the vicinity.  UGC, CGCG and MCG label this galaxy as IC 556 and RNGC calls it NGC 2984.

48" (2/20/12): this unusual system has a dust lane along the major axis and a polar-ring like disc. The galaxy appears as a fairly bright oval, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.6'x0.4', with a small bright core.  There was only a hint of the dust lane but narrow extensions or spikes were visible poking out on the NW and SE end, with the SE extension brighter. A mag 15.2 star is 1.3' NNE and two mag 13 and 14.5 stars are 2.3' SE and 1.7' SE, respectively


There are two close companions but I only noted 2MASX J09543313-0650143 1.2' N.  The observation was made during a period of fairly poor transparency and seeing so this galaxy would be worth revisiting.

At his position is a triple star plus PGC 1537008, an extremely faint galaxy on the southeast side.  I think the galaxy is probably too faint too have been seen by Bigourdan, but the stars certainly could have appeared nebulous.  Corwin notes that NGC 3467 = h793, observed by John Herschel and guest Francis Bailey, *may* apply to IC 656 as the description "Stellar. 2 or 3 stars with a nebulous blur observed by Mr. Bailey", applies better to IC 656 than to the fairly bright galaxy 4.4' W.

Modern catalogues apply IC 694 to one component of the brighter double system.  Despite the good match in position with PGC 35325, I feel it is more likely possible Swift saw the second component of NGC 3690, which is much more obvious in the eyepiece.

Frank Muller found IC 717 on 14 Feb 1888 with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and described it as "1.0'x0.8', E 90°, dif."  With respect to NGC 3775, he measured an offset of +53.92 seconds in RA but no delta for declination.  Apparently he made a 30 second error as NGC 3779 follows by +24 seconds in RA.  His description "E 90° [E-W]" seems to clinch the identification IC 717 = NGC 3779.


Andrew Common discovered NGC 3779 in 1860 with his 36" reflector.  With respect to NGC 3775, he noted "another 5' nf ".  Close to this offset is MCG -02-30-013 = PGC 36084.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position, that was repeated in the IC 2 notes.

A mag 16.3 star is off the southeast side [27" from center].  An extremely faint "star" was noted off the northwest side [25" from center].

This is a Todd discovery and due to a poor position is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  This galaxy is listed as IC 730 (good position from Javelle) in modern catalogues.


Stephane Javelle found IC 730 = J. 2-728 on 22 Mar 1893 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory.  His position matches CGCG 040-040.  This galaxy was first discovered by David Todd on 11 Feb 1878 in his search for trans-Neptunian planets with the 26-inch refractor at the Naval Observatory and reported as Todd 10 (later NGC 3849).  Todd noted a "large and nebulous" object with a star 2' in PA ~210° (SSW).  There is nothing at his rough position, but using Todd's discovery sketch, Harold Corwin identified Todd 10 as CGCG 040-040.  So, IC 730 = NGC 3849.


Most modern catalogues label this galaxy as IC 730 due to the poor NGC position, though Deep Sky Field Guide and Uranometria Sky Atlas use NGC 3849.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

The UGC galaxy is probably more likely to be Swift's IC 731 than MCG +08-21-096 based on visibility, but all modern sources identify as IC 731 as it is a better match in position.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 731 = Sw. IX-32 on 11 May 1890 and reported "vF; vS; R."  There is nothing at his position but 43 seconds of RA west is MCG +08-21-096, which most sources identify as IC 731, though not MCG.  This galaxy is faint enough that Swift would have likely called it "eeF" or even "eeeF".


Yann Pothier proposed that IC 731 may be UGC 6726, which is a much brighter galaxy, but off by +52 seconds in RA and -9 arcminutes in Dec.  Corwin lists this as a slightly more likely possibility (colons).  Finally, IC 731 could be a duplicate of NGC 3870, which lies 38 arcminutes due north of Swift's position.  So, there are no less than 3 reasonable identities, though is no persuasive candidate. See Corwin's notes for more.


Based on the low surface brightness and small size of MCG +08-21-096, I feel Swift would have described this galaxy as "eeF" instead of "vF".  So, I believe that UGC 6726 is more likely the correct object despite being off in both RA and Dec.

24" (5/11/13): moderately bright, large, slightly elongated ~N-S, 1.3'x1.1', diffuse appearance with an ill-defined halo due to low surface brightness around periphery.  But the surface brightness is irregular or mottled with a very small, slightly brighter nucleus and an impression of spiral structure.  Forms a contrasting pair with IC 750 3.4' ESE.  The SDSS image resolves the spiral arms into numerous blue HII regions and that probably contributed to the visual impression of mottling. Mag 8.9 HD 103954 lies 3.1' SW.

Lewis Swift found IC 778 = Sw. VII-19 on 3 Apr 1888 and noted "eF, pS, R, bet 2 st in meridian [N-S], n. one = 13 mag."  There is nothing at his position.  It's possible IC 778 = MCG +09-20-146, though this galaxy is 10' north of Swift's position and 40 seconds of RA east, so it's off in both directions.  Although  MCG +09-20-146 lies between two stars, they are oriented SW-NE and not close to being "in meridian" [N-S].


But Harold Corwin found that if Swift made an error of exactly 5 minutes in RA (too large), then his position matches NGC 4198, which also is bracketed by two stars (oriented NNW-SSE).  The only uncertainty is why did Swift mention the "north one = 13 mag", when the southern star is the brighter one?  Still, this identification is more likely than MCG +09-20-146.

Lewis Swift found IC 799 = Sw. VIII-64 on 21 Apr 1889 and reported "eF; eS; R; ? eF * is in contact on p[receding] side."  His position is just off the east edge of NGC 4520 and his description fits.  William Herschel discovered NGC 4520 = H III-757 on 20 Mar 1789 (sweep 913) and logged "2 vF stars involved in nebulosity, vF, S."  Apparently their positions were just far enough off that neither Swift nor Dreyer realized that IC 799 = NGC 4520.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 809 = Sw. VII-23 on 6 May 1888 and recorded "eF; pS; R; bet. 2 st.; all 3 point to 4621 [M59]."  His position is 1' SW of UGC 7863 and his description clinches this identification.   Schwassmann found it again in 1900 on a plate take by Max Wolf with a 6-inch lens at the Heidelberg Observatory.  Schwassmann's position is accurate (measured on 2 plates) and clearly IC 809 = IC 3672.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 811 = Big. 176 on 13 May 1888.  His position matches NGC 4663, discovered by Tempel in 1883.  Tempel's position was only roughly placed 8' south-following NGC 4658, so Bigourdan apparently thought his object was new.

Although his positions are pretty good, IC 817 is north-following of IC 816, not south-following as Swift stated.

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; the tidal tail north of IC 819 (NNW member of the interacting "Mice" (NGC 4676)) was very prominent as a direct vision streak, extending at least as far as the mag 17.3 star situated 1.6' due north of the center of the galaxy.


48" (4/6/13): IC 819 is the NNW component of a fascinating interacting pair with IC 820 (slightly brighter SSE component), separated by 40" between centers.  At 375x and 488x in soft seeing, IC 819 appeared fairly bright, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 24"x16", high surface brightness. IC 820 was bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 30"x20", high surface brightness, increased to a small, very bright nucleus.  The two galaxies are connected or surrounded by a low surface brightness bridge.  IC 819 has a remarkable bright, long thin tidal tail shooting due north!  The tail has a high surface brightness (brightest feature of this type I've observed in any galaxy) and extends roughly 80"x8", dimming at the north end and ending just east of a mag 17.3 star.


24" (5/22/17): IC 819 = NGC 4676A is the slightly fainter northwest component of the interacting "Mice" duo.  At 375x it appeared faint to fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 15" diameter.  The tidal tail was easily seen as a straight thin extension due north, so the combined galaxy/tail extended ~60"x10".  The tail has only a slightly lower surface brightness than the "head" (core of the galaxy).


17.5": the northwest member (IC 819) of the interacting pair "The Mice" appeared faint, small, low surface brightness, elongated N-S.


Rudolph Spitaler resolved IC 819 and 820, the two components of the "Mice", on 20 Mar 1892 using the 27" Grubb refractor at Vienna.

But 5' S of Swift's position is NGC 4813, which would have been nearby in Swift's wide field view, yet wasn't mentioned.  Corwin lists both galaxies as candidates but assigns the PGC as more likely due to the positional match.

Rudolph Spitaler discovered IC 838 on 24 Feb 1892 with the 27-inch refractor at Vienna, although he confused the main object he reported as new.  His description for Nova 61 (actually NGC 4849) reads, "Brightness and appearance like Nova 58.  Probably identical with Nova d'Arrest [NGC 4849].  Northeast of this nebula, at 1.5', there is still another nebula, but much fainter; Both together form a pretty double nebula."

Truman Safford found IC 843 = Sf. 3, along with IC 842, on 3 May 1866.  This galaxy was probably originally discovered by Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse on 24 Apr 1865 and catalogued as NGC 4913.  On the same observation he discovered NGC 4912, NGC 4916 and IC 4088.  Parsons assumed he was observing the NGC 4914 field, but the discovery sketch that shows 4 nebulae (and one suspected neb) is a reasonably good match with a field 8° further south.  NGC 4913, labeled as Gamma in the diagram, matches IC 843.  Sue French originally suggested this identification.

Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy 10 years later on 28 Mar 1898, in the last couple of months before ending his observing career at Lowe Observatory.  His position for Sw.

Lewis Swift found IC 895 = Sw. VIII-75 on 1 Sep 1888 and reported "vF; pL; R; * in center ? D[ouble]."  There is nothing near his position.  The closest galaxy he might have picked up is NGC 5240, but his position is well off in RA (3 minutes 40 sec) and over 4' in declination.  Without finding a suitable candidate, Harold Corwin listed this number as lost.  But in August 2017, I noticed that if I added 10 minutes of RA to Swift's position, this landed just off the northeast edge of NGC 5273 (discovered by William Herschel), and Swift's description is a good match with his galaxy.  This assumes he missed nearby, but much fainter, NGC 5276.  Swift apparently also made a 10 minute error in recording the RA of IC 1943, discovered in 1897 near the end of his observing career.


When I contacted Corwin about this find, he noticed that the same 10 minutes of RA correction applied to IC 1028 and IC 1045, discovered on the same night!  This results in IC 1028 = NGC 5739 and IC 1045 = UGC 9559, instead of the identifications IC 1028 = UGC 9368 in modern catalogues 15' SE of Swift's position and IC 1045 = NGC 5731?, from Corwin.  Finally, Courtney Seligman found that IC 511, the 4th and last object discovered that night, shares the same 10 minute error (see that number).  So, due to the common error of all 4 objects, these new identifications are secure.

All modern sources (except for NED) misidentify IC 897 as UGC 8544, a thin edge-on located 10' SW.  Bigourdan, who discovered IC 897, unfortunately misidentified his offset star and when his offsets are applied to the star he noted, the position falls close to UGC 8544.  But when the correct offset star is used, the identification of IC 897 = CGCG 102-20 is matched.  This identification also agrees with his offsets for IC 897 from NGC 5217.


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 897 = Big. 180 on 20 May 1890 and noted "Magnitude 13.5; situated from NGC 5217 at a PA of 105, Dist. = 3.5 arcmins."  His published position in Comptes Rendus (used by Dreyer in the IC) happens to fall near UGC 8544 = CGCG 102-016 and modern catalogues have taken this galaxy as IC 897.  Malcolm Thomson sorted out the correct identification (see "The True Identity of IC 897" in Deep Sky Observer #136) as well as Harold Corwin's identification notes.

E.E. Barnard and Sherburne Burnham discovered IC 923 in a group around June 1892 with the 36" Lick refractor.  Harold Corwin identifies IC 923 with LEDA 3483133, situated 1' SSW of Barnard's position.  Wolfgang Steinicke identifies LEDA 3483133 as IC 922 and labels LEDA 2508355 (very close to Barnard's position) as IC 923.  Hubble, in his 1917 PhD thesis on "Photographic investigations of faint nebulae", stated LEDA 3483133 (#43 in his table) was "very probably" IC 925.  Due to Barnard's generally poor positions in the cluster, the identification is uncertain. See IC 917 for more.

48" (5 /9/18): very faint, very small, round, ~8" diameter.  Can almost hold continuously with averted vision once noticed.  The problem is this galaxy is situated just under 1' NW of mag 7.2 HD 119821, which strongly hinders viewing.  A tight group of 7 galaxies in the core of AGC 1783 is just a couple of arcminutes west.  Two mag 12.5 and 11.6 stars are collinear with the bright star, 0.9' E and 1.7' E.

See observing notes for NGC 5360.  Identification uncertain and probably should be classified as not found.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 958 = Sw. IX-39 on 19 Apr 1890 and reported "eeeF; pS; iR; seen only by glimpses."  His position is 3.5' NE of NGC 5360 and this is the favored identification by Harold Corwin.   But there are two question marks about this identification; there is no mention of brighter NGC 5364 8' ENE, which would have been in the same field.  Also his description implies a marginally visible object while NGC 5360 should have been more evident to Swift.  Yann Pothier suggests CGCG 046-033 = PGC 49845 could be Swift's object.  This would imply a 5.5 minute error in RA.  His argument is this galaxy is fainter than NGC 5360 (and more appropriate to be called "eeeF") and is isolated as opposed to NGC 5360.  As an alternative, Yann suggests a faint double star 22 seconds of RA due west of Swift's position.  So, this identification has plenty of uncertainty.

Corwin notes that "he caught the identity later when he was preparing his complete observations for publication."  Assuming the same star fooled both Tempel and Bigourdan, this is the only known case where a single star has both an NGC and IC designation!

18" (6/18/04): faint, very small, round. The view is a bit confused by a very faint star which is close south (~20") so these objects could initially appear to be a faint, close double. The galaxy appeared only 10" or so in diameter. Barely visible with direct vision though only a faint stellar nucleus remained. Faintest of trio with IC 997 and IC 4401 and situated 5' ENE of IC 997.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 998 = Sw. 10A-5 = Sw. XI-169, along with IC 997, on 16 May 1892 (last two months at the Warner Observatory) and recorded "eeF; S; R; following of 2 [with IC 997]."  This galaxy is the faintest of a quartet, but Swift's offset from IC 997 points directly to this galaxy.  Swift reobserved it again on 16 Sep 1896 from Echo Mountain in Southern California and reported it as new in his 11th discovery list, probably to make sure Dreyer didn't miss this discovery.  Herbert Howe took LEDA 1058483 as IC 998 when he observed the field carefully around 1900 and also discovered IC 4401. But Malcolm Thomson argues against this identification.  See his detailed analysis in IC identifications.  Also see Corwin's comments on IC 997/998.

24" (7/1/19): at 375x; between fairly faint and moderately bright, fairly small, very elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 35"x15", slightly brighter nucleus.  Forms a similar pair with IC 1000 2.2' SE.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 999 = J. 1-283, along with IC 1000, on 23 Jun 1892.  His position is off the east side of the galaxy (same error as IC 1000; likely due to an imprecise position for his offset star).
