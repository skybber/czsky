Hermann Kobold discovered IC 4040 = K. 2-29 on 8 May 1896 with the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg and recorded "vF, S, R, = B 306?."  Kobold's position corresponds with CGCG 160-252 = PGC 44789 and all modern sources identify this galaxy as IC 4040.  But Malcolm Thomson found that Bigourdan's #306, which Dreyer lists as the primary observer, refers to PGC 44792 (with attached star), which is 2.5' south of Kobold's object.  Dreyer used Kobold's micrometric position, but Bigourdan's observation is nearly 5 years earlier.  Thomson argues that based on prior discovery, IC 4040 should perhaps apply to Bigourdan's system, instead of the modern identification.

Dreyer used Kobold's position for IC 4051, which matches NGC 4908.  But as William Herschel picked up the brighter galaxy (H. III-363 = NGC 4908), then IC 4051 should apply to the fainter galaxy to the NNW.  As a result, the modern identities are reversed.

In his fifth discovery list, he described in the narrative portion, "In case of nebula NGC 4933 I made the remark years ago: certainly double, has a bright stellar nebula south preceding, 13m in the middle; the north following is large; Distance from each other a little over 1 '. A later remark is: fine elongated nebula with two knots, the brighter one north; on the southern tip of a faint stellar nebula"


Bigourdan independently resolved the two components (Big. 315 and 316) on 16 Apr 1895 while searching for NGC 4933, but he assumed these were new objects. Bigourdan is credited with the discovery in the IC.  See NGC 4933 for this story.  Gerard de Vaucouleurs assigned the letter suffixes NGC 4933A (for the southwest galaxy) and NGC 4933B in the 1964 "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies".

48" (4/21/17): NGC 4933 is a double system consisting of compact NGC 4933A = IC 4173 on the southwest side and NGC 4933B = IC 4176 on the northeast end, separated by 45" between centers.  At 488x, NGC 4933B appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 or 3:2 SW-NE, ~1.0'x0.7'.  Sharply concentrated with an intensely bright nucleus.  The north side has a sharper light cut off [due to dust].  Located 7' NE of mag 7.9 HD 113425.


17.5" (5/17/90): moderately bright, moderately large, dominated by a bright core, faint extensions 2:1 SW-NE.  Forms a contact pair with IC 4173 at the west edge in a common halo (Arp 176).


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 4176 = Big. 316, along with IC 4173 = Big. 315, on 16 Apr 1895.  There is nothing near his positions for either object, but Harold Corwin found that Bigourdan misidentified his offset star.  Once corrected his position corresponds with the two components of NGC 4933, with IC 4176 the brighter and larger northeastern galaxy. Gerard de Vaucouleurs assigned the letter suffixes NGC 4933A (for the southwest galaxy) and NGC 4933B in the 1964 "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies".

18" (7/7/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright, compact planetary was picked up by blinking with an OIII filter at 128x.  IC 4191 forms the northern vertex of a small, distinctive triangle with a mag 10.6 star 1.1' SE and a slightly fainter mag 11 star 1.6' SSW.  Excellent contrast gain of 2-3 magnitudes using the OIII filter.  Without a filter, the planetary has that distinctive bluish color of planetaries and is slightly non-stellar with an extremely high surface brightness.  At 293x a very small disc, perhaps 4"-5" in size is visible.  The magnitude appears very similar to the mag 10.6 star 1.1' SE.  Located 40' WNW of mag 4.8 Eta Muscae.

Lewis Swift found IC 4338 = Sw. XI-161 on 20 Apr 1897 and recorded "vL, eF, C E n & s; in field with 5334.  A F st close to each end of major axis."  His RA is just 0.2 minutes west of NGC 5334.  In his earlier Lowe Observatory discovery list, he has a note reading "This is a remarkable object.  I have never seen one just like it.  It resembles an elliptical planetary nebula.  The light is evenly diffused, and the limb sharp as a planet.  Strange, Sir William Herschel missed it, being so near his III 665 [NGC 5334].  Munich 9619 is nf 121 seconds."  But there is only one galaxy here, so it's unclear what other object Swift is referring to.  See Harold Corwin's notes.  The discovery date may be 30 Apr 1897 as Swift stated in his second list of Lowe Observatory discoveries.  There was a 6 month gap in his discoveries due to a trip back east and his wife's death.

Swift included this object in a short article in the 1902 Popular Astronomy titled "Remarkable Nebulae".  He wrote "this is a beautiful nebulous star of the 8th mag exactly in the center of a nebulous atmosphere, whose outlines are a sharp as the planet Jupiter."

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this is a very striking planetary with an unusual appearance.  The main body is bright and boxy, roughly 25" diameter with a bluish color.  A number of mag 14 stars appear to huddle around the planetary including a mag 13.5 star at the west end and some additional mag 13 stars are within 2'.  Much fainter extensions or wings are just visible extending E-W from the main body with the western wing slightly more prominent (though this may be due to the superimposed star).  The wings are more obvious when a UHC filter is used.  At 293x, there are three collinear stars just off the west edge with the western extension encompassing the closest star.  The wings increase the overall dimensions to ~60"x25".


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 140x this bright bipolar planetary appeared fairly small, 20"-25" diameter with a high surface brightness and a bluish color.  The outline is unusual, appearing somewhat boxy or rectangular in appearance.  A faint star is just off the west edge.  At 195x there appeared to be very faint extensions ~E-W, increasing the dimensions to 2:1.


13.1" (3/17/86): fairly bright and prominent with a Daystar 300 filter although viewed at a low elevation.  Fairly small, 35" diameter, smooth disc.  Visually appeared almost round although photos reveal a very elongated shape.  No central star seen at 214x.  A mag 13.5 star is just off the west edge.


13.1" (6/18/85): viewed for 1-2 minutes as it appeared and disappeared just east of Fremont Peak from Coulter Row.  Appeared fairly bright and fairly small and roundish.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4406 = D.S. 403 = Fleming 94 in 1901 on a Harvard objective prism plate from Arequipa (1901HarCi..60....1P).  DeLisle Stewart also found this planetary on a plate taken in 1899 at Harvard's Arequipa Station, though published in 1908.  He noted "2 nebulous stars make dumb-bell, remarkable."  Finally, Robert Innes independently found it a third time while observing with the 7-inch Metz refractor of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.  He wrote, "As seen with the 7-inch on 14 August 1901 this is a fine planetary nebula, 10th magnitude, about 20" in diameter. Examined on the same night with the 18-inch telescope, it appears dumb-bell-shaped..."  Perhaps surprisingly, John Herschel missed this fairly bright planetary.

William Henry Finlay discovered IC 4407 on 20 Sep 1883 with either the 6-inch or 7-inch refractor at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope.  There is nothing at his position, roughly determined using circle readings.  PGC, HyperLEDA, RC3 and SIMBAD identify MCG -01-37-005 as IC 4607.  This galaxy has a similar declination as Finlay's position and the RA is 2.5 minutes smaller.  But this low surface brightness 14th mag galaxy is likely much too faint to have been seen by Finlay.  Assuming Finlay made an error in determining the RA (time), Harold Corwin suggests IC 4407 may be a duplicate of NGC 5324, which is about 37 minutes of RA west of Finlay's position.

Instead IC 4441 is much more likely applies to ESO 272-014, a much brighter galaxy only 16 seconds of RA east of his position, though 6' further north.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x this globular has an unusual appearance as a round glow of nearly even surface brightness, ~3.5' diameter with a single brighter mag 12 star superimposed near the very center.  A brighter mag 10.5 field star is just off the south edge, 2' from the center.  IC 4499 appears similar to a large, fairly low surface brightness planetary or reflection nebula.  This observation was possibly compromised by some clouds as the skies completely clouded up soon afterwards, but there was no evident resolution at this power.


DeLisle Stewart found IC 4499 = D.S. 418 on a plate taken on 13 Jun 1901 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  He noted "vF Cl, 4' diam., 3 F st inv in cl, position approximate, susp."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4572 = J. 3-1380 visually, probably along with IC 4569, on 29 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  His position of 15h 36m 53s +28° 25' (1889) corresponds with a group of IC galaxies (IC 4568, 4569, 4570, 4572, 4574), but is closest to IC 4572 and IC 4570.  The southeast galaxy on his simple sketch (probably IC 4572) is noted as "pF, pL, gbM, Rndish."  The northwest galaxy (either IC 4570 or IC 4569) is noted as "pS, gbM, Rndish."  The sketch of the 80x field shows a single star - probably mag 8.4 SAO 83949 = HD 140253.  If the field diameter is close to 40', then the second galaxy is more likely IC 4569 (separation of 17'), which has a higher surface brightness and was more evident in my visual observation.


Stephane Javelle found this galaxy again on 25 Jul 1895 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory and measured an accurate position.  Barnard didn't publish his discovery or notify Dreyer so Javelle was credited with the discovery in the IC.

Both of these galaxies appear out of place as large, somewhat ghostly (low surface brightness) galaxies in a rich star field.  I might have assume they were faint emission nebulae. After the observation I found the secondary was dewed over and this likely degraded the view.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4587 on 27 Apr 1903 while observing the variable star (recurrent nova) T Corona Borealis, normally around 10th magnitude (currently mag ~9.2) but blazed to second magnitude in 1866 and third magnitude in 1946.  From 1903 to 1907, he periodically looked for evidence of a change in color or indication of a non-stellar appearance using the Yerkes 40-inch refractor.  In a report published in ApJ, 25, 279 (1907), he reported, "While examining the star, I found a faint nebula in the field with it, following.  The nebula is of the 14th or 15th magnitude, and is from 5" to 10" in diameter, without any nucleus."  This object is apparently Barnard's last visual discovery.

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4593 = Fleming 96 in 1907 on a Harvard objective prism plate.  Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) described, "Central star about mag 10.  This is surrounded by a disk of brighter matter 11" in diameter, fading out a little towards the edges.  There is a bright wing at the north end in pa 347°, and a smaller and fainter projection opposite this; fainter matter outside brings the whole diameter to about 15"."


The Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebula, Sky Catalogue 2000.0 and the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas has the wrong RA of 16h 12.2m.  At this position on the U2000 is a mag 9 star as IC 4593 was recorded as a star in the BD catalogue.

18" (7/12/10): immediately noticed at 108x while viewing Barnard 41 (about 15' NE).  This large reflection nebula (part of Rho Ophiuchi complex) contains two bright, striking pairs at 47" (SHJ 225 = 7.4/8.1) and 13" (SHJ 226 = 7.6/8.4).  Both of these pairs are encased within a large, obvious hazy glow with an irregular, elongated shape oriented NW-SE.  The glow was faintly visible in my 80mm finder at 13x.


13.1" (7/5/83): appears as a large, slightly milky and starless region involving two pretty double stars (SHJ 225 = 7.4/8.1 at 47" and SHJ 226 = 7.6/8.3 at 13") and a single star to the west.  This triangular region appears "lighter" than the surrounding background with a Deep Sky filter.  The north side has a more definite edge.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4601 on a plate taken 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.

17.5" (6/30/00): this is a large, circular glow surrounding a 4' pair of mag 8/10 stars and part of the Rho Ophiuchi complex (2° north of Antares).  The nebulosity extends roughly 8'-10' in diameter.  The setting is quite eerie as the 50' field is nearly devoid of all stars - just two other faint stars. The field has a dull gray appearance as if it was weakly luminous.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4603, along with IC 4604, around 1883, probably with his 5" refractor.  In his 1895 paper "On a great photographic nebula near Antares", he stated "for fully ten or twelve years I have known of a vast region of nebulosity in Scorpius near Antares."  In addition he referred to a note made 15 June 1892, "A couple of years ago [at Lick Observatory] I found 2 stars involved in a very large diffused nebulosity.  They are strongly nebulous in the 6.5" and in the 12", but are best seen in the 6.5".  The stars are about 8.5 and 9.5 mag, the following star being the brighter.  They are 1.8° north and 42' preceding Antares [apparently IC 4603].  This region and preceding it for some distance seems to consist of a vast but very diffused nebulosity."  At Lick he took an image of region on 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory. He noted "the brighter and more complicated portions of the nebula center about Rho Ophiuchi, 22 Scorpii and a couple of small stars occupying the center of the equilateral triangle formed by Rho Oph, 22 and Sigma Scorpii."  The "couple of small stars occupying the center" are involved with IC 4603.

The glow appears most evident around the bright star.  The dusty surrounding field (Barnard 42) is nearly empty of stars.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4604, the Rho Ophiuchi Nebula, around 1883 using his 5" refractor.  See notes on IC 4603.


Caroline Herschel, in a letter to her nephew John Herschel, wrote she "once heard your father, after a long awful silence, exclaim "Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel! [Here is truly a hole in the heavens!]”.  She added her brother returned to this unique region several nights over several years.  Caroline urged John to search for this object in the lower part of Scorpion during his trip to South Africa.  John sent Caroline a letter from the Cape of Good Hope dated 22 Feb 1835 in which he stated the region near Rho Ophiuchi contained fields “without the smallest star."  In 1928 Johann Hagen, director of the Vatican Observatory, claimed William Herschel's "Hole in the heavens” referred to B86, but Joseph Ashbrook stated it referred to the Rho Oph region in an "Astronomical Scrapbook” column.

As with other sections of the nebula, the surrounding field is strangely devoid of stars and the background has a grayish sheen as if it is feebly glowing.  Barnard 44 is a huge dark lane that extends roughly 6° ENE.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4605 on a plate taken 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.

William Henry Finlay discovered IC 4606 on 26 Dec 1886 with either the 6-inch or 7-inch refractor at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope.  There is nothing at his position, though the RA is only roughly given to the nearest minute.  ESO reports the number as not found and Harold Corwin called it lost.  But in 2004 David Frew suggest that IC 4606 "is just an observation of the globular cluster NGC 6144 with an error in position [4.3 min of time too large]. His description fits perfectly: "follows a faint star 4.5 secs., and is 0.5 [arcmin] S."  There is a 12th magnitude star on the north-preceding side of the core, so this identification seems very plausible.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 4611 = J. 3-1397, along with IC 4610, on 25 Jul 1902.  There is nothing at his position, but Harold Corwin and Malcolm Thomson found that Javelle must have reserved the offset sign from his comparison star.  Once corrected, his re-reduced position falls directly on MCG +07-34-112 = PGC 58498.  Dreyer copied this error into the IC 2 and as a result modern sources (except for NED) fail to identify this galaxy as IC 4611.

18" (6/12/10): this large HII region is embedded in the northern half of Tr 24, a sprawling 60' cluster just north of NGC 6231.  At 108x and UHC filter IC 4628 stood out as a very large, fairly bright glow within Tr 24.  The main glow was elongated E-W, roughly 30'x12' with mag 7.2 HD 152723 just off the south side.  The northern side has a fairly well-defined edge and a number of mag 8-10 stars are embedded along the southwest and west end of the nebulosity.  A fainter extension begins on the east end and extends northeast for ~15', ending in a brighter HII patch (G345.31+01.47) peppered with several stars and involving the infrared cluster [DBS2003] 114.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): this is an emission nebula on the north side of a large open cluster Tr 24 = H12.  Appears fairly faint, very large, about 30'x10' diameter and clearly elongated E-W.  Shows up best with the UHC filter at 83x although visible without a filter.  Includes some brighter portions.  Also visible in the 16x80 finder with a UHC filter.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4628 between 1892 and 1895 on a plate taken at Lick Observatory.  In Lick Publications Vol 11, 1913, Plate 37 he describes: "The coarse cluster in 16h 48m, -40.3° does not seem to be in Dreyer's lists.  It is a very interesting object and appears to be connected by a scattering chain of stars, with the cluster [NGC] 6231 south of it.  In its northern part is the nebula IC 4628.  This was originally discovered on a plate with the Willard lens, but no announcement was made of it.  It is a large nebula one half degree in diameter and of irregular form and brightness.  A photograph with the 10-inch Bruce telescope at Mount Wilson in 1905 (June 21) shows the irregular group of stars and the nebula very beautifully.  There are still fainter portions that extend half a degree to the northeast.  The nebulosity, apparently, does not condense about any one of the stars and is probably not actually connected with the cluster."  Royal Harwood Frost also found IC 4628 = F. 1148 on a photographic place taken in 1903 at Harvard's Arequipa station and both are credited in the IC.

11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): IC 4651 was first noticed in my 10x30 IS binoculars while looking at NGC 6352.  It was seen as an obvious knot 1.5° to the south.  At 127x, I was surprised to find a beautifully rich open cluster with over 100 stars mag 10-13.5 in at least a 15' field.  The stars are fairly uniform in distribution with a weak central concentration, though several form loops and chains surrounding blank regions.  The brightest star (mag 8.9 K3-type) is on the east side. This is an intermediate-age cluster between 1-2 billion years old.  Located 1° west of mag 2.8 Alpha Arae.


James Dunlop discovered IC 4651= D 402 on 28 Jul 1826 and described "a very fine round cluster of very small stars, slightly compressed to the centre, about 8' diameter."  His position is on the south side of the cluster, so the identification is certain.


Solon Bailey rediscovered the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII, 1908).

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this irregular galaxy has a disrupted appearance or perhaps is interacting with a companion.  The structure is difficult to separate but the brighter component on the northeast side is moderately bright, small, elongated WNW-ESE.  Attached on the south side is a larger, but fainter extension oriented nearly perpendicular to the brighter component.  A faint star is at the edge.  IC 4662 is located just 10' NE of mag 3.7 Eta Pavonis and the bright star interferes with viewing if left in the field.


According to the article "Star formation in the irregular galaxy IC 4662" (A&A, 1990, 234, 99) the elongated knot on the northeast side contains two giant HII regions comparable to the 30 Doradus complex!  IC 4662 is identical to He 2-269 (PK 328-17.1), which Karl Henize included in a 1967 list of planetary nebulae discovered through H-alpha emission on objective prism plates.  In a 1970 paper, Pastoriza gave the classification as a nearby dwarf emission line galaxy with a radial velocity of ~400 km/sec (less than 10 million l.y.).


Robert Innes discovered IC 4662 visually in 1901 with the 7-inch Merz refractor at the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted "a faint oval nebula 1' in diameter, N.p. Eta Pavonis.  Found with the 7-inch."  Based on plates taken at Arequipa, DeLisle Stewart noted "F, S, irr, 2 st. inv."  Stewart referenced Innes' discovery announcement in MN 62, 470.

Philippe de Chéseaux discovered IC 4665 in 1745-46.  Although his list of nebulae was presented to the Académie des Sciences in 1746 it was not generally known until published by Bigourdan in 1892.  John Bode independently discovered the cluster around 1782 and as well as Caroline Herschel on 31 Jul 1783.  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" (f/13) Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in the 1908 "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.

Joseph Lunt discovered IC 4670 visually in 1901 with the Cape Observatory 24-inch refractor (the "Victoria Spectroscopic Telescope" erected in 1898) fitted with an object-glass prism.  He described it was stellar and mag 12-13 and situated "immediately S.f. C.P.D. -21[deg] 6502".  He noted "The nebula is 2.5 seconds preceding a slightly brighter star of the same declination."  It was also photographed on 2 plates in 1901. Although his position is 3.5' too far south, the identification is certain.


Hubble reported IC 4670 as a new planetary after it was found on plates taken in 1920 with a 10-inch Cooke Astrographic Lens with objective prisms attached.  The equivalence with IC 4670 was not noticed by the ESO catalogue (1982).  Kent Wallace reported IC 4670 = Hb 6 in 1990.

Excellent view at 375x; irregularly round, slightly elongated ~NW-SE, slightly clumpy rim.  Situated 30" of a mag 12 star that forms the southwest vertex of a small "Keystone" asterism.  A 7" pair of stars is 2' WSW with a third wider star to the north.  No central star visible.


18" (8/14/07): picked up at 174x as a very small, round disc.  Excellent response to a UHC filter and appeared to increase in size.  Best view was at 300x, which showed a well-defined 15" disc.  Located close 30" SW of a mag 12 star and 2' ENE of a mag 10 star.  The mag 12 star forms the western vertex of a small trapezoid of mag 11-12 stars with sides 1'-2'.  At 73x this planetary shares the same field, 45' N of NGC 6520 and ultra dark B86.


18" (7/16/07): at 225x and UHC filter appears as a moderately bright mag 13 disc of just 15" diameter with a sharp, crisply defined halo.  A mag 12 star lies 33" NE.  At 323x the western side was perhaps slightly brighter.  Located 45' N of Barnard 86/NGC 6520.  A very faint planetary, M 2-26, lies 8' NNW.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4673 on 19 Aug 1895 while making measures of the diameter of Ceres with the 36-inch Lick refractor.  He described it as "round, slightly ill defined, of uniform brightness and no central star.  The measured diameter of this object was 13.6".  I should class it as being of the 13th magnitude."

17 58 16.0 +66 37 59; Dra


48" (4/1/11): IC 4677 appeared as a prominent, triangular or wedge-shaped knot with the vertex pointing east, situated 1.8' due west of center near the edge of the outer halo of NGC 6543 (Cat's Eye Nebula). This shock-excited condensation or "flier (flocculi) appeared much larger than previously seen, ~50"x30", and brighter along a well-defined, straight southern edge.  The north side is brightest near the east end at the vertex.  A 15th magnitude star lies 45" NE and a mag 9.8 star is 1.2' NW.  A second fainter (uncatalogued) knot in the outer halo is located 2.6' ESE of center, just 30" N of a mag 14.5 star.  This knot was only 15"-20" in size and had a low surface brightness.


18" (6/20/04): easily visible at 160x using a UHC filter as a slightly elongated, low surface brightness glow 1.7' W of center of NGC 6543 and 1.5' SE of a mag 11 star which lies 2.7' WNW of NGC 6543.  This shock-excited knot in the outer halo was elongated 3:2 SW-NE, roughly 20"x13".  At 225x it was barely visible unfiltered, but could be held continuously at this power adding a UHC filter.


17.5" (6/3/00): at 140x with a UHC filter, this ionized knot in the outer halo of the Cat's Eye was faint but clearly visible as a low surface brightness arc, located just south of the midpoint of the line connecting the geometric center of the PN with a mag 11 star 2.7' NW.


17.5" (11/1/97): this unusual object is a irregular knot in the outer halo of NGC 6543 1.7' W of center and appearing visually completely detached from the bright planetary.  Suspected at 220x without filtration close to a mag 15 star located 1' NW of the planetary.  Using a UHC filter, IC 4677 is clearly visible with averted vision as a very faint elongated patch, ~25"x15" oriented SW-NE.  Requires averted for a good view but can almost hold continuously.  Also visible at 140x with OIII filter and 280x with the UHC, but 220x provided the best view.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4677 on 24 Apr 1900 with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor, apparently visually.  Harold Corwin comments that Vorontsov-Velyaminov "included it in his first list [1959] of interacting galaxies (where it is No. 121), and in the MCG (it is MCG +11-22-017).  This is a bit surprising as VV was an early authority on planetary nebulae; his book from the 1930's is now something of a classic on the topic.  Still, the object does look something like a distorted late barred spiral on the PSS prints."  IC 4677 is now known to be a shock-excited knot (or FLIER) in the halo of NGC 6543.

17.5" (7/20/96): at 82x, very subtle glow around a pair of mag 8.5/10 stars.  Somewhat difficult at low power to identify with certainty due to location in a rich Milky Way field and the nearby nebulous glow from M8.  Better at 140x-220x, where a fairly obvious 3' glow is visible.  No noticeable improvement with filters.


17.5" (6/8/96): at 220x a low surface brightness halo of 3' diameter is visible around a pair of mag 8/9 stars at 50" separation.  Very weak if any enhancement with OIII filter (reflection nebula?).  On photos the nebula is centered on the fainter SW mag 9 star.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4678 photographically using the 10-inch Bruce telescope at Mt. Wilson in July 1905. In describing the region surrounding M8 (see AN 4239), he mentioned "There is a small, elongated nebula in the position 1860.0 17h 59m 25s± -23d 53m±".  Although there is nothing at that location, Harold Corwin suggests this refers to a small nebula northeast of M8, located about 1.5 min of RA west of Barnard's position, and centered at 18 06 32.3 -23 57 31.

13.1" (8/17/85): a thin dark "finger" extends towards the cluster, positioned just south and beyond the two bright mag 9 stars near the center.  This is an extension of the wider projection seen previously several times and which is better defined along the south edge.


13.1" (8/15/82): the "Eagle Nebula" is a fairly bright 30' nebulosity in a striking outstretched eagle shape with a bright scattered cluster superimposed.  There is a considerable contrast gain to the nebulosity using a UHC or OIII filter.  With a UHC filter, a dark projection (called the "Star Queen") enters on the southeast edge of the nebula and extends inward to the west. The cluster members surrounding the "head" of the eagle include ten mag 8-10 stars and a bright pair of mag 8.5 stars (8.2/8.8 at 27").  A dark triangular wedge is visible off the north side.


13.1" (5/26/84): the dark protrusion was fairly easy at 88x.


Isaac Roberts found IC 4703, the nebulosity involved in M16, on a photograph taken with his 20" reflector in 1894.  Although De Chéseaux discovered M16 between 1745-46, he only mentioned a star cluster and even William Herschel just described the stars using his 12-inch reflector: "Large stars with small ones among them; within a small compass I counted more than 50, and there must be at least 100 without taking a number of straggling ones, everywhere dispersed in the neighborhood."


Although Roberts is credited with the discovery in the IC, Wolfgang Steinicke notes in his book on the history of the NGC that Etienne Trouvelot made a visual discovery in 1876 with the USNO 26-inch refractor.  Trouvelot mentioned "..described by Sir J. Herschel as a loose cluster of at least 100 stars, I have found to be involved in an extensive, although not very bright, nebula, which seems to have escaped his scrutiny.  In a study and drawing of this nebula made in 1876, its general form is that of an open fan, with the exception that handle is wanting, with deeply indented branches on the preceding side, where the brightest stars of the cluster are grouped.  From this peculiar form, this object might be appropriately be called the Fan Nebula."


Independently, Robert Innes, observing in 1914 at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, reported "with the 9-inch refractor the nebula is just visible and it fills the perimeter of the cluster with faint extensions beyond."

The western star corresponds with IC 4706.  Only a weak contrast gain was noticed using an OIII filter, so this must be a low excitation region.  At the southeast edge of the field a portion of M17 is visible - IC 4706/4707 is probably an outlying patch of the Swan Nebula.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4706 and 4707 photographically in Jul/Aug 1905  using the 10-inch Bruce telescope at Mt. Wilson.  In describing the region surrounding M17 = Swan Nebula (see AN 4239), he wrote, "Preceding the brightest portion of the nebula, by about 15', are two small stars involved in a small nebulosity.  These stars are BD -16°4812 [IC 4706] and -16°4813 [IC 4707] of the 9.2 and 9.4 magnitudes."  Harold Corwin notes that Barnard misidentified the BD stars, which should read BD -16°4811 [IC 4706] and -16°4812 [IC 4707].  As a result the IC positions are in error (particularly for IC 4707).

18 16 54 -18 31; Sgr

Size 120'x60''


8" (7/3/80): IC 4715 refers to the remarkable Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (prominent naked eye object).  Best view at very low power as it extends beyond the edges of the field.  The rich open cluster NGC 6603 is embedded in the NE side.


Charles Messier "discovered" M24 = "Small Sagittarius Star Cloud" = IC 4715  telescopically on 20 Jun 1764, although it is of course a prominent naked-eye object.  E.E. Barnard photographed the region in 1905 and described in AN 4239 ("Some notes on nebulae and nebulosities"), "The magnificent star cloud...is remarkable for the definiteness and angularity of its south and following outlines.  The east side is about 42' long and is very straight.  The south side is somewhat irregular and much longer.  The run south preceding for about 90' and then joins the great bed of nebulous matter just described.  The northern edge of this star cloud is diffused.  In the cloud towards its northern edge, are two remarkable black holes..."   His position, though, was 10 min of RA too large, so Dreyer didn't recognize it as M24.  Brent Archinal caught the error and made the equivalence (see Corwin's identification notes).  William Herschel apparently first observed M24 on 2 Aug 1783 with his 12-inch and noted "considerable stars in great number."  John Herschel lists his cluster h2004 = NGC 6603 as M24, so he didn't realize the Messier entry applied to the entire star cloud, not the small embedded cluster.

Burnham's "Celestial Handbook", MOL (Master Optical List) and the NGC 2000.0 catalogue (Sinnott) misclassify this galaxy as a planetary nebula. This error stems from Harlow Shapley's 1936 paper "Five Planetary Nebulae and a Globular Cluster" in Harvard Bulletin #902, 193. The first and most famous in this paper being the "Fine Ring Nebula" Shapley 1 in Norma and this object is Shapley 5.  Evans and Thackeray (1950) state "We find (Plate II, Fig. 20) a curious round object of diameter about 19" with three distinct nuclei running along a north-south line across it. The designation as a planetary again seems doubtful."  Perek and Kohoutek rejected the PN classification in the 1967 Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae with the comments "Not a planetary", Henize, private communication; "doubtful planetary", Evans, Thackeray, 1950.

Solon Bailey found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" Cooke lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII, 1908).   Dreyer equated IC 4725 with M25, but though credited Bailey with the position.

Size 52'


15x50mm IS binoculars (6/19/09): large, naked-eye patch within the western branch of the Milky Way.  Beautifully resolved in 15x50's.


17.5" (7/26/95): overfills 50' field with 20 Nagler.  Contains roughly 70 stars brighter than mag 11 and too many faint stars to count.  There are two mag 6.5 stars near the northwest and southeast ends of the cluster (the latter star is not physical member) at the edges of the field (46' separation).  There are no rich subgroups or central concentration but many stars are arranged in long chains and curving loops.  The most prominent is a long chain oriented NW-SE through the center.  Visible as a naked-eye patch at the edge of the Milky Way.


10x50 binoculars (9/9/83):very bright, very large, consists of mag 7 and fainter stars.  Includes many chains and knots over a one degree field!  Larger but not as conspicuous as nearby NGC 6633 in Ophiuchus.  Easy naked-eye cluster in dark sky.


Solon Bailey found IC 4756 in 1896 on a plate taken with a 1" Cooke lens at the Arequipa station in Peru (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No VIII, 1908) and is credited with the discovery in the IC2.  But it was discovered visually by Reverend Thomas Webb by 1859 with his 3.7" Tully refractor.  In the listing for NGC 6633 in his "Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes" (1859) Webb wrote, "Between it [NGC 6633] and Theta, nearer the former, is a beautiful large cloud of stars, chiefly 8 or 9 mag., a nearer part, apparently, of the Galaxy: visible to the naked-eye, and requiring a large field."  The nickname "Graff's Cluster" comes from German astronomer Kasimir Graff, who independently discovered it in 1922.

17.5" (8/2/97): this galaxy is located just 2.0' following a mag 6 star (HD 174262) and the view is severely hampered by the bright star!  At 220x, this object is visible as a very faint and small, round disc, ~15" in diameter.  A better view was at 420x with the 4.8 Nagler where the unconcentrated galaxy is well separated from the bright star.  When the bright star exited the field the galaxy was quite easy to view due to its relatively high surface brightness.


Sherburne Burnham discovered IC 4791 visually on 4 Jun 1889 with the 36-inch Lick refractor.  Burnham measured micrometric offsets from the nearby bright star (Lalande 35032 = HD 174262) in 1899 at Yerkes (Publ of Yerkes Obs, Vol 1, p296).


On the DSS, this object appears to be a fairly bright compact galaxy (confirmed by Brian Skiff on POSS 2), though it is not listed in any modern catalogue except for LEDA 1588608. The IC description "Neb;* 6 f 2’" should read "* 6 p 2’".

17.5" (7/20/98): this is a very close pair of mag 13.5 stars at the NE edge of NGC 6717 (Palomar 9) just 20" from the center.  Bigourdan recorded this object as a "Neb[ulous] *13, 15" nf NGC 6717".


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 4802 = Big. 434 on 30 Jun 1884 and described it in the 22 Jul 1901 Comptes Rendus as "nebulous star mag 13, situated near NGC 6717 in PA 35° [NE], d = 15"."  Harold Corwin comments, "It was found and measured on the same night that Bigourdan measured NGC 6717.  His position is precise and agrees to within a few arcsec of the GSC position.  This nails the object as a clump of stars about 15 arcsec northeast of the center of NGC 6717."

Sherburne Burnham discovered IC 4867 on 21 Jun 1901 at Yerkes Observatory while measuring the separation and position angle of nearby O∑ 182.  This galaxy was probably discovered earlier by Lewis Swift on 15 Apr 1890, but his position was 50' too far south.  In a letter to Herbert Howe, Swift corrected the declination 35' further north, but this still placed his position 15' south of IC 4867.  Still, Dreyer questioned if IC 4867 = IC 1301 in the IC, probably as Swift mentioned the nearby double star.

Max Wolf found IC 4895 on photographs taken at Heidelberg on 16 Jul 1906 and 8 Aug 1907.  He assumed the two brighter HII regions at the north end of Barnard's Galaxy were NGC 6822 and IC 1308 (the mistake originates by Ormond Stone at the Leander McCormick observatory) and thought the galaxy itself was a new discovery (AN 4207).

Once corrected, his position falls very close to Shapley-Ames 5 (New 5) = ESO 285-007.  In addition, his description fits using three or four stars close east.  Using the same correction for Sw.

Lewis Swift found IC 4948 = Sw. XII-16 on 17 Sep 1897.  There is nothing at his position.  Harold Corwin suggests that Lewis Swift made an 18 minute error in time in recording the RA of Sw.

But Swift lists the discovery date for IC 4948 as 17 Sep 1897, 6 nights later than IC 4946, though he also made a number of errors in recording dates during his last year of observing.  So, some uncertainly on this equivalence still remains.

The discovery was included in a final list of 6 new nebulae at the end of his notebook and mentioned in the "Seventeenth Annual Report of the Observatory", published in 1882.  Pietro Baracchi later reobserved the pair and made a diagram of the field.  Dreyer apparently wasn't aware of this announcement in the observatory report so IC 4970 wasn't assigned a NGC designation.


DeLisle Stewart rediscovered IC 4970 on a plate taken at Harvard's Arequipa station on 21 Sep 1900.  He noted "bM, nr NGC 6872."  Stewart is credited with the discovery in the IC.

30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 429x; faint to fairly faint, slightly elongated SW-NE, 20"x15".   A close (interacting) companion (LEDA 270900) off the south edge was not noticed.  Slightly fainter of a pair with IC 4985 2.3' NE.  Probable member of the Pavo-I Group.


Pietro Baracchi discovered IC 4982 on 3 Sep 1885 while searching for NGC 6872 and 6876 in the Pavo-I cluster with the 48" Melbourne Telescope.  Baracchi's sketch, which perfectly matches the field, displays IC 4982 and IC 4985 as small round nebulae along with a half dozen field stars.  The discovery was never published.


DeLisle Stewart independently discovered IC 4982 = D.S. 665 on a plate taken at Harvard's Arequipa station on 21 Sep 1900.  He noted "vF, bM."  Stewart was credited with the discovery in the IC.

V = 11.6;  Size 2.6'x1.8';  Surf Br = 13.1;  PA = 145°


18" (8/19/09): fairly faint, moderately large, oval 3:2 NW-SE, 1.5'x1.0'.  Broad concentration to a large, brighter core.  Located 8.5' S of mag 8.3 HD 192815.  Forms a pair with ESO 340-13 2.7' E (not seen at a low viewing elevation).  The identification of this galaxy with IC 4991 is possible, though unlikely.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 4991 = Sw. XI-191 on 23 Sep 1897 and reported, "vF; cS; R; no bright star near".  There is nothing near his position.  The nearest bright galaxy is ESO 340-011, identified as IC 4991 in the ESO-Uppsala catalogue (and followed by PGC, RC3, NED, NGC 2000.0 etc.).  This galaxy is located 32' north of Swift's position and 37 seconds of RA east.  But a mag 9.5 star is 5' NW as well as a mag 8.3 star less than 9' N, both of which would be noticeable in his 33' field.  Although Swift's positions are notoriously poor in his final observing years, the two nearby bright stars in makes this identification unlikely.  Still it is certainly bright enough to have been picked up by Swift, so it remains a possibility.

IC 4996 = OCl 158 = C 2014+374 = Cr 418

20 16 30 +37 38 00; Cyg

V = 7.3;  Size 6'


18" (8/14/04): beautiful open cluster at 225x with perhaps three dozen stars resolved in fairly poor seeing.  Appears small, but rich and quite elongated SSW-NNE, ~4'x2'.  Includes three bright mag 8.5-9.5 stars (ADS 13626) forming an obtuse isosceles triangle with the brightest star at the vertex.  A 4th fainter star to the west forms a trapezoid with this trio.  Two of the stars in the triangle are close, unequal doubles (including ß422, 9.7/10.8 at 4") and the single star has a 13th magnitude close pair nearby!  The remainder of the stars in the cluster are generally mag 13 and fainter.  There are sprays of stars to the north and south giving the elongated appearance.  Located 1.1° SE of the Crescent Nebula and 1.7° SW of M29.


13.1" (8/25/84): ~40 stars at 144x.  Rich in faint stars using averted vision.


13.1" (9/9/83): 30-40 stars at 160x, appears very rich, includes several very faint stars, elongated SSW-NNE.  The brightest stars are three mag 8.5-9 stars in a tight grouping in the center.


8" (8/28/81): consists of three mag 9 stars with a string of stars to the stars, over haze, appears rich with averted.


William Herschel discovered IC 4996 on 20 Sep 1786 (sweep 594) and recorded, "Clustering stars the place taken is pretty much condensed, and contains 3 pS stars close together".  He didn't assign an internal discovery number or H-designation, so this observation went unpublished, but Wolfgang Steinicke found that his offset in time and PD from 6th magnitude 34 Cygni (the next object in the sweep) matches this cluster.  Steinicke also notes that soon after in the sweep he encountered M29, and just noted a "Clustering large stars" again without assigning a number.


According to Steinicke, Hugo Clemens "noticed the object on a plate taken [13 Jun 1896] for the Photographische Himmelskarte with a 10.5" f/10.5 astrograph at Potsdam Observatory."  The IC credit went to Frank Bellamy, who independently discovered IC 4996 on a plate taken 13 Jun 1896 with the 13" astrograph at Radcliff Observatory in Oxford.  The discovery was announced in the paper "A New Cluster in Cygnus", MNRAS 64, 662 (1904).  Bellamy didn't state a position for the cluster and Dreyer's estimated position is ~25'  too far north.

V = 10.8;  Size 2"


17.5" (8/18/01): the PN appears as an unusually bright mag 11 "star" (V = 10.8) at 100x in a rich star field.  Verified with OIII blinking.  An excellent comparison star is a mag 10 star just 1' SW.  A 12th mag star 2' WSW completes a distinctive obtuse triangle.  With the filter the PN is nearly one magnitude brighter than the 10th mag star.  At 280x, the PN is bluish and a tiny disc was highly suspected, perhaps 2"-3".


13" (7/85): bright stellar planetary at all powers, confirmed with an OIII blinking from El Cerrito.  A slightly brighter mag 10.4 star for comparison blinking is 1.1' SW.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4997 = Fleming 97 in 1896 during an examination of stars with unusual spectra on a Harvard objective prism plate.  The discovery was reported by Pickering in the Harvard College Observatory, Circular No.9 in July 1896.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Gustav Gruss independently visually discovered IC 4997 around 1896, using a 6" or 8" refractor with the aid of a spectroscope, so both deserve discovery credit.


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported IC 4997 was "indistinguishable from a star on the Crossley negatives, but shown to have a minute disk visually with the 36-inch."
