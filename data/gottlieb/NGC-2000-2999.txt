V = 12.1;  Size 1.5'


30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): fairly bright, moderately large LMC cluster, slightly elongated, 50" diameter, very mottled, contains a brighter and denser core.  The halo is resolved into many mag 14.5-16 stars, particularly on the south and west side.  Located on the south end of the LMC, 25' SW of NGC 2025.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2000 = h2889 on 8 Feb 1836 and described as "F; R; vlbM; 60"."  His position (single sweep) is accurate.

V = 9.5;  Size 7.3'x3.6'


25" (10/10/15 - OzSky): a gorgeous, elongated star cloud/association (LH 64), extending 7'x2.5' NNE-SSW.  Roughly 65 stars, including a number of mag 12-13 stars are resolved in this region over a glowing background.  A mag 10.7 star is at the southwest end and a non-stellar mag 12 knot (KMHK 955) is north of center.  A curving chain of a dozen stars pokes out of the west side and heads south towards S-L 495 (3.4' W of the mag 10.7 star).  S-L 495 is a very bright, very small knot, 20" diameter.  It was difficult to resolve this clump, but a few stars popped.  A mag 12.5 star is just off the west edge.  LH 58, a stunning large star cloud and HII complex including NGCs 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1970, lies roughly 13' WSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2001 = h2888 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "the middle of the most condensed part of a cluster of stars 13th mag which runs off to the south-preceding and joins No. 39 of this sweep."  In a separate entry on the same sweep he also mentioned "Here commences a very starry or resolved region of the greater Nubecula."


James Dunlop possibly discovered this association earlier on 25 Sep 1826, recording D 178 as "a small faint nebula with a ray proceeding from it, about 6' or 7' long; a small star is involved in the preceding extremity of the ray."  Dunlop's position is 11' ENE of the cluster and Herschel noted the possible equivalence of D 178.  Glen Cozens equates NGC 2001 = D 136, which was recorded as "a faint confused pretty large nebula.  There are a multitude of small nebulae in this place."  The position is D 136 is ~12' SSW of the association and actually falls much closer to NGC 1983.  So, I don't see how a specific assignment can be made without additional information, such as similar offsets on the same night.

05 30 21.0 -66 53 02; Dor

V = 10.1;  Size 1.9'x1.7'


24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this cluster is extremely bright but small.  It is sharply concentrated with a small, brilliant core surrounded by a much fainter 30" halo.  At 346x, the core diameter is ~15" diameter and three interior stars are resolved, the brightest on the southeast side.  Sharing the same field 8' SE is the double cluster NGC 2006 and S-L 538.


NGC 2002 is at the west end of a huge, arcing string of associations (bowed to the south) referred to as LH 77 or the "Quadrant", which extends nearly 40' to the east beyond NGC 2041.  The Quadrant, itself, defines the southern rim of the huge LMC-4 Superbubble, a ring of HII regions and clusters spanning 6000 l.y.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2002 = D 214 on 24 Sep 1826 and recorded a "a round small nebula, 12" or 15" diameter."  He made two observations and his position is 4.7' SW of the cluster.  JH credited Dunlop with the discovery.


JH made two observations for h2890.  On 20 Dec 1835 he logged "place of a double star, the chief of a great cluster of small stars loose and filling the field. It is the forerunner of the great cluster-region [OB association LH 77] of the nubecula." On a second sweep he called it "vB, S, R. Here comes on the richest and brightest part of the starry and clustering portion of the nubecula. (Note - From this object being described at one time as a double star, and at another as a nebula, it is probable that it is one of those singular close-knotted groups which especially characterize the nubeculae)."  So, it appears he is describing two objects -- one the cluster (containing the double star) and second, the association that contains the cluster.

V = 11.3;  Size 2.1'


30" (10/12/15 - OzSky): at 303x; extremely bright, extremely high surface brightness core, fairly small, 30" diameter.  Surrounded by a thin fainter halo. A mag 13-13.5 star or quasi-stellar knot [BSDL 2043] is at the west end and a couple of mag 15 stars are off the east side.  Two mag 9 and 10 stars lie 4.7' SSW and 7' SSW and mag 8.0 HD 36849 is 9' WNW.


S-L 553 and the remarkable Eighth-Note Nebula (LHa 120-N55) lies ~8' E.  Even without a filter the Eighth Note Nebula is a gorgeous object with ~75 stars (S-L 553) in a 7'x3' region elongated NW-SE.  A very large, detailed nebula encompasses these stars.  There are four main sections with the largest and brightest on the southeast end (N55A) extending ~2.5' diameter in an uneven, knotty circular glow.  A couple of dozen stars are involved with N55A including a mag 13 star on the northeast end and a mag 12 star on its northeast side.  A second small, detached 35" glow lies ~2' NW.  Unfiltered, 4 or 5 mag 15-15.5 stars are involved.  A larger roundish glow, extending 1', is 2' further NNW.  A few mag 15 stars are involved and mag 11.5-12 HD 269722 (brightest in the cluster, type OBe) is 1.4' ENE.  Finally the 4th and faintest piece is a 50" detached glow that is close north of the bright star.  Three mag 14-14.5 stars are involved. Using an NPB filter at 152x enhances the nebulosity, presenting a showpiece object similar in detail to the Red DSS2 image!  The three southern nebulous glows all have an irregular surface brightness and are connected by very faint nebulosity but the northernmost section seems detached.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this compact cluster in the LMC appeared fairly faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  Appears to have a star involved or increases to a sharp stellar nucleus.  S-L 553, a 3' star cloud (association LH 72) lies 9' E.  S-L 553 appeared as a 3' elongated glow, consisting of a half-dozen resolved stars over an unresolved background glow of stars and nebulosity.  The outline is irregular but elongated N-S.  S-L 553 cluster is embedded within the HII complex LMC-N55 ("Eighth-Note Nebula"), though I didn't use a UHC filter to examine its extent.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2003 = h2891 on 23 Nov 1834 and described "a B S stellar neb, or very close cluster 15"."  His position is accurate.  GC and NGC misidentify (typo) this cluster with h2981, instead of h2891.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): bright, superb cluster, ~3' diameter.  Contains a small, brilliant core and a highly resolved halo that is packed with 50 stars.  The surrounding field is quite rich in both faint and brighter mag 11-12 stars.  The NGC 1955/1968/1974 complex lies ~20' SW and the NGC 2014/2020 complex lies 27' SSE.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2004 = D 215 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a round well-defined nebula, about 20" diameter, bright at the centre."  Dunlop reported 3 observations and his position is 5.5' WSW of center (relatively accurate for him).


John Herschel observed this bright cluster (h2893) on 6 sweeps: on 2 Nov 1834 he recorded "B; pretty rich; compressed cluster of stars 12m."  Next he recorded "globular, B; irreg; R; 2'.  The stars are easily distinguishable."  On a third sweep he wrote "globular, B; S; R; comp M to a blaze of stars.  Many stragglers."  His position is accurate.

30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): extremely bright, fairly large, round, 45" diameter, very bright core, mottled halo, high surface brightness.  No resolution except for a couple of extremely faint star around the periphery.  Located 2' NE of mag 9.1 HD 37121 along the southeast side of the LMC's central bar.  NGC 2005 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.


I noticed two nearby faint clusters.  H-S 332, just 2.3' S and 50" SE of the mag 9 star, is a faint 20" glow with no resolution.  S-L 514 was also picked 3.3' SW.  It appeared  fairly faint, elongated WSW-ENE, 40"x25", grainy but no resolution.  A mag 13 star is off the southwest edge.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2005 = D 138? on 24 Sep 1826 and described a "small round faint nebula."  His position is 12.7' ESE of the cluster.  JH independently discovered the cluster with a 5-inch refractor between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 and listed it as #509 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."

05 31 20.0 -66 58 23; Dor

V = 10.9;  Size 1.6'x1.4'


24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): forms the southern member of a close pair of small clusters (a genuine binary cluster pair!) with SL-538 less than 1' N.  At 346x it appeared fairly bright, fairly small, ~30" diameter, brighter core, with no evident resolution.  Forms a small triangle with two stars on the east side.  Located 8' SE of NGC 2002.   NGC 2006 is near the northwestern side of the huge OB association LH 77, an arcing group of clusters and stars stretching 40' E-W and including NGC 2002, 2027 and 2041 and collectively dubbed the "Quadrant Arc".


Just 0.9' N is S-L 538, a small, moderately bright glow that is sandwiched between a brighter star at the east edge and a fainter star off the west side.  At 346x the shape appeared irregular and ~25" diameter.  Interestingly, John Herschel's two positions for NGC 2006 on different sweeps correspond closely with each cluster, so he apparently viewed both (they are quite similar in the eyepiece) and NGC 2006 should apply to the pair.  Herschel didn't note this object as double, though he commented this object was the central part of the "extremely rich assemblage of stars and clustering groups which fill the field."


John Herschel discovered NGC 2006 = h2895 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "a very small nucleus knot in an extremely rich assemblage of stars and clustering groups which fill the field."  On his second sweep JH recorded "a small highly condensed knot in an immensely large and very rich cluster, which fills much more than the field, and is like the Milky Way."  His positions differ by ~2' in declination and apply to two different close clusters!  NGC 2006 is generally assigned to the southern object, with the northern cluster is S-L 538.  The "immensely large and very rich cluster, which fills much more than the field, and is like the Milky Way" is known as the "Quadrant Arc".

25" (4/3/19 - OzSky): at 244x; bright, large, elongated N-S, 1.5' diameter, brighter elongated core N-S, mottled and clumpy with a few 16th mag stars popping in/out of visibility.  Located 1.5' NE of mag 8.9 HD 37181.


S-L 566, located 11' ENE, appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 35" diameter, small bright core, no resolution.

S-L 539, located 8' NNE, appeared moderately bright, fairly small, irregular.  Unusual appearance as several stars are involved including a bright mag 12 star with a close companion is on the east side, another faint double star is resolved with a third double at the west edge.  A mag 14 star and fainter companion is off the south side.

LMC-SMP 73 is just 2.3' NE of S-L 539.  This is the first PN (stellar) in the LMC I've observed!  It was visible unfiltered as a mag 14.7 "star" forming the south vertex of a small isosceles triangle with a mag 14.4 star 0.6' NW and a mag 14.1 star 0.9' N.  Easy to verify as there was a very good contrast gain when I added a NPB filter.  Only the brighter star to the north as still faint visible with the filter but the PN appeared much brighter.


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is located just 1.5' NE of 9th magnitude HD 37181.  This star is part of a large, scattered group of mag 8.5-10.5 stars including a prominent 24' loop with a double star (h3783 = 8.2/10.7 at 15") at the east end of the loop.  This double star is 6' S of NGC 2010.  NGC 2031 lies 18' SE and the bright HII complex/cluster NGC 2018 lies 15' S.

A group ~3' NW of the brighter star is a quartet containing two mag 10.5 stars, while 6' NW is a evenly distributed quintet of mag 11-12 stars.  Also, a couple of arcminutes further NW are 3 stars including a double.  The three small groupings are extended NW to SE and span 7', although John Herschel's description may just apply to the first two groups which are 4' diameter.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2013 = h364 on 10 Feb 1831 (sweep 324) and described "a poor cl of 8 or 10 stars 11 mag."   The NGC RA is 30 tsec larger than JH's discovery position and corresponds better with the center of this group of stars.

A mag 10 star (brightest in the cluster) is at the south end of this string.  A portion of the cluster is immersed in nebulosity (Henize N57A), most prominently on the southeast side of the cluster.  Irregular haze (roughly elongated SW-NE) extends out of the cluster for a couple of arc minutes on the east side, spreading south and north (part of a Superbubble).  NGC 2014 forms an interesting contrast with emission nebula NGC 2020 5' ESE.  The remarkable Seagull Nebula (NGC 2030, 2032, 2035) lies ~20' NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2014 = h2900 on 23 Dec 1834 and described the "chief *9 of a very irreg cluster, 4' long, 3' broad."  On a second sweep he logged "a pretty L irreg cluster 7th class; chief *9m taken (at leaving the field); the rest are 10...15m."  His position is accurate.


James Dunlop possibly discovered this cluster (D 217?) earlier on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta, NSW, and recorded "a rather well-defined nebula, 40" or 50" diameter.  Dunlop observed this object 3 times and his position is 5' SSW of the cluster.  Despite Dunlop's relatively good position, JH did not credit Dunlop with the discovery and Dunlop's description for D 217 implies a much smaller object, so I'm also hesitant about this identification.

Near the east end is open cluster S-L 557, which is often taken for NGC 2015.  It appeared fairly bright, fairly small, very irregular outline, 35" diameter.  It contains a brighter mag 13.5 star and at least a half-dozen mag 14.5-16 stars over haze.  Mag 9.7 HD 269720 lies 2.3' NE.  Extending west and spreading north and south is a large star cloud (association LH 74) containing a number of mag 12 stars and at least 70 in total.  The background glow of unresolved stars is bright in this entire region.  NGC 2009 is 7' NW of S-L 557.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2015 = h2901 on 24 Nov 1834 and reported "the general middle of a cluster of loose stars 11...16m.  It is rich and fills the whole field."  The "whole field" contains the smaller cluster S-L 557 on its east side, which Shapley-Lindsay and the Hodge-Wright Atlas took as NGC 2015.  But based on Herschel's description Brent Archinal says "This is not NGC 2015" in "Star Clusters".

John Herschel discovered NGC 2017 = h2896 on 11 Dec 1835 and recorded a "fine clustering group of large stars."  His position matches the multiple star h3780.  Bica et al, in 2001A&A...366..827B, call this object a "possible Open Cluster remnant".

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a fascinating, showpiece HII complex (N206) with a cluster (S-L 533) and a large, detailed nebula (N206) appearing like a fainter version of M8 -- of course, in another galaxy!  At 200x the cluster is ~8' in diameter and includes a couple of dozen mag 11-15 stars (part of the stellar association LH 69).  The stars are involved in the glow of a bright HII complex (LMC-N206) that has an excellent response to a UHC filter.


The brightest region of nebulosity (N206A) is a very prominent 1' circular patch on the east end of the cluster.  Fainter wings extend north and south, increasing the size to 3'x1' N-S.  A wide pair of stars including mag 11.5 HDE 269676 [a massive, compact cluster containing several O-type stars]  is at the west edge of this patch.  Three additional elongated patches (each 1' to 1.5' in diameter) along the SW side of the complex are strung out in a 6' line oriented NW to SE; BSDL 2005 (7' W of NGC 2018), BSDL 2048 (5' WSW) and N206B = BSDL 2120 (5' SW).  Another glowing patch of nebulosity (BSDL 2108), ~45" diameter, is ~3' W of N206A and surrounds a couple of brighter stars.  Finally, an isolated, elongated patch is on the northwest end of the complex (BSDL 1985, associated with mag 13.0 HD 37248, a WC4+O9 Wolf-Rayet binary) that seems detached.  Weaker sections of the nebulosity give the impression of dark lanes.  The entire complex forms a superbubble extending ~12' E-W and ~9' N-S.  Surprisingly, Herschel's description applies only to the brightest region at the east end of this entire complex.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2018 = h2904 on 3 Nov 1834 and recorded "pB; R; pglbM; 2'; a star 10m involved, preceding."  His position (single sweep) is on the southeast side of the brightest portion of the nebula.  The ESO position is centered on the entire complex described in my notes and not the bright piece described by Herschel.

V = 10.9;  Size 1.5'


30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): at 394x; extremely bright, large, 50" diameter, sharply concentrated with a large intense core and smooth halo, no resolution.  NGC 2019 is one of 15 bona-fide ancient GC's in the LMC.


S-L 542 (brightest of 3 nearby clusters) is 4.6' SW, BSDL 2196 is 2.7' SW and S-L 544 is 5' NNW.  S-L 542 is fairly bright, moderately large, round, 40" diameter, mottled but with no definite resolution.  A mag 12.8 star is 0.9' NW.  BSDL 2196 (noticed between NGC 2019 and S-L 542) is a very faint, small, round, low surface brightness patch, 20" diameter, no resolution.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2019 = h2905 on 11 Nov 1836 and recorded the cluster as "B; R; gbM; 60".  He observed it on two sweeps and his position is just off the east side.  On the first observation, though, his polar distance was 1° further north, but he rejected that (correctly) in favor of the polar distance in the second sweep.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 2019 = D 96, D 98, D 99 and/or D 94 (one or more of these may apply!) on 24 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta.  He described D 96 as "a faint round nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, slightly bright to the centre."  Dunlop made two observations of D 96 and his position is 12' NW of this cluster.  But his position is also 12.6' SE of NGC 1986, so this description could also apply to the later cluster.  D 98, described as "a pretty well-defined round nebula, about 30" diameter" was observed twice and the position is just 1.9' W.  Finally, D 94, described as an "extremely faint small nebula" is also within Dunlop's usual errors (7' S of the cluster).    To further confuse the issue, Glen Cozens identifies NGC 2019 = D 99, which Dunlop described as a "pretty well-defined nebula, 20" diameter."  His position in this case is 16' SE of the cluster!

25" (4/5/19 - OzSky): at 244x and NPB filter; bright, large, roundish, annular with an easy out-of-round hole.  The WR star, Brey 48, was easily visible at 13th magnitude inside the ring, though slightly offset N of center .  The rim appeared brighter along the NW side, which seemed a bit flattened, and somewhat irregular in surface brightness, in general.  Unfiltered, a second fainter star (mag 15.8) was visible at the inner edge of the ring on the SE side.


30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): fairly bright, roundish, annular W-R bubble, slightly elongated SW-NE, 3'x2.5'.  The inner edge of the annulus is slightly brighter and sharply defined with a relatively large dark center, ~45" x 30".  North of center in the ring is the 13th magnitude Wolf-Rayet star HD 269748 = Brey 48, which appears roughly centered in the emission nebula.  A 12th magnitude star lies 1.3' S of the central star, at the southern edge of the nebula.  Two fainter stars are just north and south of the mag 12 star and this trio is collinear with the central star.  NGC 2020 forms a striking due with NGC 2014 (cluster and emission nebula) 5' WNW.  The remarkable Seagull Nebula (NGC 2030, 2032, 2035) lies 15' NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2020 = h2903 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "pB; vL; vglbM; lE; 4'.  A fine cluster [NGC 2014] precedes it."  On the very next sweep he wrote "vF; vL; R; vglbM; 4' diameter."  His position is accurate.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 2020 = D 218? earlier in 1826 and described "a pretty bright round nebula, 30" diameter, with a minute star slightly involved in the margin."  Dunlop claims two observations and his position is 5' too far NE, well within his usual errors.  But this nebula is probably too faint to have been picked up by Dunlop with his 9" reflector and his description could apply to NGC 2014, which is 9' west of his position.   Wolfgang Steinicke attributes Herschel with the discovery and I agree.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): bright, compact knot surrounding two resolved stars, slightly elongated, ~20"x15".  This knot is in the northern end of a very large, elongated cluster or star cloud.  Extending mostly south of NGC 2021 is a very elongated stream of stars, 5'x1', including a mix of brighter and fainter stars (stellar association LH 78).  The densest concentration is a 2' group (S-L 567) on the south end with a number of mag 12-14 stars.  Roughly a total of 50-60 stars were resolved.  The Seagull Nebula complex (NGC 2030, 2032, 2035) lies 12' SE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2021 = h2906 on 31 Jan 1835 and logged "vS; F; R; 12".  In the northern part of a cluster of stars 14m, 8' long, 3' br."  His position points to the small clluster S-L 567 within the stellar association LH 79.

48" (2/21/12): at 488x, this bright, double-shell planetary contains a bright oval ring oriented SSW-NNE, ~23"x18".  The annulus is fairly thin with a relatively large, darker central hole, though the contrast is fairly low.  At the exact center is a faint central star (close to 16th mag?).  The ring has an irregular surface brightness; slightly brighter at the ends of the major axis, particularly the SW end (knot or thicker?), and slightly fainter along the minor axis.  Surrounding the ring is a fainter and rounder outer shell, ~30" diameter.  The outer shell was surprisingly prominent and exhibited a pinkish hue.


24" (1/25/14): at 500x appeared as a fairly bright knotty annulus, slightly elongated SW-NE with fascinating structure.  The rim was clearly brighter along an ~200° arc running from the southwest counterclockwise to the northeast.  Very small brighter knots were definite at the SW and NE ends and perhaps a slight brightening at the NW edge.  In general, though, the rim appeared mottled and sparkling though clearly dimmer along the southeast side, giving a "C" appearance.  At 750x, the darker center was also irregular in surface brightness and occasionally, an extremely faint central star sparkled.


18" (2/24/06): at 220x appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, ~25" diameter, very slightly elongated, irregularly lit and brighter along the western half of the rim giving a "C" appearance.  A faint sparkle is occasionally visible on the WSW edge of the rim and images show this may be a faint superimposed star or knot in the planetary.  320x provides an excellent view with the planetary weakly annular and the rim a bit dimmer on the SE side.  At 435x, the shape is slightly elongated SW to NE, ~27"x22" with a mottled interior and a brighter rim, particularly along the western half.  The appearance is quite patchy at 565x and the sparkle on the SW end is still evident.  The central star was not seen at any power.  Ced 59 (surrounding FU Orionis) lies 48' due east.


17.5" (2/2/02): immediately picked up at 100x as a very small, bluish-gray "egg" of fairly high surface brightness.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  At 380x (unfiltered), it appeared as fairly bright, clearly elongated SSW-NNE, ~27"x20".  The surface brightness was irregular or mottled with a slightly brighter rim and darker center giving a weakly annular appearance.  The rim seems to have a couple of slightly brighter spots and the ends of the minor axis are slightly dimmer.  No sign of a central star.


17.5" (12/8/90): fairly bright, slightly elongated 4:3 ~SSW-NNE, about 30" diameter.  Appears slightly annular at 412x with a brighter rim.  No central star seen at this power.


13": moderately bright, high surface brightness.  No internal structure was visible.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2022 = H IV-34 = h365 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 496) and described it as "cB, vS, like a star with a large diameter.  With 240 it appeared almost like a planetary nebula, but very ill defined, and little elongated.  Nearly of equal brightness throughout, except at the edges."  John Herschel wrote (sweep 121, 19 Jan 1828), "Planetary neb, a little indistinct at the edges; rather oval and perhaps of a mottled light."


NGC 2022 was observed 5 times with Lord Rosse's 72", often in an attempt to resolve it, and the following notes were recorded:

11 Dec 1850: "It is I am nearly sure resolvable, probably it is a glob Cl.  At times I fancied the centre a little darker and a star in the p part."

23 Oct 1851: "I strongly suspect annular, r[esolvable], one star especially seen in the p part.

28 Dec 1853:  "...a B patch or a star?, it is near the edge of the neb.  Some dark spot or spots certainly seen and at times I had the suspicion of a concentric ring or rings."

5 Jan 1877: "Seems a glob Cl, stars seen sparkling in it, oval sp nf.  Edges v diffuse, especially sf, np edge more sharp.  Proportion of diameters about 7:10."


William Lassell observed NGC 2022 in Jan. 1853 from Malta with his 24-inch equatorial reflector and commented, "a singular curdled-looking object, slightly and irregularly elliptical, with a sort of cordon [outer shell] running round parallel, but a little outside of its margin."  A sketch was included in his 1854 MRAS paper (figure 2).  Father Secchi sketched a slightly darker center in his 1856 "Osservazioni di Nebulose".  In 1862 and 1863, Lassell aos observed the planetary through his 48-inch on Malta and noted "with 1060x some brighter patches or nodules seem to exist in it, but nothing more can be made out.”  His sketch showed the central star and a thin outer ring separated by a thin dark gap.


Based on a Crossley photograph, Curtis (1918) reported, "Sharp stellar nucleus about mag 13, surrounded by an elliptical ring 22"x17" in outside dimensions in pa 29°.  Outside this is an oval disk of fainter matter 28"x27".  The brightest parts are the two masses at the ends of the major axis of the inner ring."

The reflection nebula has a fairly well defined border on the west side.  A superimposed mag 12.5 star is 2.4' ESE and there is a bite or divot into the nebulosity around this star.  Very low surface brightness glow, though, is evident extending further SE and E of this star.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2023 = H IV-24 on 6 Jan 1785 (sweep 352) and described in his 1791 paper "On Nebulous Stars" as "A bright star with a very considerably milky chevelure; a little extended, 4 or 5' in length, and near 4' broad; it loses itself insensibly. I suspected some extensive milky windings in the neighborhood but could not verify them; other stars of equal magnitude are perfectly free from this chevelure."  He later noted "The connection between the star and the chevelure cannot be doubted, from the insensible gradation of its luminous appearance, decreasing as it receded from the centre."

Excellent structure with ragged edges, gaps, streaks, rifts and various brightness levels.  The eastern strip has one or two indentations or a scalloped inner edge.  The inner edge of the connecting strip has a sharply defined edge and the gap at the base connecting the brighter western section is obvious.  Zeta Orionis lies 15' NE detracts and the best view is unfiltered.

8" (10/4/80): fairly bright, large.  Consists of two parallel strips separated by a dark lane. Appears possibly broken (gap) at the base of "U".  Best view with a UHC filter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2024 = H V-28 on 1 Jan 1786 (sweep 506) and recorded "a wonderful milky nebulosity, divided into 3 or 4 large patches including a dark space, the whole cannot take up less than half a degree; but I suppose it to be much more extensive."  A month later (sweep 518) he noted "Wonderful black space inlcuded in nebulosities."


The following information is from Wolfgang Steinicke's book "Observing Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters.  NGC 2024 was independently found by Brorsen in 1850 with a small refractor at Senftenberg Observatory and announced in AN that "I have found a very faint, very extended, pretty irregular nebula, located about 15 minutes east of Zeta Orionis, which is listed neither in the catalogue of the younger Herschel nor in Messier's."  In 1856 Marth noted that Brorsen's object was William Herschel's H. V-28.  This was another case where the observer only checked the Slough catalogue and didn't refer to WH's catalogues, which only had relative offsets and not absolute positions.


Heinrich d'Arrest sketched the nebula in 4 sections. The brightest section (labeled A) is just west of the main dust lane.  This object was observed 13 times at Birr Castle from 1873-1878 by Lawrence Parsons (with the 36-inch), Ralph Copeland and Dreyer, and stars "in an about the neb" were sketched and accurately measured.


Garrett Serviss (Pleasures of the Telescope, 1901) wrote "Just to the left of Zeta, and in the same field of view with a very low power, is a remarkable nebula bearing the catalogue number GC 1227. We must use our five-inch on this with a low power, but with Zeta out of the field in order to avoid its glare. The nebula is exceedingly faint, and we can be satisfied if we see it simply as a hazy spot, although with much larger telescopes it has appeared at least half a degree broad. Tempel saw several centers of condensation in it, and traced three or four broad nebulous streams, one of which decidedly suggested spiral motion."

The group lacks any concentration and appears to be an asterism with the three brighter stars drawing attention to the group.  However, there is a small arc of a half a dozen mag 13 stars that includes SAO 77448 at the SE corner and a nice clump of mag 13 stars is just south of the mag 9.5 star at the north end of the group. Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2026 = H VIII-28 on 5 Dec 1784 (sweep 329) and reported "a cluster of pretty large scattered stars. Not rich."  No observations were made by JH or at Birr Castle.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, found "no distinct Cl" and RNGC classifies it as nonexistent (Type 7" with the comment "No cluster".

V = 11.0;  Size 1.0'


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): NGC 2027 is at the west end of an interesting, elongated cluster or association (LH 84) extending ~4'x2' E-W in a crescent shape with NGC 2034 at the east end.  At 105x, this condensed portion of the cloud contains a couple of dozen mag 12-13 stars and a wide pair of mag 10 stars on the NW side.  Although NGC 2027 is often applied to the small cluster S-L 592, Herschel described the entire association LH 84.


NGC 2027 is situated ~10' NW of the compact cluster NGC 2041 and near the east end of a huge, elongated star cloud known as the "Quadrant" (consisting of OB associations LH 65, LH 77 and LH 84) looping SW and the bending NW, extending 35' to NGC 2006 and 2002.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2027 = D 241 = h2908 on 6 Nov 1826 and described "a large cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes in strong nebula; irregular extended figure."  His position falls at the east end of association LH 77 or the west end of LH 84, known as the LMC "Quadrant" (of a circle).


JH made three observations of the field.  On the first sweep (2 Nov 1832) he described "a very large, very rich cluster of separate stars 9..11th mag, which fills the whole field." On a second sweep he called it "cluster 7th class. The second of two stars 9th mag, which may be considered the leading stars of the very large and fine cluster of the Nubecula Major, which fills many fields, is of all degrees of condensation, and much broken up into groups and patches." His third observation was recorded as "an ill-defined nebuloid group of stars 15th mag (N.B. Clouds very troublesome.) The field full of grouping stars."


Herschel is clearly describing the large OB association LH 77, which stretches west to NGC 2002.  His position from the second sweep ("second of two stars 9th magnitude") and third sweeps is close to S-L 592, and the position given here.  This cluster is also at the west end of a looping association of stars (probably NGC 2027) on the east end of LH 77.

30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): fairly bright, moderately large, roundish, high surface brightness, mottled, a couple of stars resolved at the edges.  A small partially resolved clump is just off the northeast side.  In a small trio with similar S-L 574 2.4' W and fainter H-S 353 2.2' NNW.  NGC 2028 is within association LH 80, a stunningly rich region of the LMC with NGC 2016 11' W, S-L 591 6' NE, H-S 362 is 8' NE, NGC 2036 8' SE and more.  A group of 4 mag 14 stars is 2' E.


S-L 574 appeared bright, moderately large, slightly elongated E-W, 30" diameter, brighter along the major axis, clumpy.  A mag 14 star is at the west tip and a mag 11.9 star is 0.9' SSW.  H-S 353 is a fairly faint, soft round glow, 30" diameter.  S-L 591 appeared fairly bright, fairly small, roundish, 35", mottled.  Only a couple of mag 16 stars resolved around the edges.  A mag 11.8 star is 1.7' NE.  H-S 362, just 2' ENE of S-L 591 is fairly faint, elongated NW-SE, 25" diameter.  It forms the eastern vertex of a equilateral triangle with S-L 591 and the mag 11.8 star.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2028 = h2912 on 12 Nov 1836 and simply noted as "vF".  His position is an excellent match (he corrected his RA by 10 sec) with cluster S-L 575, so the identification is certain although I'm surprised he apparently missed nearby S-L 574, which is equally as prominent.  JH questioned if his object might be D 100.  Dunlop's description reads "a small round nebula, about 2' north of a small star."  His position is just 2' NW of S-L 575 and 3.4' NE of a mag 11 star (his small star?).  But D 100 is also 10' ENE of NGC 2016, so it could be also be D 100 given his range of positional errors.  Neither Steinicke nor Glen Cozens equates D 100 with NGC 2028.

V = 12.3;  Size 4'


30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x, 264x and 429x; large, fairly bright cluster (S-L 595) with ~30 stars resolved in a 3.5' region and includes at least 4 brighter stars from mag 12.3-13.5 and another mag 12.7 star is at the SW edge.  Moderately faint nebulous haze (N63) encompasses the cluster.  Adding a NPB filter at 264x increases the contrast with the large nebulous glow, which extended 2.5-3' diameter.  Note: this object is identified as NGC 2030 in most sources!


N63A, embedded slightly east of center of N63, is a well-known bright, compact supernova remnant and one of the first 3 extragalactic SNRs to be discovered (1966).  The SNR appeared as a small round knot, only ~12"-15" in diameter, and was faintly visible even at 202x.  It was easy to distinguish at 264x and stood out fairly prominently at 429x.  Surprisingly, I didn't notice any contrast gain adding a NPB filter (similar visibility).


14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x): fairly bright, large, over a dozen mag 13 and fainter stars are resolved in a 3.5' region.  A fairly faint, oval emission glow (LMC-N63) is involved with the cluster (S-L 595).  Adding an NPB filter, the nebulosity is bright, large, irregular (roughly round), ~2.5' diameter, with several of the brighter stars still visible.


Emission nebula LHa 120-N 62A is 14' SSW.  Using an NPB filter, it appeared very bright, very elongated ~E-W, relatively large, ~1.5'x0.4'.  The shape is a bit irregular, but it has a sharply defined northern edge, with the southern edge weaker and more ill-defined.  Visible unfiltered but excellent response to the NPB.  A couple of very faint stars are visible with averted.  BSDL 2348, an LMC cluster perhaps associated with the nebula, is ~2' W and contains a  half-dozen mag 14-15 stars in a 1.5' knot, along with a mag 12.5 star on the west end.    Emission nebula LHa 120-N 64 is 16' further southeast.


Emission nebula LHa 120-N 64 is 20' SSE.  Using an NPB filter, it is a bright, large, irregular nebulous patch, about 3'x2' E-W.  The brightest portion (N64A) is on the west side.  A mag 11 star is ~2' N of the east end.  Another 2' NNW of this star is a detached 40" piece (N64C) that was fairly easy with the filter.  Unfiltered three mag 13 line in a 1.8' string are involved in the central portion, along with a couple of mag 14-15 stars.  Mag 8.8 HD 37853 is 6' NW.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, fairly large, 3'x1.5', elongated N-S.  This LMC object appears to be a large cluster with nebulosity (stellar association LH 83).  A half-dozen mag 12-13 stars are resolved over an irregular background haze (unresolved stars?).  Located 32' N of mag 6.2 HD 37935.  NGC 2003 lies 38' SW.  The compact SNR N63A is embedded (not noted).


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2029 = D 240 = h2911 on 27 Sep 1826 and noted a "faint round nebula, 25" or 30" diameter."  His position is just 4' SW of center of the nebula.  JH called this object "a rich, R, pL cluster of stars 12m; little comp; 5' l; one * 11m."  On a second sweep he wrote "pB; R; gbM; 60"; resolved into stars 13...15m."


Jenni Kay notes that GC and NGC positions for NGC 2029 and NGC 2030 are reversed from JH's original CGH positions of h2911 and h2910, respectively.  The error must have occurred when JH transfered his positions into the GC.  So, NGC 2030 = h2030 is part of the Seagull Nebula and NGC 2029 = h2911 is an isolated nebula. All modern sources such as SIMBAD, ESO and the KMHK catalogue reverse the original identifications and call NGC 2029 part of the Seagull Nebula.  See WSQJ #108, 4/97.  The identifications given here are based on the CGH positions/identifications.

Size 1.6'x0.9'


30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x and 264x + NPB filter; this is the first section in the remarkable Seagull or "Dragon's Head" Nebula, though the faintest of three connected patches extending 5.5' from NW to SE with NGC 2032 and 2036.  The brightest portion is an elongated "bar" section ~2'x40", oriented WSW-ENE, just west of mag 12.2 HD 269810.  Fainter nebulosity spreads to the north in roughly an oval outline and includes a mag 14.5 star, so the total extent of NGC 2030 in the N-S direction is over 2.5'.  Very faint nebulosity appears to connect NGC 2030 with brighter NGC 2032 directly SE.


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the NW component of the Seagull Nebula; a bright, highly structured 7'x5' emission nebula.  The brightest portion of NGC 2030 is a bright streak elongated E-W that extends west from mag 12.3 HD 269810.  A large mass of nebulosity spreads to the north from this streak in a more circular 2' patch.  This object is incorrectly identified as NGC 2029 in modern catalogues and atlases.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2030 = h2910 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "B; L; gbM.  The first of 3 neb, which run together."  On a second sweep, he logged "vF; pL; irreg R.  The first of 3, which run together.  See Plate III. fig 5."  The modern identities for NGC 2029 and 2030 are reversal.  See historical notes for NGC 2029.

V = 10.8;  Size 3.4'


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this LMC cluster was very bright, fairly large, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, well concentrated with a 1' core and 2' much fainter halo.  The cluster had a mottled texture and was quite lively around the edges, but was not clearly resolved.  Located 12' NW of mag 7.6 HD 37899 and 5.5' SW of a mag 9.1 star.  NGC 2018, a remarkable nebulous cluster, lies 12' WSW and NGC 2051 is a similar distance to the ESE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2031 = h2915 on 3 Nov 1834 and noted "F (?); R; gbM; 3' (Hazy Sky)".  On a later sweep he had a better view and logged "globular, B; R; gbM; 2'.  Resolved into stars."  His position is just off the south side of this large cluster.

Size 2'x1'


30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x and 264x + NPB filter; NGC 2032 and 2035, separated by a dark lane, form a stunning pair of adjacent emission nebulae of comparable surface brightness, though NGC 2032 is larger.  Using a narrow-band filter, NGC 2032 was extremely bright, elongated SW-NE, ~2'x1', with a scalloped but sharply defined border at the brighter edge along the dust lane. A fairly prominent thin filament extends NE for ~1.5', curling a bit towards the tip.  A thin strip on the SE end (just beyond the lane) connects to NGC 2035.  The ionizing star was visible unfiltered at the eastern border, in an indentation, though it appeared fainter than the listed mag of 13.5.  A second mag 14 star was also involved at 25" to its east.  A mag 11.4 star is off the SW side and a mag 12.2 star (O3-type HD 269810) is at the NE edge.  The latter star (also known as RMC 122) may be the ionizing source for the surrounding nebulosity.  NGC 2040 (part of same complex) is ~5' E.


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is possibly the brightest section of the "Seagull Nebula" or "Dragon's Head Nebula" in the LMC (similar to NGC 2035 1.6' SE).  It consists of a very bright, elongated ~SSW-NNE patch, 2'x1', with an unusual kidney-bean shape that is indented or concave on the east side.  NGC 2032 is just separated to 2035 by an elongated dark lane (oriented SSW-NNE) on the east side.  A faint, thin streamer of nebulosity shoots to the north from 2032.  Mag 11.4 HD 269808 is off the SW side.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2032 = D 219 on 27 Sep 1826 and described a "pretty bright round nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, bright towards the centre."  He states 2 observations were made and his published position is within the Seagull Nebula complex.  As NGC 2032 is probably the brightest section along with NGC 2035, this identification seems reasonable.  Herschel gave an uncertain equivalence with D 219 in his CGH catalogue.  He first observed the nebula (h2913) on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded "vB; vL.  A singular figure like 3 nebulae lumped together."  On a second sweep he recorded "pB; irreg fig; glbM."  On his next observation he logged "B; L; gbM.  The second of 3 which run together."  A detailed sketch of the complex was published in plate III, figure 5 in the CGH observations.


The Seagull Nebula contains four separate NGC designations: NGC 2030 (misidentified as NGC 2029 in GC and NGC), NGC 2032, NGC 2035 and NGC 2040 with NGC 2035 being the brightest and largest of the group.  Collectively the area is known as N59A and is located at the boundary of the supershell LMC4 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. NGC 2032 and 2035, which form the bright core of the H II region N59A (B053530- 6736), belong to a single H II region that appears divided due to the presence of a heavy dust lane.

Size 10'


14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 230x): large bright star cloud (stellar association LH 81), ~10' diameter with ~50 stars (depending on size taken) mag 11-14.


Adding an NPB filter brings out the associated nebulosity (LHA 120-N54), which is fairly bright and very large.  A curving swath of nebulosity, elongated E-W for ~8' is on the southwest side of the association.  The cluster itself is also encased in diffuse nebulosity with the filter.  NGC 2037 is generally taken as a small knot (BCDSP 8) within this star cloud.  NGC 2048, a bright emission nebula, is at the NE end of the association and together with NGC 2033 form part of a Superbubble.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2033 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and recorded it as #579 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  Herschel's position falls in the large stellar association LH 81.  But as there is no listing or description in the CGH catalogue, it's possible Herschel was recording a small knot or a very large field of stars + nebulosity.  So, the size and center is unknown.  See NGC 2037 for more.  The large nebulosity on the south side of the association might be NGC 2052.  See that number.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 2033 = D 141? earlier on 24 Sep 1826, recording "a faint extended nebula, about 4' long, very faint towards the extremities, brightest and broadest in the middle.  This is in the south following side of a faint cluster of very minute stars."  Dunlop's position (single observation) is 11' SE of this nebulous cluster.

V = 9.3;  Size 8'x4'


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this is an interesting, elongated curving cluster or association (LH 84), situated northwest of the compact cluster NGC 2041.  This condensed portion of LH 84 contains a couple of dozen mag 12-13 stars and a wide pair of mag 10 stars (including HD 269855) on the north side.  The resolved stars are embedded in an unresolved glow of fainter stars, ~4'x2', extended E-W in a crescent shape, arching north on both ends.  NGC 2034 is located at the east end of an impressive star cloud (collectively known as the "Quadrant" = LH 77), looping 30' W (bending south in the middle) to NGC 2002.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2034 = h2914 on 3 Jan 1837 and described "a more condensed part of the great cluster (sweep 761, 39), of a crescent-like form, occupying one field. Rich and fine."  His position corresponds with association LH 84 at the northeast end of the "Quadrant" feature of the LMC.  NGC 2034 = h2914 and NGC 2027 = h2908 both described the same field, though NGC 2027 is on the west end of the association.   Harold Corwin considers NGC 2027 to refer to the entire region.


James Dunlop discovered the association on 6 Nov 1826 and described D 241 as "a large cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes in strong nebula; irregular extended figure."  His position falls at the east end association LH 77 or the west end of LH 84, known as the LMC "Quadrant" (of a circle).

30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x and 264x + NPB filter; NGC 2032 and 2035, separated by a dark lane, form a stunning pair of adjacent emission nebulae of comparable surface brightness, though NGC 2032 is larger.  The two impressive regions are attached or merge at the south end by a thin strip of nebulosity.  NGC 2035 was extremely bright, roughly rectangular but irregular with slightly concave eastern side and lots of complex, internal structure with brighter and darker areas. A fairly thin streamer is attached on the northeast end and extends 2' NNE, similar (though slightly fainter) to a filament attached to NGC 2032!  LMC-N59C is a detached patch ~2' SE.  It appeared moderately large, roundish, at least 1' diameter.  A mag 10.4 star is 2' ESE.


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the southeast section of the bright Seagull Nebula in the LMC.  At 200x using a UHC filter it appeared very bright, moderately large, with a very irregular shape similar to an anvil.  The very knotty, complex structure was elongated N-S, 1.6'x1.0', with the widest part of the anvil on the south end.  NGC 2032, another very bright section, is very close preceding (roughly 1.6' between centers) and the two sections are separated by a dark lane oriented SSW-NNE.  A very faint streamer attached on the NE side flows to the north (NGC 2032 has a similar but brighter streamer).  A fairly small detached patch, ~1.2' in diameter, is close SE (identified as LHA 120-N 59C in SIMBAD).


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2035 = D 219 on 27 Sep 1826 and described a "pretty bright round nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, bright towards the centre".  He states 2 observations were made and his published position is within the Seagull Nebula complex.  As NGC 2032/2035 are the brightest sections, this identification seems reasonable.


JH first observed this bright nebula on 23 Dec 1834 and called NGC 2035 = h2916, "B, L, bM. The 3rd of three which run together.  (Plate III, fig 5)".  On his next observation he recorded "pB, L, R. The third of 3 which run together." Herschel gave an uncertain equivalence with D 220 in the CGH.

30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): very bright, fairly large, irregular, mottled, brighter core, 50" diameter.  A bright, tiny knot of mag 15.5 stars is at the southeast end.  A couple of additional mag 16 stars are resolved near the edges.  A mag 10.7 star lies 4' NNE.  NGC 2028 lies 8' NW.


BSDL 2464 = OGLE-CL LMC 611 was noticed 2.6' NE as a very faint, small glow, 20" diameter.  A couple of very faint stars were resolved at the east end.  The mag 10.7 star noted above lies 2.7' NW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2036 = h2917 on 11 Nov 1836 and recorded "vF; R; gbM; 90"."  There is nothing at his position, but one degree south is the cluster S-L 587.  Herschel's added a note to his description that there was likely an error of 1° in the polar distance and clearly this was the case.  Eric Lindsay, in the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289) comments "The Decl. seems to be in error. The object is probably the small cluster S/L 587 at 1° south. Herschel found strong ground to suspect an error of a degree in P.D. which should most likely be 160° and not 159°."  As this cluster is exactly 1° S of h's position, the identification is virtually certain.


Also, see historical notes for NGC 2043, which may be a duplicate observation with the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 230x): very small high surface brightness glow, ~12" diameter.  Situated with the large stellar association LH 81, this cluster is collinear with a 2' string of mag 12, 11 and 13 stars extending south-southwest.  HD 37680, a mag 13.2 Wolf-Rayet star, is 1.8' W.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2037 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and listed it as #593 in his preliminary catalogue of"Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  The only information he gives (besides a position) is type "Cl" and Mag 8.  There is no listing or description in the main CGH catalogue, so along with nearby NGC 2033, it is unknown if Herschel was describing a small knot or a very large field of stars + nebulosity in association LH 81, though the magnitude implies a bright object.  NGC 2037 is taken as the small cluster OGLE-CL LMC 605 at 05 34 40 -69 44.8 (2000) by Archinal and Hynes, Mati Morel and Jenni Kay.  Harold Corwin remarks this cluster is too faint to have been picked up by Herschel with his 5-inch refractor and certainly wouldn't be described as 8th magnitude.  So, the standard identification (given here) is almost certainly wrong.

24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, 40" diameter, clumpy but no individual stars resolved.  First of three nearly on a line with NGC 2056 11' SE and NGC 2075 20' SE.  Located 4' SSE of mag 9.5 HD 37732.


Jenni Kay (12.5" @110x): very obvious - bright, small, round, hazy glow.  The cluster is the first of 3 small, bright, hazy glows arching across the field from west to east.  150x: improved - very bright, round, 40" in size, with a smooth and even glow from edge to edge.

Size 30'


18" (1/26/09): large, scattered field with a number of mag 8 to 10 stars, though too dispersed to resemble a cluster.  the most distinctive part is a nice 8' string of 6 collinear stars oriented E-W with mag 8 HD 38096 at the west end and mag 8.5 HD 38163 at the east end.  A larger elongated group of stars extends to the SE out to the edge of the 35' field.  This group probably contains unrelated field stars and there is no listing in SIMBAD.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2039 = h366 on 8 Jan 1828 (sweep 118) and described "A large tract of stars filling many fields.  It extends much further in RA."  He equated this observation with H VIII-2 = NGC 2063, so he may have confused these two fields at the time.  His father's object is either nonexistent or just an asterism ~40' to the east.  On a second sweep, JH logged "A large ill-defined tract of loose stars, neither rich nor condensed".  He used two numbers in the GC for h366 and H VIII-2, so both objects received their own NGC designation.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 survey based on Heidelberg plates, states "many st, Cl not well defined."  See Corwin's notes for further discussion.

V = 11.5;  Size 2'


30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 202x and 264x + NPB filter; bright, very large, irregular nebula just east of NGC 2030/2032/2035 (Dragon's Head or Seagull Nebula).  The main portion is roughly triangular with one "vertex" on the south side and another on the northeast end.  It has a sharp, contrasty edge on the east side to the south tip and some internal, irregular brightness in the interior.  Unfiltered a dozen stars mag 14-15 are involved (association LH 88), with several more spreading to the south.


NGC 2040 is merged with a supernova remnant shell (SNR B0536-67.6) on the south side.  On images the shell is ~2' in diameter, with a complex interlaced web of delicate filaments.  Visually, I could see a very faint, thin curving loop, ~45" in length, which forms the southwest end of the shell (brightest part on images). A mag 13.5 star (O5-type) is in the interior of the shell, with the observed strip centered 40" to its WSW. This star was possibly bound to the precursor star of the SNR remnant.


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a bright, irregularly round glow, ~2' diameter, located ~4' ENE of the Seagull or Dragon's Head Nebula and part of the same emission complex.  The nebulosity surrounds a cluster of roughly 15 stars (LH 88).  A UHC filter provided an excellent contrast gain at 200x and revealed a very irregular outline.  The POSS image shows delicate filaments to the south forming a large loop (SNR shell SNR 0536-67.6) although I don't believe this extension was recorded.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2040 = h2918 on 2 Nov 1834 and recorded "F; irreg R; glbM; r; 2'. (Pl III, fig 5)."  On a later sweep he reported "vF; R; follows 3 vB L nebulae [NGC 2030, NGC 2032 and NGC 2035] which run together."  His position (from 5 sweeps) is accurate and an excellent sketch of the complex is on plate III, figure 3.


James Dunlop possibly discovered this nebula (D 220) earlier on 27 Sep 1826 and logged "a round faint nebula, about 40" diameter."  His position is just 4' NNW of the center of LMC N59B = NGC 2040, but given the range of his positional errors, it's possible this observation either refers to nearby NGC 2032 or 2035 (part of the same complex).

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, this LMC cluster appears bright, fairly small, round, 1' diameter, high surface brightness.  Symmetrical appearance and increases to a very small bright core and a stellar nucleus.  This young, massive cluster is located ~7' SE of the elongated cluster NGC 2034 at the east end of the very large, extended collection of associations (the "Quadrant") that includes NGC 2026 and 2002 on the western side.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2041 = h2919 on 2 Nov 1834 and described as "B, S, vgbM, 20"."  On a second sweep he noted  "a rich clustering part precedes."  His position (measured on 4 sweeps) is accurate.  Wolfgang Steinicke and Glen Cozens both credit James Dunlop with the discovery on 6 Nov 1826.  His entry for D 241 describes "a large cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes in strong nebula; irregular extended figure."  His position is 6.6' NW of the cluster, but his description implies a much larger object - like NGC 2027/2034 and the position is a closer match.

25" (4/3/19 - OzSky): very large group of stars with unresolved haze (association LH 89), extending nearly 10' from north to south and contains a couple of knots of stars, a few dozen mag 12-14 stars, a mag 10.3 star at the west tip and numerous mag 15+ stars.


BRHT 16a, situated near the center, is a very bright knot near the center, ~10" diameter.  A very faint star was resolved at the west edge.

KMHK 1122, on the north east side (2' NW of BRHT 16a), resolved into a 10" pair of stars at the center, encased in a very small glow.  Several stars (mostly faint) were resolved nearby including two two mag 12.5 and 12.8 stars close east of the central pair and some mag 15 stars around the edges.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly large patch of stars and haze (association LH 89), ~5' in size.  At least two dozen stars are resolved in an elongated group oriented SW-NE, including a few mag 10 stars over unresolved stars or outer nebulous haze from the Tarantula complex.  Two additional knots are to the northwest and form an obtuse isosceles triangle with NGC 2042.  The first knot is KMHK 1122 situated 5' NW and S-L 585 is 10' NW.  NGC 2042 is located just 17' NW of the center of the Tarantula Nebula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2042 = h2922 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "the chief star (9th mag) of a large, irregular figured, looped or hooked cluster of stars 12..15th mag, rich and various, and filling the field."  His description and position applies to the assocation LH 89.


This object may have been discovered earlier by James Dunlop.  His D181, described as a "small faint nebula, 10" or 12" diameter" is 5.5' NW of center of the association.  But the description doesn't match an object of this size.  His D 140, described as "a small faint round nebula" is a similar distance SW of center, but again the description is a very poor match.  Finally D 183, described as "a faint ill-defined nebula, 20" diameter", is ~8' NE but another poor match in description.  So, I'm not confident any of these observations referring to NGC 2042.

NGC 2043

= N-S string of stars (asterism), Corwin and Gottlieb.


Pietro Baracchi discovered NGC 2043 on 18 Dec 1884 with the 48-inch f/41 Great Melbourne Telescope while examining the field of NGC 2058 and other clusters.  Earlier observers Le Sueur and Joseph Turner had previously observed and sketched this field on 7 Feb 1870 and 26 Apr 1876, respectively. Baracchi's new object was confirmed 4 nights later and described as a "small elongated group of minute stars in very thin nebula."  Robert Ellery, the observatory director, noted the discovery in "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885" and stated an offset  "preceding H. 1259 [NGC 2058] by 79.5 sec and 4' 30" north."  Eric Lindsay reported "Not found. Star-rich region but no evidence of clustering.  Not listed by Herschel. In the Melbourne Catalogue." ("Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud", IAJ, 6, 286-289, 1964).


Harold Corwin suggested NGC 2043 is a N-S string of stars (about 1.7' length) situated 2.5' S of Baracchi's position, which is a good match with his description.  I located Baracchi's sketch in his notebook in 2018 (found online at the National Archives of Australia), which confirms Corwin's identification as a N-S string of stars.


ESO and SIMBAD misidentify ESO 056-168, an extremely faint cluster close to Baracchi's position, as NGC 2043.

V = 10.6;  Size 4.5'


25" (4/3/19 - OzSky): at 244x; NGC 2044 is a striking group of stars, tiny clusters and weak nebulosity.  The 3 main "knots" are BRHT 17a and 17b (separated by 1' E-W) and KMK88 87, which is 2' N of 17b.  A few dozen stars are resolved in total, mostly in a E-W stream containing the BRHT pair and fainter stars in a vertical stream at the west end of the group (association LH 90). At the north end of the vertical stream is  mag 13.9 HD 269818 (Brey 62), a Wolf-Rayet star and just north of BRHT 17b is Brey 57, an easy mag 13.5 Wolf-Rayet.


BRHT 17a: very bright 20" knot, very clumpy, a few individual stars were barely resolved.

BRHT 17b: very bright 15" knot containing a few stars that nearly resolved, but were too closely packed to resolve in the seeing conditions.  One of these is the Wolf-Rayet star Brey 65 (listed at mag 13.0).

KMK88 87: fairly bright, elongated SSW-NNE glow, bright center, 25" diameter.  With a more critical gaze, it resolved into a quasi-stellar center (probably 2 or more stars) with resolved stars at the SSW and NNE ends.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): group of about a dozen stars in a 3' diameter at 171x dominated by three brighter stars in a E-W string.  Two of the "stars" in this line are actually compact clusters (BRHT 17a and 17b). The western "star" (HD 269828 = BRHT 17b) has been resolved into 15+ components including W-R star Brey 65 and the eastern "star" (BRHT 17a) into 9+ components.  A mag 13.5 star on the NW side is the W-R Brey 57.  Another mag 12 "star" just 2' NNW of HD 269828 is also a compact cluster (KMK88 87).


NGC 2044 is situated in the outer portion of the 30 Doradus complex, 16' SW from the central core, and is the central cluster in a 6' diameter Superbubble.  Like NGC 2060, this stellar association (LH 90) also harbors a young SNR!  The site of SNR 1987A (05 35 28, -69 16.2) lies only 5.5' SW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2044 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and listed as #608 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  His position is ~1' south of the center of this cluster/association (LH 90).

At 200x, it appeared bright, fairly small, slightly elongated WSW-ENE in the direction of a mag 13 star just 0.8' SW.  The core seems offset from the center to the NE end or a compact knot of stars is attached at the following end.  NGC 2047 lies 3.2' NNE.  Located 6' SE of mag 8.2 HD 37762.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2046 = h2923 on 11 Nov 1836 and wrote, "vF; R; gbM; the first of a group of six nebulae."  His position and sketch (Pl IV, fig 9) is accurate.


Albert Le Sueur sketched the group on 7 Feb 1870 as well as Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876 and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is located on the west side of a rich field of 8 NGC clusters in the 13mm Ethos (200x).  It appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter.  A faint star is at the south edge.  Forms a pair with slightly brighter NGC 2046 3.2' SSW.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2047 = h2925 on 11 Nov 1836 and described as "the second of a group.  Pl IV, fig 9."  His position and sketch is accurate.


The entire group of clusters (NGC 2046, 2047, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2065, 2066) was sketched by Le Sueur on 7 Feb 1870, as well as Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876 and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884, all using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.  Le Sueur's sketch is plate IV, figure 32 and Turner's is figure 33 in "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885".

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x + NPB filter): NGC 2048 is a bright elongated glow, ~1'x0.7' E-W, surrounded by fainter nebulous haze extending 3'-4' in diameter.  The emission component (LHA 120-N 154A) is cradled around the south and east side by a large, semicircular chain with mostly mag 12 stars and a total length of ~15' (association LH 87).  At the west end of this chain is HD 37836, a mag 10.6 emission-line B0 star.


NGC 2048 is situated in a glorious region of the LMC; extending to the southwest is NGC 2033 = LH 81, a large stellar association (the stars on the south side of the semicircular chain are likely members) and further north is NGC 2055 = LH 96, a huge rich cloud just south of the Tarantula Nebula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2048 = h2926 in 1834-1835 (exact sweep or date unknown as based on a sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) region made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835) and described as "a very faint large oval ill-defined nebula; not taken in sweeping, but laid down from a careful drawing.  See Notes on Catalogue of Nubecula Major".  His position is 3' NE of the center of this nebula.  Hodge and Wright describe it as "possibly only 2-3 stars in nebulosity" in their LMC Atlas.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x): NGC 2050 was taken as a 2'-3' patch of stars on the north side of the large stellar association LH 96, a 15'x10' cloud of roughly 120 stars.  At 145x, ~20 stars were resolved including HD 37974, mag 10.9 blue supergiant at the west edge and a mag 10.7 star (11" double) at the southwest edge.  The central part contains several mag 12 stars.  A long stream of mag 10-12 stars begins about 12' SW of the cluster and extends east-northeast for over 20', passing just south of the Tarantula Nebula, and heads towards NGC 2100.  Several of the nearby stars in this stream may also be part of NGC 2050.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 173x, appears as just a locally brighter spot containing perhaps a dozen stars over a hazy background glow (stellar association LH 93), ~2' in diameter.  Embedded in the edge of an amazing 15'-20' linear stream of stars (association LH 93/94) which runs through the field from east-northeast to west-southwest.  This long chain passes just off the south side of the tendrils of the Tarantula Nebula and heads towards NGC 2050!   NGC 2050 is situated 30' SW of the center of the Tarantula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2050 = h2928 in 1834-1835 (exact date unknown as based on a sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835).  He described this object "Cl VI; vF st and nebulosity of irregular branching figure, or rather 3 clusters connected.  See Notes on Catalogue of Nubecula Major."  His position falls in the north-central portion of NGC 2055, a very large association and probably included part of the stream of stars mentioned in my description..  See Harold Corwin's notes for more on this object.

Two additional S-L clusters (617 and 624) share the field 8.5' SSE.  The cluster is also equidistant from a mag 9 star 8' NW and mag 7.6 HD 37899 a similar distance SW.


S-L 617 is the southwestern member of a pair of S-L clusters.  At 200x it appeared faint, moderately large, round, 30" diameter.  Overall it was larger but with a lower surface brightness than S-L 624 located 3.5' NE.  Located ~5' ESE of a mag 7.6 star.


S-L 624 appeared as a fairly faint, compact knot, ~20" diameter, with a fairly high surface brightness.  A mag 11.7 star is 1.9' SW and S-L 617 lies 3.5' SW.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x): without a filter this emission nebula (N155) is a very faint, small patch perhaps 35" diameter, only a couple of faint stars are involved.  Situated midway between a mag 12 star 2' W and a mag 12.5 star 2' ENE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2052 = h2929 in 1834-1835 (sweep number and date unknown as based on a sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) region made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835) and described as "vvF, vvL, vglbM."  Herschel changed the description in the GC to read "eF, vvS, vglbM" (probably an error) and this was copied by Dreyer into the NGC.  His position is 2.5' SW of the faint HII region Henize N155, which the Hodge-Wright Atlas and the ESO identify as NGC 2052.   There are no other nearby candidates.  Harold Corwin suggests "NGC 2052 may be the large diffuse nebula 2 minutes of time preceding JH's position.  But it may not be."


Eric Lindsay, in the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289), notes "Should be 2.3m E of NGC 2033. It may be a small group slightly NE in which is Henize N155.  Dreyer and Herschel differ as to size [actually Herschel changed the size]. Position measured by Herschel from a drawing and not during a sweep."

George Bond discovered NGC 2054 = HN 3 on 6 Oct 1850 with a 4-inch comet-seeker at the Harvard College Observatory.  He mentioned that it required confirmation and JH didn't include this object in the GC.  Dreyer observed the cluster using the 72" at Birr Castle on 13 Jan 1877 and reported "vF, pS, iR, at times I thought it was a very small cluster, but it is doubtful".   Nevertheless, he included it in the GC Supplement (GC 5354).  Herbert Howe observed it around 1899 using a 20" refractor and noted "it appears to be simply a small triangle composed of 2 stars of mag 12, and one of mag 13."  Bigourdan's position from 26 Dec 1891 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) also corresponds with three mag 14.5, 14.7 and 14.9 stars within 30", along with a couple of fainter stars.

V = 8.4;  Size 15'x10'


14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x): roughly 120 stars are resolved in a gorgeous 15'x10' SW-NE star cloud (association LH 96) situated to the south of the Tarantula Nebula.  The cloud is rich in faint stars but also includes a mag 9.6 star (HD 269820) at the southwest edge, along with a few other mag 10.5 stars.  The background shows unresolved haze and perhaps nebulosity.  Adding an NPB filter, there is definite nebulosity in the northeastern quadrant of the cloud.  It spreads northwest and northeast, merging with the outer tendrils of the Tarantula Nebula!


Within this cloud is S-L 610 (often misidentified as NGC 2055), a small knot of four stars in a 1' region.  It includes two bright "stars" (R127, V ≈  10.5 and R128, V ≈ 10.7 ) at 20" separation, along with two 12th mag stars to the northwest.  Both R127 and R128 are very compact clusters with R127 containing the brightest Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) in the LMC!  NGC 2050 is probably a group of stars on the north side of the cloud.  Roughly ~20 stars were resolved including a mag 10.6 star at the west edge and a mag 10.7 star (11" double) at the southwest edge.  The central part contains several mag 12 stars and HD 38030, a mag 13.0 Wolf-Rayet (Brey 68).


A long stream of mag 10-12 stars begins about 12' W of the cluster and extends east-northeast for over 20', including NGC 2050 and association LH 97 at the NE corner of the large star cloud, and passing just south of the Tarantula Nebula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2055 = h2931 on 24 Nov 1834 and noted "a vL v rich cluster of sc st 10...15 which more than fills the field."  His position is near the center of this large association or star cloud (LH 96), which includes NGC 2050 and S-L 610.

Second of three with NGC 2038 11' NW and NGC 2075 9' ESE.  Mag 9.3 HD 38174 is near the midpoint of NGC 2056 and 2075.  Mag 10.5 HD 269825 lies 3.6' SSW and a mag 11 star is 2.5' N.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2056 = h2932 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "pB, R, bM, the preceding of 2 [with NGC 2075] on the same parallel; a star 9 mag between."  His position is ~30" SE of center of this cluster.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is on the south side of a field filled with 8 NGC clusters.  At 260x it appeared bright, fairly small, round, ~30" diameter, fairly well concentrated with a small bright core.  Situated on a line between NGC 2065 4' NE and a mag 10.4 HD 269839 3' SW.  NGC 2046 lies 6.8' WNW, 2047 7.0' NW and 2058 6.4' N.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2057 = D 104? on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a very small faint nebula, 8" or 10" diameter." He made a single observation and his position is 11' SE of this cluster.  Assuming Dunlop also picked up NGC 2057 = D 104 and NGC 2065 = D 105, this identification is reasonable.  John Herschel independently discovered NGC 2057 = h2935 on 11 Nov 1836 and recorded "pF; S; R; gbM; the 5th (4th properly) of a group of 6, RA only estimated from a rough diagram incorrect (as it would seem) in the order of the objects."


The entire group of clusters (NGC 2046, 2047, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2065, 2066) was sketched by Le Sueur, Joseph Turner and Pietro Baracchi in 1870, 1876 and 1884 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.  Le Sueur's sketch was reproduced as plate IV, figure 32 and Turner's sketch in plate IV, figure 33 in in "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885".  Turner's sketch shows a star or clump bulging out the southeast side, though Baracchi's sketch shows a narrow extension to the north towards a faint star.

All 8 clusters easily fit in the field of 13mm Ethos at 200x within a 20' circle.  Using 260x, NGC 2058 appeared very bright, large, well concentrated.  The outer halo extends up to 2' diameter using averted vision.  At 350x, a few very faint stars are resolved in the halo and around the edges of the core.  Two mag 12.5-13 stars lie 1' WSW and 1.5' WNW.  Other nearby clusters include NGC 2059 2' N, NGC 2066 4.1' E, NGC 2047 5.4' WSW and NGC 2065 5.8' SE.  I also picked up a couple of "anonymous" clusters or HII knots.  OGLE-CL LMC 632 is north of NGC 2059 and LHA 120-N171B is following NGC 2072.  This group of clusters is located just over a degree south of the Tarantula Nebula.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2058 = D 103 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a A round well-defined nebula, 30" diameter, bright at the centre.  The preceding of three nebulae forming a triangle"  He made a single observation and his position is just 3.7' NW of the cluster. On 11 Nov 1836, John Herschel called this cluster (h2933), "B; R; gbM; 90"; the 3rd of a group of 6."  Three sweeps later he observed the cluster again as "vB; R; the 3rd of a group of 7.  Pl IV, fig 9."  His position and sketch is accurate.  John Herschel equated Dunlop 102 with h2933, which Dunlop described as "a faint ill-defined nebula, perhaps 3' diameter".  The large size, though, makes this identification unlikely.


The entire group of clusters (NGC 2046, 2047, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2065, 2066) was sketched by Le Sueur on 7 Feb 1870, Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876 and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2059 = h2936 on 11 Nov 1836 and reported "vF; the 5th (4th in MS) of a group of 6.  Pl IV, fig 9."  His position and sketch is accurate.


The cluster was sketched using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope by Le Sueur on 7 Feb 1870, Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876 and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884 .  Le Sueur's and Turner's sketches were published in "Observations of Southern Nebulae made with the Great Melbourne Telescope 1869 - 1885" on plate IV, figure 32 and figure 33.  Both observers drew the cluster elongated N-S.


The Hodge-Wright Atlas misidentifies OGLE-CL LMC 632 (too far north) as NGC 2059.  Interestingly, Pietro Baracchi's sketch of the field on 18 Dec 1884 with the GMT, shows OGLE-CL LMC 632 as a nebulous object close northwest of NGC 2059, directly south of a star labeled as 15th magnitude

A mag 12 "star" at the north edge (Brey 73 = TLD1) is actually a very compact cluster with over a dozen components, including the Wolf-Rayet star.


NGC 2060 harbors a compact x-ray source and a rapidly rotating pulsar, indicating an obscured Crab-like supernova remnant (1998 IAU Circ., 6810, 2).  The cluster also contains VFTS 102, the most rapidly rotating massive O-type star known, which is possibly related to the pulsar.


25" (4/3/19 - OzSky): at 244x; Brey 73 appeared as a very high surface brightness knot (V = 12.1), ~12" diameter, with a mag 13.7 star at the SE edge.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2060 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and listed it as #642 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major." (not included in his main CGH catalogue).  His position corresponds with this SNR on the southwest side of the Tarantula nebula.

18" (1/15/07): at 115x I was initially attacted by a large, bright trapezoid-shaped asterism of 5 stars with a pair of 9.5-magnitude stars at 35" separation at the NW vertex.  The brightest star in the asterism is a mag 7.2 orange star at the NE vertex with an 11th magnitude companion (h3794).  But John Herschel was likely referring to an 8' scattering of a couple of dozen mag 13 and fainter stars that lie to the north of the bright star.  This group appears to be a random collection at the eyepiece.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2061 = h2924 on 9 Jan 1836 and logged "Cluster, 8th class, course, loose and filling the field; stars 10...13m.  Place that of a double star in a vacant part."  There is no double star at Herschel's position though exactly 1.0 minute of RA west is the double star HJ 3794 (7.7/11.6 at 20" separation) with a mean position of 05 42 53.2 -33 57 29 (J2000).  There is a scattering of stars extending 8' north and five brighter stars to the south.  The ESO position is 05 42 42 -34 00.6 (2000), and classified as a group of stars.   The Helwan Observatory (1921 list of observations) reported "No cluster here.  Exposure 100 minutes."  This was repeated by Dorothy Carlson in her NGC correction paper as well as the RNGC.

18" (4/6/16 - Coonabarabran, 236x): moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 30" diameter, mottled. Some extremely faint stars are on the verge of resolution including one at the north or northeast edge.  Two mag 9.8 stars lie 1.6' S and 2.9' SSW.  A small, low surface patch, ~20"x15" NW-SE, was noticed 4.7' W.  On the DSS, it appears to be a possible uncatalogued LMC cluster.  S-L 643 lies 10' SSE.  It appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, smooth surface brightness.  Located 4.7' E of mag 8.4 HD 38305. A mag 12 star is 2' SE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2062 = h2937 on 3 Jan 1837 and recorded "vF; E; glbM; 40"; north of 2 stars 10m."  His position is 1 tmin too far west, but his declination matches this cluster and two bright stars lie to the south, so the identification is certain.  Eric Lindsay first noted this error in "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289), "Position should probably be 1.3m E corresponding to S/L 640."

18" (1/26/09): although nothing stands out in the field, near William Herschel's position is a group of 30 stars elongated N-S in a string.  Includes mag 10.1 HD 247555 near the north end, though the richest concentration is at the south end (7' S from the bright star).


Other observers have picked brighter groupings in the area as NGC 2063 and WH's description of "a small cluster of very small scattered stars" is not very helpful.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent and in any case this number likely applies to an asterism and not a true cluster.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2063 = H VIII-2 on 26 Dec 1783 (very early sweep 67) and logged "A small Cl of scattered stars."  In a second sweep (28 Dec 1785) he reported "A few pretty closely scattered very small stars." JH equated his h366 = NGC 2039 with his father's H VIII-2, but these are two diferent star fields.  Harold Corwin notes there is only a small grouping of faint stars near WH's position although a larger and brighter patch of stars is ~8' south-southeast.  In any case, this is likely just a random group of stars.  The position given in Archinal and Hynes (Star Clusters) to the west of NGC 2039 is incorrect.  See Corwin's notes.

Located 7' SW of M78 and 4' SE of a mag 10.5 star.  The large listed dimensions refer to a very elongated strip extending NNE on the west side of M78.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2064 near M78 on 11 Jan 1864.  He noted a mag 9-10 star was 4' north-preceding and measured an accurate position (2 nights).  The visual extent is much smaller than the catalogued dimensions.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this LMC cluster appeared very bright, fairly large, round, 1.2' diameter, weak concentration.  With averted vision, the surface is mottled and the outer halo increases to at least 1.5'.  The cluster appeared very lively at 350x with a few stars just on the verge of resolution.  At this power the halo appeared up to 1.8' in diameter.  A mag 12 star is at the NE edge and two mag 13/13.5 stars lie ~1.5' WNW.  Eight NGC clusters reside in this one field with four other clusters within 6': NGC 2057 4' SW, NGC 2066 4.2' N, NGC 2072 4' E and NGC 2058 5.8' NW!


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2065 = D 105 on 24 Sep 1826 and described "a round well-defined nebula, 25" diameter."  He made two observations and his position is 9' SE of this cluster.  On 11 Oct 1836, John Herschel found the cluster and reported h2938 as "pB; R; last of group of 6.  Pl IV, fig 9."  Three sweeps later he noted "B; the 6th of a group of 7."  His position and sketch is accurate.  He questioned if this object was D 103, though D 105 seems a better match.


The entire group of clusters (NGC 2046, 2047, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2065, 2066) was sketched by Le Sueur on 7 Feb 1870, Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876 and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2066 = h2939 on 12 Nov 1836 and noted "vF and S; the last of a group of 7; this nebula escaped notice sweep 748.  Plate IV, fig 9."  The sketch on Plate IV accurately places the 7 clusters (flipped right-left and upside down).


The entire group of clusters (NGC 2046, 2047, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2065, 2066) was sketched by Joseph Turner on 26 Apr 1876  and Pietro Baracchi on 18 Dec 1884 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.

[It's not clear from my description whether I observed the very low surface brightness circular patch NW of M78 or the brightest portion of the streamer pointing towards NGC 2064].


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2067 = T I-17 in 1876 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory.  His position and rough tranlation of his description (in German) points to the very faint nebulosity to the northwest of M78.  Harold Corwin lists two possible regions as the intended object - "a large patch of pretty low surface brightness nebulosity about 5 arcmin northwest of M78" and "a knot about 3 arcmin southwest, the brightest part of a long faint streamer pointed toward NGC 2064".  It's possible that Tempel's nebula applies to both sections.

17.5" (12/20/95): very bright reflection nebula surrounding two mag 10.5 stars with a mag 13 star involved at the south end.  Large, irregular shape, 6'x4'.  Brightest along the north side which has a sharply defined slightly bowed-out edge with one of the mag 10.5 stars near the midpoint.  A brighter knot is just following this star.  The nebula irregularly fans out towards the south and fades with no distinct borders but tapers somewhat at the south edge.


17.5" (2/1/92):very bright, surprisingly large, 6'x4'.  Surrounds two mag 10 stars although the nebulosity extends further to east of these stars.  Also a mag 13 star is embedded in the SE end.  Brighter and sharper edge gently curves from west to north side.  Appears to fan out to the SE where the nebula gradually fades into background.  Brightest in a group of reflection nebulae including NGC 2064 7' SW and NGC 2067 6' WNW.


8" (12/6/80): bright reflection nebula, large, NW edge brighter and sharper, elongated, roughly rectangular, wide pair of mag 10 stars involved, striking.  Brightest in a group of reflection nebulae.


Pierre Méchain discovered M78 = NGC 2068 = h368 in March 1780.  On 19 Dec 1783 William Herschel described M78 as "Two large [bright] stars, well defined, within a nebulous glare of light resembling that in Orion's sword. There are also three very small [faint] stars just visible in the nebulous part which seem to be component particles thereof. I think there is a faint ray near 1/2 deg long towards the east and another towards the south east less extended, but I am not quite so well assured of the reality of these latter phenomena as I could wish, and would rather ascribe them to some deception. At least I shall suspend my judgement till I have seen it again in very fine weather, tho' the night is far from bad."  M78 was the first reflection nebula that was discovered.


On 9 Jan 1856 the observer on the 72" (R.J. Mitchell) wrote, "in finder eyepiece a B oval neb with n and nf edges brightest and best defined, and sp edge fading away gradually; with higher power there is seen a decided darkness at and between the stars.  I can confirm previous observation as to the curve formed by the brightest part of the neb."

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the northern outer loop of the Tarantula Nebula which Dunlop and Herschel catalogued separately.  Several mag 12-13 stars are involved, including mag 13.1 HDE 269926 (Brey 88), a massive Wolf-Rayet binary (WN4+OB).  In addition, mag 11.1 HD 38282, an extremely massive Wolf-Rayet binary (Brey 89) is close east of the south end and HD 38344, another mag 13 WR star is 1.6' further E.  See observing notes for NGC 2070.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2069 = D 143 on 3 Aug 1826 with his 9 reflector and noted a "A pretty large, faint, ill-defined nebula, elongated in the direction of the meridian."  His position is 2'-3' too far north (unusually accurate for him).  JH recorded h2940 on 24 Nov 1834 as "the middle of a large extended faint nebulous mass which forms the northern branch of the great looped nebula, and is almost, or entirely, detached from it. See the next object [Tarantula Nebula]."

05 38 42 -69 06 03; Dor

V = 5;  Size 40'


24" (11/18/12 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x unfiltered, I examined the 30 Doradus cluster = R136 cluster at the heart of the Tarantula Nebula.  The cluster is dominated by R136a, a 10th magnitude bloated "star" at the center that would not focus sharply.  Surrounding this star was a compact but very rich carpet of dozens of mag 14-15.5 stars packed into a 1' region that were much too numerous to count.


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  The Tarantula nebula was simply unreal at 200x in the 13mm Ethos with a UHC filter -- better than any photo I've seen and convincingly 3-dimensional, even though I viewed it late so the elevation was only 20°.  Although this magnification brought out an unbelievable amount of detail in the loops and ribbons, the main complex fit snugly in the eyepiece field (30').


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the Tarantula is the largest known emission region (800-1000 light years) and is easily visible to the naked-eye from Australia.  The view of the Tarantula early in the morning through a 20" f/5 at 127x (20 Nagler) and OIII filter was jaw-dropping!  Near the center are several bright loops and arcs.  Extending out are a number of convoluted loops including one heart-shaped arch which is quite large.  Running out from the central region of the nebula are streaming lanes of nebulosity.  One in particular extends quite a long distance and the outer loops and streamers seem to merge into some of the nearby HII regions forming a mind-boggling complex.  There are perhaps 10 different loops and ribbons in the main body giving a 3-dimensional effect.


Near the center lies an extremely compact cluster of superluminous stars (R136) but only a few were visible including what appears to be a single bright star.  A large number of additional stars are scattered about the main body. Mag 11.9 HDE 269928 (Wolf-Rayet = Brey 90) is 1.3' E of R136.  Additional WR stars are mag 11.6 Brey 87 0.9' N of center and mag 13.5 Brey 80 1.5' NW of center.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 2060 lies 6.5' SW of the central cluster (R136) of the Tarantula.  It appeared as a fairly small knot of nebulosity, ~2' diameter, with about a half-dozen mag 12-14 stars involved (association LH 99) in the glow.  A mag 12 "star" on the north edge has been resolved into a very compact cluster by the HST. Studies have shown this nebula contains a compact x-ray source and a rapidly rotating pulsar, indicating NGC 2060 is a Crab-like supernova remnant in the LMC (1998 IAU Circ., 6810, 2).


Hodge 301 is the oldest cluster in the Tarantula (age 25-30 million years) and is situated just 3' NW of the central cluster (R136). It appeared as a coompact 30" knot with a half-dozen mag 13-14 stars resolved over haze.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): first view of the Tarantula in Les Dalrymple's 12" was early in the evening, very low in the southern sky (20° elevation) and without a filter.  Even under these conditions it was a fascinating sight – fairly bright, detailed, 15' convoluted, mottled nebulosity with several striking loops or ribbons which radiate out from the central region.  Sweeping in the nearby fields I ran across numerous small knots of nebulosity and small clusters.


10x30mm (1/21/12): I viewed the Tarantula Nebula in a 19" dobsonian (pointed horizontally) and in my IS binoculars. At a declination of -69.1°, the Tarantula just skimmed the horizon from the 9300' Mauna Kea Visitor Center, culminating 1.1° above the horizon!  Still with atmospheric refraction, it was obvious in the binoculars. There was too much extinction and seeing effects for much structure in the 19".


Naked-eye: at 5th magnitude or so, the Tarantula is obvious from a fairly dark site as a small, fuzzy patch on the eastern side of the LMC, north of the central bar.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 2070 = Lac I-2 = D 142 = h2941 in 1751-1752 using a half-inch refractor at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He included it in his 1755 catalogue as Class I No. 2 and remarked "like the former [NGC 104: "like the nucleus of a fairly bright comet] but faint."  James Dunlop reported D 142 as "a pretty large ill-defined nebula, of an irregular branched figure, with a pretty bright small star in the south side of the centre, which gives it the appearance of a nucleus. This is resolvable into very minute stars - Figure 4. is a very good representation of the nebula resolved. (N.B. The 30 Doradus is surrounded by a number of nebulae of considerable magnitudes, nine or ten in number, with the 30 Doradus in the centre.)"


On his first observation from the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel noted "the great nebula; an assemblage of loops." He later discussed in detail, "This is one of the most singular and extraordinary objects which the heavens present, and derives no small addition to its intrinsic interest from its situation, which is among the thickest of the nebulae and clustering groups of the greater Nubecula, of whose total area it occupies one-five hundredth part. For these reasons, as well as because its real nature has been completely misunderstood, and its magnified appearance so strangely misrepresented in the only figure which I am aware to have been made of it as to convey an entirely erroneous impression both of its form and structure; I have taken great pains to give as nearly as possible a perfect representation of it as it appeared in the twenty-feet reflector on a great many occasions, but more especially on the 29th November, 1834, when a 'very careful drawing' was made of it by the eye alone, unaided by any micrometrical measures; and on the 21st and 22nd December, 1835, when the nebula was worked in from the telescope on a 'skeleton' previously prepared by an approximate reduction of the micrometrical measures of its principle stars, forming a chart, with a system of triangles, for its reception and for that of minute stars not susceptible of micrometric measurement, or not considered as of sufficient importance to be so measured. This is the only mode in which correct monographs can be executed of nebulae of this kind which consist of complicated windings and ill-defined members obliterated by the smallest illumination of the field of view; and in which the small stars, when very numerous, can be mapped down with tolerable precision. The following catalogue contains all the stars which I have been able distinctly to perceive within the area occupied by the nebula and nearly adjacent to it... [The catalogue contains 105 stars.] The stars thus scattered over the area occupied by this nebula may or may not be systematically connected with it, either as an individual object, or as part of the vast and complex system which constitutes the Nubecula. In respect of their arrangement there is nothing to distinguish them from those which occupy the rest of the area covered by the Nubecula, in which every variety of condensation and mode of distribution is to be met with. The nebula itself  (as seen in the 20-feet reflector) is of the milky or irresolvable kind - quite as free from any mottling or incipient stellar appearance as any other nebula which I can remember to have examined with that instrument. Its situation in the Nubecula is immediately adjacent to two large and rich clusters [NGC 2042 and NGC 2055]. Mr Dunlop remarks that 'The 30 Doradus is surrounded by a number of nebulae of considerable magnitudes, nine or ten in number, with the 30 Doradus in the centre.', of which nebulae he gives a figured representation. For what objects these can be intended I am quite at a loss to conjecture, unless they be the brighter portions of the nebulous convolutions seen without their connecting enbranchments. But with this supposition their relative situations, intensities, and magnitudes in the figure alluded to, so far as I am able to judge, appear irreconcilable."

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this prominent HII region (LMC-N158C) and cluster (OB-association LH 101) appeared as a very bright, very large "C" shaped nebula surrounding a semi-circular chain or crown of stars open to the SW.  Two bright mag 10.4 and 11 stars oriented SW-NE (50" separation) lie on the northwest end of this crown. The northeastern luminary consists of a 1.8" pair of OB-stars (TDS 3273 = 11.4/11.8) and a mag 12.5 Wolf-Rayet star just 3" W. The mag 11 star to its southwest (HD 269923) is the brightest single star (A0-class) in the cluster.  In addtion, a mag 12.5 star (O3-class supergiant) is situated on southeast end of the chain.  A bright knot of diameter ~35" is superimposed on the general glow within the northeast side of the "C".  At 216x at least 20 fainter stars were resolved in the chain besides the brighter stars at the ends.

Forms the vertex of an isosceles right triangle with mag 9.4 HD 38174 4.5' W and a mag 10 star 4.5' S.  Third of three clusters with NGC 2056 9' WNW and NGC 2038 20' NW.  NGC 2107 lies 24' ENE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2075 = h2943 on 23 Dec 1834 and logged "B, R, bM, resolved; the following of two on the same parallel [with NGC 2056], a star 9 mag intervening."  His position is at the east edge of this nebulous cluster.

V = 11.7;  Size 1.0'


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the southwest component of a very bright, impressive 2' emission patch with NGC 2080.  At 200x and UHC filter, NGC 2077 appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, ~1.2'x0.6'.  Without a filter, three fainter stars are involved in the glow (one is a massive Wolf-Rayet star Brey 93a).  Forms a close pair with NGC 2080 (Ghost Head Nebula) 1.1' NE.


NGC 2085 and 2086, a smaller pair of bright HII glows, lie 3' and 4' ESE, and the entire collection forms LMC-N160. In addition, a bright complex of HII knots including NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and 2084 (LMC-N159 and O-association LW 105) lies 5' S.  Together these groups form a stunning field about 35' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2077 = h2947 in Dec 1834 (exact sweep date unknown) and described as "The preceding two forming a double nebula.  The place deduced from that of the following and brighter [NGC 2080 = h2950], by Delta RA = 7.1sec, Delta NPD = 20", as they result from the drawing of Dec 4, 1837.  Pl III, figure 4."


James Dunlop discovered the entire complex (D 145) on 24 Sep 1826 and recorded "This is the centre of a large cluster of extremely minute stars, with many very small nebulae in it."  His position is just 4' SE of NGC 2080.  As NGC 2077 has a high surface brightness, it was likely picked up as one of the "very small nebulae in it."

V = 10.9;  Size 0.8'


25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): NGC 2078 is the northwest portion of the multi-sectioned NGC 2078-79-83-84 complex (LMC-N159).  At 244x + NPB filter, it appeared as a bright, elongated N-S patch, ~1.3' in length, with a prominent mag 12.1 star (blue supergiant R128) involved on the south side and two mag 14/14.5 stars on the north end.  It appears brightest on the southern end and dims on the northern end.  NGC 2079, the brightest section, lies 1.7' S.


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the northwest component of an impressive 4' emission nebula filled with bright knots (LMC-N159), several of which form a curving "S" shape.  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared as a fairly bright, moderately large glow surrounding a mag 12 star (B5 supergiant R148) and two fainter stars.  This knot is elongated ~E-W, ~1.2'x0.8' and is encased in a fainter outer halo that extends perhaps 1.5', mostly to the north.  NGC 2079, an extremely bright isolated patch, lies 1.7' S, NGC 2083 is a similar distance to the east and NGC 2084 is 2.5' SE.


R148 forms a 6" pair - not logged in either of the two observations above - with the optical counterpart (V ≈ 14.8) of LMC X-1, a 10 solar-mass black hole and variable X-ray source.  Nearby is the impressive LMC-N160 complex with NGC's 2077 and 2080, another very bright patch of nebulosity 6' N, and NGC's 2085 and 2086, a smaller bright pair, a similar distance to the NE.  This complex, along with LMC-N159, is within the O-association LH 105.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2078 = h2948 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "the north preceding of the four principal nuclei of the nebula of Plate III, figure 4."  Herschel's sketch shows a complex object with 7 condensations or nuclei, involved in nebulosity. The four NGC objects in this grouping are NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and NGC 2084.  Glen Cozens and Wolfgang Steinicke assign Dunlop's #149 (discovered in 1826) to NGC 2078.  Dunlop recorded "a faint round nebula, about 1' diameter" and his position is 6' due east of this emission nebula.  But unless there is additional information available, I don't see how a specific object in this complex can be assigned to D 149.

NGC 2079 = LMC-N159A = ESO 057-11

05 39 40 -69 46 20; Dor

V = 11.8;  Size 1.0'


25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): NGC 2079 = Henize N159A is at the southwest end of the impressive NGC 2078-79-83-84 complex (N159) and has the highest surface brightness.  At 244x + NPB filter it appeared extremely bright, moderately large, with an unusual triangular outline, ~1' diameter, extremely high surface brightness.  A thin fainter strip is on the south end, otherwise, the outline is very sharply defined.  Contains a slightly darker interior region or perhaps a weak dust lane.  Unfiltered a faint star or two is at the center, including the O5-type ionizing source DD 13.  NGC 2079 is just detached from NGC 2084 to the northeast.


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest section of an impressive 4' collection of perhaps 8 different emission knots (collectively LMC-N159) that are encased in a diffuse glow and carry four separate NGC designations. NGC 2079 (LMC-N159A) is situated on the southwest end of the complex and appeared extremely bright, ~1' diameter,with a uniform very high surface brightness.  The outline has an unusual triangular shape (one vertex at the north end) with a well-defined border and appears detached from the main section.  Without a filter, a faint star and ionizing source (DD 13, an unresolved pair of O-stars) is located at the center of the glow.


NGC 2079 is collinear with two mag 12 stars 1.7' N (at the center of 2078) and another mag 12 star 3.5' N. The main section of the complex to the northeast forms a large "S" shaped group of multiple knots with NGC 2078 1.7' N, 2084 to the east and 2083 to the NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2079 = h2949 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "The most southern of a group of 4 or 5 nebulae, 5' diameter, mixed with stars.  This is the south preceding of the four chief nuclei [NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and 2084] of the complex group of Plate III, figure 4". Herschel's sketch shows a complex object with 7 condensations or nuclei involved in nebulosity with the NGC 2079 at the upper right corner in the detailed sketch.


James Dunlop discovered the entire complex earlier in 1826 and described D 152 as "a cluster of six or seven small nebulae, forming a square figure 5' or 6' diameter, with several minute stars mixt. This is a very pretty group of nebulae - see Figure 5."  Dunlop's sketch with 6 or 7 patches within a group of stars appears to show this complex though his position is offset 15' too far SE.  Since NGC 2079 is one of the brightest sections, Dunlop should probably be credited with the discovery.


Annie Jump Canon established the emission spectrum of NGC 2079 in 1897 during her spectroscopic survey at Arequipa for the Henry Draper catalogue. It was independently found by Delisle Stewart around the same time.

NGC 2080 = LMC-N160A = ESO 057-12 = S-L 641 = Ghost Head Nebula

05 39 44.6 -69 38 45; Dor

V = 10.4;  Size 1.5'


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x and UHC filter, this emission nebula is very impressive, appearing as an extremely bright nebulous glow with an irregular shape, ~1.5' diameter, slightly elongated.  The brightest section is encased in a larger, fainter nebulous glow that extends mostly to the south.  NGC 2077, a bright HII glow, is attached on the SW side with their centers just 1' apart.  Located just 30' SSE of the center of the Tarantula Nebula!


Along with NGC 2085 and 2086, another pair of knots ~3' SE, the entire complex is part of the Superbubble LMC-N160.  Roughly 6' S is LMC-N159, another stunning group of nebulous glows consisting of NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and 2084.  NGC 2080 is the brightest region in the LMC-N159/160 complex and is nicknamed the "Ghost-Head Nebula" from a 2000 HST image.


At 350x the view was fascinating with 3 or 4 embedded "stars" (the brightest one or two appeared to be quasi-stellar knots) and NGC 2080 had a curdled texture.  A couple of brighter mag 13/14 stars are off the NW side and a number of stars trail off to the east and NE (part of the O-association LH 103).


The two "eyes" of the Ghost Head (noted as quasi-stellar above) are rare, compact "high excitation blobs" (HEBs) of diameter ~3".  They were discovered in 1986 and identified as A1 and A2, separated by ~20".


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2080 = D 145 or D 150 in 1826 and described D 145 as "the centre of a large cluster of extremely minute stars, with many very small nebulae in it."  Dunlop's position falls just southwest of the NGC 2077/2080/2085/2086 association and just northwest of the NGC 2078/2079/2083 association, so he certainly observed several of these components and NGC 2080 is perhaps the brightest individual section.  D 150 was recorded as "A well-defined round nebula, small.  This precedes a group of nebulae."  There is nothing at his position but NGC 2080 is 14' NW and it is on the west side of the complex, so fits the description.


John Herschel observed NGC 2080 = h2947 in Dec 1834 and logged "B; R; double; the other sp [NGC 2077] is F; R; followed by clustering stars."   An excellent sketch of the entire complex is on plate III, figure 4.

05 40 00 -69 24 24; Dor

V = 9.9;  Size 6'x3.5'


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 214x, this is a gorgeous star cloud consisting of two dozen stars in a 5' region (stellar association LH 104, which is dominated by B-class supergiants), including many mag 13-14 stars as well as mag 12.2 star HD 38489 (an extreme luminous blue variable!) on the northeast side.  On the east side of the central grouping is HD 38472, a mag 13.2 Wolf-Rayet (Brey 95) and on the west side is HD 38448, a mag 13.0 Wolf-Rayet (Brey 94).


Adding a UHC filter enhances a fairly bright HII glow that nearly surrounds the entire cluster in a triangular wreath (weak in the center)!  The brightest portion is a ribbon with a bright region (identified in SIMBAD as BSDL 2722) at one end just south of the cluster and extending due east.  With closer inspection BSDL 2722 actually consists of a couple of knots and fainter streaks intersecting!  Just beyond the east end of this ribbon is NGC 2091, a slightly elongated cluster that is collinear with the streamer.  HDE 269936 a mag 11 "star" (an extremely compact cluster) is just off the SW side. NGC 2074, a bright HII region and cluster (part of the same complex LMC-N158), lies 8' SW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2081 = h2951 in 1834-1835 (exact sweep or date unknown as based on a detailed sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) region made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835) and simply noted in the CGH catalogue as a "Cluster VI of vF stars and nebula.  See Catalogue of Nubecula Major."  His coordinates and placement on his chart of the LMC matches this association.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2082 = h2945 on 30 Nov 1834 and recorded "pF, L, R, vlbM, 2'."  On a later sweep he added "B, L, R, glbM, 90", has a *10m 2' dist 25° south-following."  His position and decsription matches ESO 086-021 = PGC 17609.

05 39 58.8 -69 44 10; Dor

V = 10.8;  Size 1.5'


25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): NGC 2083 is the main northern section and the largest piece of the NGC 2078/79/83/84 complex (LMC-N159 and OB-association LH 105).  At 244x and NPB filter it appeared bright, large, nearly 2' in diameter, roughly circular.  The surface brightness appeared fairly uniform, though lower at the northeast periphery where it merges with NGC 2078.  Unfiltered, a half-dozen dozen stars mag 13.5 and fainter are involved in the nebula, along with mag 12.5 RMC 149, an O8.5-type supergiant near the center.  At 397x (unfiltered), a mag 14.5 companion is 7" N of RMC 149 and the star seemed slightly "soft".


On the southeast side of NGC 2083 [44" SE of the mag 12.5 star] is N159-5, a 15th magnitude "star" known as the LMC "Papillon Nebula".  This very compact object is classified as a Young Stellar Object (YSO) and High Excitation Blob (HEB), a rare class of ionized nebulae associated with massive star formation.  At 397x it appeared faint (15th mag) and quasi-stellar (though difficult to confirm).


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 214x and UHC filter, NGC 2083 appeared as a bright, large, slightly elongated glow ~1.8' diameter, surrounding a mag 12.5 star (O-class supergiant).  A brighter knot is embedded within the glow on the west side (LMC-N159I) on a line with NGC 2078.  Removing the filter, the bright central star has a companion at ~7" and several other mag 14 stars are embedded in the periphery of the glow.


NGC 2083 is situated in the northeast section of the curving "S" shaped NGC 2078/79/83/84 complex (LMC-N159 and OB-association LH 105).  This complex shares the same field with two additional bright emission regions - NGC 2085/86 4' N and NGC 2077/80 ~5.5' NNW (LMC-N160), and the combined complex forms a superb field of bright HII regions ~35' SSE of the center of the Tarantula Nebula.  Although Herschel assigned 4 NGC numbers within LMC-N159, I logged at least 7 different brighter knots (see NGC 2084 for more).


John Herschel discovered NGC 2083 = h2952 (along with numerous other objects in this HII complex) on 23 Dec 1834  and recorded "the north following nucleus of the complex group of Plate III, figure 4, from drawing."  Herschel's excellent sketch shows a complex object with 7 condensations or nuclei, involved in nebulosity. The four NGC objects in this grouping are NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and NGC 2084.

NGC 2084 = LMC-N159C = ESO 057-15

05 40 06.9 -69 45 34; Dor

V = 11.3;  Size 1.2'


25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): NGC 2084 is the second brightest section of the striking Henize N159 complex (NGC 2078/70/83/84) on its SE side and the brightest part of N159C.  At 244x + NPB filter, it appeared very bright, fairly large, irregular shape, over 1' diameter (elongated N-S). Unfiltered two stars are involved included a mag 14.0 (O-7 type).  Fainter nebulosity extends west for 1' (also part of N159C) with a mag 14.0 O7-type and 14.5 O8-type stars involved unfiltered. The nebulosity curls north on its west side and brightens in a 40" circular patch (N159C-west) that includes two 15th mag stars (unfiltered), one a young stellar object (YSO).  Overall, N159C displays a highly irregular curving shape with a patchy surface brightness and includes a half-dozen stars.


N159E, a detached piece ~1.5' S, is a fairly faint to moderately bright patch, irregularly round, 35" diameter, even surface brightness.  Unfiltered, a star was seen involved with the nebulosity (ionizing source?).   N159G, a slightly brighter detached piece 1.1' ENE of NGC 2084, appeared moderately bright and large, roughly oval, ~45" diameter.  Unfiltered, a faint star is centered in N159G.


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This emission knot was noted while making a careful observation of NGC 2084, which is located within the southeast region of a very bright nebular complex NGC 2078-79-83-8 (LMC-N159), located ~40' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula.  At the northeast end of the NGC 2084 region I noted a moderately bright, round knot, ~45" diameter.  Without a filter a star is involved with this glow.  Although John Herschel didn't catalogued this knot, it's shown on his sketch (Plate III, figure 4).  NGC 2084, a brighter knot, is close WSW on a direct line with NGC 2079.  NGC 2084 appeared very bright, fairly large, elongated, ~1.2'x1.0'.  Removing the filter a couple of stars are involved (with one brighter star).


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I returned to this detailed nebula the following night to make a complete observation at 200x using a UHC filter.  NGC 2084 forms the SE region of the complex and it's composed of several nearby components.  At the NE end of this extended region is a moderately bright, round knot, ~45" diameter (N159G).  Without a filter a star is involved with N159G (sketched by John Herschel but not catalogued).  A second, brighter embedded "glow" is close WSW on a direct line with NGC 2079.  This knot corresponds with John Herschel's position for NGC 2084 and is catalogued as N159C-east.  It appeared very bright, fairly large, elongated, ~1.2'x1.0'.  Removing the filter a couple of stars are involved (with one brighter star).  Finally, N159C-west (also sketched by Herschel but not cataloged) lies 1.5' W of N159C-east in the center of the entire complex and is connected to N159C-west by a faint bridge of nebulosity.  N159C-west appeared fairly bright, moderately large, round, 45" diameter.


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the SE component of a fascinating 4' HII complex filled with up to 8 distinguishable knots (4 have NGC numbers) with several of the brighter knots forming an "S" shape (this knot is at SE end of the "S").  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared very bright, round, fairly large glow, 1' diameter and encased within fainter nebulous haze that extends to the west.  NGC 2083 lies 1.5' NNW within the background glow that envelopes the entire complex.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2084 = h2953 in Dec 1834 and described as "The south following nucleus of the complex group of Plate III fig 4, from drawing."  Herschel's sketch shows 7 condensations or nuclei, involved in nebulosity. The four NGC objects in this grouping are NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and NGC 2084. The complex was discovered earlier by James Dunlop on 24 Sep 1826 and D 149 was recorded as "a faint round nebula, about 1' diameter".   His description could apply to NGC 2084 or one of the others in the nebulous group.  His position was ~5' too far east.

V = 12.1;  Size 0.7'


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this HII knot is part of an amazing field of nebulous glows located ~35' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula.  At 200x using a UHC filter, NGC 2085 appears bright, fairly small, ~25" diameter. A mag 10.0 star (supergiant HDE 269953) is just off the NE end (23" from the center).  NGC 2085 forms a close pair with NGC 2086 = IC 2145, a similar knot just 1.2' E.  Both of these knots are immersed in small, much fainter nebulous halos but the bright star itself does not appear to be involved.  Viewing with the filter, the field is divided up into three main groups with NGC 2085 and 2086 forming a close E-W pair separated by a mag 10 star.  NGC 2080 (brightest section in the LMC-N159/160 complex) and NGC 2077 lies ~2.5' NW and an impressive cluster of nebulous knots (NGC 2078, 2079, 2083 and 84) is roughly 6' SSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2085 = h2954 on 23 Dec 1834 and reported "a very faint, nearly round nebula close to a star 10th mag, not observed in sweeping, but laid down Dec 4, 1873 in the drawing fig 4, Plate III whence its place is derived."  The identification is certain based on his sketch.

V = 12.0;  Size 0.7'


24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the eastern component of a close pair of nebulous glows with NGC 2085 just 1.2' W.  This pair is part of a fascinating group of numerous emission nebulae (LMC-N160 and LMC-N159) just 35' S of the Tarantula nebula.  At 200x with a UHC filter, this knot appears very bright (slightly brighter than NGC 2085), fairly small, round, ~30" diameter.  Without a filter, a faint star is near the center.  Mag 10 supergiant HD 269953 (misidentified as NGC 2086 in the ESO catalogue), which is nearly attached to the NE side of NGC 2085, lies 1' W.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2086 = h2956 in Dec 1834 and recorded "B, pS, R, lbM, follows a star 10m with other S stars about it.  Not observed in sweeping, but laid down in the drawing of Dec 4, 1837, whence its place is derived from the drawing fig 4, Pl III.  JH's position and sketch clearly shows that NGC 2086 follows the mag 10 star and corresponds with a nebulous patch 12 seconds of RA following the bright star.


Williamina Fleming discovered the emission spectrum of this nebula again on an objective prism plate taken in 1901 at Arequipa. As she didn't associate it with the NGC number, Dreyer catalogued Fleming 92 (Harvard discovery number) as IC 2145.  ESO, Harold Corwin and Mati Morel misidentified NGC 2086 with the mag 10 star.  After Corwin was notified he corrected his identification of NGC 2086.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2088 = h2955 on 9 Feb 1836 and recorded "eF; S; R; insulated."  His mean position (2 sweeps) of 05 40 56.4 -68 27 54 (2000) was used by Dreyer in the NGC.  The declination given in RNGC, NGC 2000 and UGC 2000 (first edition) is exactly 1 degree too far south.  This error originated in Shapley and Lindsay's "A Catalogue of Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud", Irish Astronomical Journal, v. 6, pp. 74-91, 1963.  The declination should have been -68° 29' instead of -69° 29'.  The error was noted by Hodge and Wright in their LMC Atlas.  The ESO and Kontizas position is correct.

17.5" (12/3/88): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, bright core, stellar nucleus.  Collinear with a mag 11 star 1.6' SSE and a mag 12 star 2.8' SSE of center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2089 = H III-270 on 6 Feb 1785 (sweep 367) and recorded "a very faint extremely small stellar nebula; 240 verified it with difficulty, and considerable attention, the night being uncommonly clear."  JH did not make an observation but the NGC position matches ESO 554-036  = PGC 17860.  Auwers reduced RA is 1 hr too large.

13.1" (2/25/84): faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 ~N-S, 2.5'x0.8'.  A mag 13.5 star is at the north tip 1.5' from center, a mag 14 star is at the west edge, 40" from center and another 14th mag star is 1.2' SE.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2090 = D 594 = h2944 on 29 Oct 1826 and described "a small faint nebula, with a ray shooting out on the north side."  Dunlop observed this galaxy once and his position is 3' too far SSW.  The "ray" he mentions probably consists of 3 mag 13-14 stars.  John Herschel recorded the galaxy twice, on 8 Jan 1836 recording a "globular cluster, B; R; with an appendage to northward; 2.5' diameter." The following night he described it as "B, irreg R, gbM; 3' long; 2' broad with stars appended. This RA to be preferred".  Herschel called this galaxy a globular in the GC and Dreyer copied that classification in the NGC description.

V = 12.0;  Size 1.0'


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I accidentally picked up this cluster while examining the beautiful star cloud/nebula NGC 2081 to the NW.  A bright E-W ribbon is on the south side of NGC 2081 with its vertex (brighter and larger end of the streamer) closest to NGC 2074 (to the SW) and extending towards the east.  Just beyond the east end of this ribbon I picked up this elongated glow that appeared collinear with the streamer.  At 214x without a filter, the 35"x25" knot partially resolved into a number of fainter stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2091 = h2957 in 1834-1835 (exact sweep or date unknown as based on a detailed sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) region made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835) and recorded as "vF; S; mE; glbM; 1' l; perhaps a vF double neb.  See Catalogue of the Nubecula Major."  Since no sweep is given in his LMC catalogue, the discovery date is unknown.  His position is ~1' SSW of this cluster.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very faint round knot, ~40" diameter with a brighter core.  Located 4' W of NGC 2100 and 17' SE of the center of the Tarantula.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2092 = h2962 in 1834-1835 (exact sweep or date unknown as based on a detailed sketch of the Tarantula Nebula (NGC 2070) region made over several nights in Nov 1834 and Dec 1835) and recorded a "cluster class 6. vF, R, 60", partially resolved. See Catalogue of the Nubecula Major".  The CGH position (based on the sketch) is 1.3' east of this cluster (and just west of NGC 2100).


Eric Lindsay, in the 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289), notes "This may be the star-rich region just W of NGC 2100. Position deduced by Herschel from a drawing and not made in a sweep. Listed as N[ebula] in Nubec. Cat and Cl in general Cat.  Description does not agree with anything here."

05 41 50 -68 55 18; Dor

V = 11.6;  Size 1.5'


14" (4/3/16 - Coonabarabran, 178x):  this stellar association (LH 109) is located just 20' NE of the center of the Tarantula Nebula and less than 1' SSE of a mag 7.2 star (HD 38617).  It appeared as a fairly bright, fairly large mottled glow, roughly 1.7' in diameter. A mag 11.7 star is at the west edge.  Several faint stars are resolved around the edges, including ones at the north, northeast and south side.  A mag 9.4 star (HD 38654) is 3' NW and a mag 9.4 star (HD 269975) is 6' WSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2093 = h2963 on on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded "vF, S, R. This nebula forms an appendage to the skirts of the great looped nebula 30 Doradus, which hang down in visible fringes from the upper (southern) part of the field."  His position is accurate.  Herschel gave a possible equivalence with D 184, which James Dunlop discovered in 1826 and described as "a very small round nebula, about 8" diameter."  Dunlop's position is 9' due west of the cluster.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2094 = h2959 on 31 Jan 1835 and noted "vF; S; R; 12"."  Herschel made a single observation and his position is an excellent match with KMHK 1251.  The Hodge-Wright LMC Atlas misidentifies ESO 57-SC26 as NGC 2094.  This cluster is situated 33' south (and just following NGC 2093).  ESO and NED followed this misidentification.  Archinal and Hynes correctly identify NGC 2094 = KMHK 1251.

05 42 51 -67 19 18; Dor

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): Although Herschel described a large "oblong cluster", the brightest subgroup is at the east end (S-L 669).  It appeared as a bright, moderately large patch, irregular, 1' diameter, with several mag 13.5-14 stars resolved around the edges.  A separate patch lies 1.3' W with a mag 11 star 2.2' W.  A group of stars (KMHK 1253) is 1' NW of the brighter star.  The entire collection forms the stellar association LH 112, a 3'x1.5' group of resolved stars highlighted by S-L 669.  Located 8' NE of mag 7.0 HD 38616.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2095 = h2961 on 20 Dec 1835 and described "a star 9m, chief of a F irreg oblong cluster 3' in extent."  His position, measured on 3 sweeps, is fairly accurate.

30" (10/14/15 - OzSky): bright, compact LMC cluster, ~25".  A close double star is resolved at the center, along with two other bright mag 13 stars and a couple of additional mag 15+ stars.  A mag 11.8 star is off the west side [40" from center].  Mag 9.6 HD 270036 lies 3.5' NE.  Nearby is NGC 2088 7' W, NGC 2094 6' N and NGC 2098 11' NNE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2096 = h(725) between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and listed it as#725 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  His position is 1.7' too far south.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 303x and 394x; fairly faint , moderately large, 45" glow with a mag 14 star involved on the south side.  The slightly brighter core of the cluster is very close northeast of the star, but the cluster was unresolved.  The field includes a mag 13 star 2' SSE, two mag 11/12.5 stars 3.5' ENE and a group of mag 13-15 stars ~3' NW.  Located 17.5' NE of mag 6.9 HD 38511.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2097 = h2960 on 26 Dec 1834 and described as "F, irregularly round, psbM, sf a small group." On a second sweep he called it "eF, S, R; has a star 16th mag in centre." His last observation was recorded as "pF, R, pslbM, 50"."

NGC 2098 = ESO 057-028 = S-L 667

05 42 30 -68 16 30; Dor

V = 10.7;  Size 1.6'


30" (10/14/15 - OzSky):  extremely bright LMC cluster, ~1' diameter.  Contains a very bright, nebulous core.  The halo is largely resolved and includes two or three bright stars; a mag 13 star is at the east edge, a mag 13-13.5 star is at the north edge and a mag 13.5 star is at the south edge.  In addition another 10 stars are resolved in the cluster.  Several clusters are to the south: NGC 2094 5.8' SSW, NGC 2096 11' S, NGC 2088 14' SW as well as S-L 666 6' NNW.  The S-L cluster surrounds a mag 13 star and a half-dozen mag 15/16 stars are resolved in a 40" halo.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2098 = h2965 on 31 Jan 1835 and recorded "B; S clustering group or globular cluster; 30", stars visible."  On a second sweep he logged it as "a small close knot or cluster, 40"."  JH gave a very uncertain (??) equivalence with D 185.  Dunlop's description reads "a small faint round nebula, preceding a minute double star of the 12th magnitude.  Another similar nebula follows, about 20" in RA, and 2' south in a line with the double star."  His position is nearly 13' due E of this cluster, though there is no "similar nebula" that follows, so this identification is very suspect.

8": very large, very rich cluster, over 150 stars, rich in mag 10-13 stars.  A reddish star, HD 39183, is near the center.  Best of the three bright Messier open clusters in Auriga and one of the top open clusters in the sky.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered M37 = NGC 2099 = h369 in 1654.  Charles Messier independently discovered the cluster on 2 Sept 1764 and reported a "cluster of small stars, not far from the preceding [M36], on the parallel of Chi Aurigae; the stars are very small, very crowded and containing nebulosity; it is difficult to see the stars with an ordinary telescope of 3 feet and a half."   On 4 Nov 1782, William Herschel recorded "Is an astonishing number of small stars with 227; they are almost all of the 2nd or 3rd class. I see no kind of nebulosity in the spot. With 460 the whole is resolvable into stars without nebulosity."

05 42 08.0 -69 12 44; Dor

V = 9.6;  Size 2'


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster appears as a small, bright (V = 9.6) clump of stars and unresolved haze with a diameter of ~2'.  Fairly compact and isolated with at least 10 mag 12 and fainter stars resolved.  Located 20' ESE of the core of the Tarantula nebula within the LMC OB-association LH 111.  On the DSS, this appears to be a very rich open cluster or globular within a larger association.  NGC 2092 lies 4' WSW and NGC 2108 is 10' ENE.


James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 2100 = D 154? on 25 Sep 1826 and reported "a pretty bright round or rather elliptical nebula, 25" diameter."  His position is 5.6' ESE of the cluster, well within his typical errors.  Glen Cozens assigns D 151 to NGC 2100.  Dunlop described this entry as "a faint ill-defined small nebula" and the position is just 2.5' NW of the cluster.  Finally, JH also suggest that D 147 might be an equivalence.  This entry is 8.4' WSW of the cluster and the description reads "a pretty bright round or rather oval nebula, 30" diameter."  This description is very similar to the one for D 154.


On his first sweep of 3 Nov 1834, JH described NGC 2100 = h2966 as "a bright S cluster of distinct stars (thick haze)."  On a second sweep he wrote "the cluster sf the great looped nebula." On a third occasion he called it "globular cluster, irr R, psmbM, 2'."  His 4th sweep reads "globular, B, R, 3', all resolved into stars 13..16th mag."  His final record states "B, S, m compressed, not mbM; irregular oval, 3', stars distinct 13th mag." He noted it might be equivalent to Dunlop 154, 151? or 154??

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 166x, this disturbed, chaotic galaxy appeared extremely faint, very small, round, 15" diameter. The galaxy is collinear with a string of three mag 10-11 stars to the southwest (closest star is 3.6' SW) and mag 14 stars are close south and ESE.  Located 22' SSW of NGC 2104.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2101 = h2958 on 9 Jan 1837 and recorded "eF, R, 40", a line of three stars, 10th mag to south, points nearly to it."  His position and description is accurate, though the stars are southwest.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): at 394x; bright, small, mottled glow, 24" diameter. A half-dozen tightly packed stars are resolved including an easy mag 12.9 star at the south edge.  Located 17' E of the excellent NGC 2074 nebulous cluster and 15' SE of showpiece NGC 2081, both of which lie ~20' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula!


John Herschel discovered NGC 2102 between Nov 1836 and Mar 1837 with a 5-inch refractor and recorded it as#730 in his preliminary catalogue of "Stars, Nebulae and Clusters in the Nubecula Major."  His position is 0.9' SSW of this cluster.

05 41 40 -71 19 56; Men

V = 10.8;  Size 3'x2'


25" (10/17/17 - OzSky): at 244x unfiltered; fairly bright, very large, roundish glow surrounding a central star (12.7-magnitude O2-type Sk -71°51) with a bright quasi-stellar knot at the north edge (0.9' N of the central star).  Increasing the magnification to 397x, ~8 total stars are involved.  The nebula was clearly elongated NNW-SSE (tapering on the SSE end) and brighter along a central spine.  The addition of a NPB filter at 244x produced an excellent contrast gain; the nebula appeared very bright with an irregular surface brightness and the small knot at the north edge (a high excitation HII blob or HEB) was a prominent feature.


Note: The central "star" was resolved by the HST into a compact cluster of at least 6 components in a 4" region!  The HEB is a small dense region ("only" 4 to 9 light-years wide), representing an "early stage of massive stars (O-type) emerging from their embryonic molecular clouds."


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster and emission nebula appeared as a bright, very large oval glow, ~3'x2'.  Excellent response to a UHC filter at 200x and with this combination the nebulosity has a very high surface brightness.  Five stars down to 15th magnitude are involved unfiltered with mag 12.7-magnitude Sk -71°51, an unusually hot and intrinsically bright star (O2-class), at the center.  The cluster is the O-association LH 110.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): at 394x; very bright, large, irregular, mottled, partially resolved, 50"x30" E-W.  Slightly brighter stars are at the east and west end, and several additional mag 16 stars are resolved.  A mag 11.5 star is 2' SE and cluster H-S 408 was picked up 5.5' SE.  It appeared as a moderately to fairly bright glow, elongated NW-SE, 0.6'x0.2', mottled but unresolved.  The mag 11.5 star is roughly midway between H-S 408 and NGC 2105.  The HII complex LHa 120-N74 lies 15' SSE (western part) and 20' SE (eastern part).


LHa 120-N74 (west): at 152x + NPB filter; excellent HII region!  Bright, very large, elongated E-W, very irregular shape, ~7'x4', the main section tapers on the eastern end and spreads out on the western end.  Numerous mag 14 stars are involved as well as mag 10.2 HD 270111 on the south side.  LHa 120-N74 (East) lies ~9' ESE, with the two regions spanning nearly 15' E-W.


LHa 120-N74 (east): at 152x + NPB filter; bright, very large nebulous region.  The main piece is oval 3:2 E-W, ~2'x1.4' and brighter along the rim.  A filament is attached on the south side extending to the southeast!  Unfiltered a number of stars are involved with the nebulosity.  A mag 11.2 star is roughly 3' S.  LHa 120-N74 W is ~9' W.  Although this is very likely part of the same complex, the two sections did not appear connected.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2105 = h2969 on 2 Jan 1837 and logged "vF; R; 30".  The obs in RA is marked as uncertain."  On the very next night he observed the cluster again and reported "F; R; gbM; 80".  His (mean) position matches ESO 86-SC29.  The RNGC and NGC 2000.0 declination is 30' too far north.  This positional error originated from a misprint in the Shapley-Lindsay catalogues for S-L 687 = NGC 2105.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2110 = H III-448 = H III-450 = h370 (equivalence noted by Albert Marth in AN 995) on 5 Oct 1785 (sweep 458) and recorded III-450 as "eF, vS, 240 confirmed it."  His summary description from three observations reads, "vF, S, R, resolvable, lbM."  He also found it on 24 Feb 1786 (sweep 529) and logged "eF, E, er.  Is probably a patch."  Because of the differing descriptions, WH assumed it was new, and catalogued it again as III-510.  On 8 Jan 1831 (sweep 318), John Herschel logged, "vF; R; psbM." and combined the two H-designations in the GC.  The declination given in the RNGC is 10' too far north.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): bright, fairly large elongated glow, knotty, 1' diameter.  This nebulous cluster has an unusual structure; a small bright elongated knot is on the east end (N168A) and a second small, fairly bright, elongated knot is adjacent on the west side (N168B).  Strong response to an NPB filter and a much larger nebulous hazy glow extends to the west, increasing the size to 1.5'.  The high surface brightness elongated pieces lie on the east end.  Located 30' E of the NGC 2078/79/83/84 complex.


Emission nebula LHa 120-N163 lies 12' W and appeared as a bright, large, irregular glow, ~3' diameter.  Several stars are involved with the nebulosity, including a mag 13 star on the north side and a couple of additional mag 13.5 stars (H-S 400).  Excellent response to the NPB filter at 152x and 303x.  The glow is clearly brighter in an arc (opening towards the northwest) on the southeast end.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2113 = h2975 on 3 Nov 1834 and recorded (first of 5 observations) "F (?) L, R; thick haze." The next observation was recorded as "a pB cluster nebula 90"." On a third occasion he noted "F cluster, irreg fig; gbM; 2'; resolved." The fourth observation was recorded as "F, irreg fig; resolvable; one star seen; 90"." The final observation was recorded as "irregular oval cluster; vF; 2' diameter; vl compressed to the middle; almost nebulous. Stars = 16th mag."  JH noted the equivalence with Dunlop 155, although it is not given by Steinicke.


James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 2113 = D 155? in 1826 and described "a very faint elliptical nebula, about 50" diameter, slightly bright to the center."

William Herschel discovered NGC 2139 = H II-264 on 17 Nov 1784 (sweep 322) and called it "F, S."  He added "The RA cannot be above 10 or 15 sec out; the roller went off the apparantus which occasions the uncertainty."  This was the only nebula found in the sweep.


Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy from Southern California on 1 Dec 1897 and reported it in discovery list XI-90 (later IC 2154). Swift's position was off by 14 sec in RA and Herbert Howe measured an accurate position (used in the IC).  In the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues Dreyer comments that once a correction is made to WH's position (based on another star in the sweep), NGC 2139 matches IC 2154. MCG labels this galaxy as IC 2154 and ignores the NGC designation.  See Corwin's notes for more.

E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 2141 in Jan 1883 with his 5-inch refractor.  His announcement note in Sidereal Messenger, Vol 3, p9 titled "A New and Faint Nebulosity" gives an accurate position and describes a "very faint nebulosity. It lies a little over 3/4° north of Mu Orionis, and requires a low power to be seen at all. With my 5-inch refractor and a power of 30, it is quite distinct; but high powers diffuse it greatly. There is a faint star in its center, and several others on its border, about 2' diameter. I have repeatedly seen this nebula since January 1883."

There are other similar cases where Herschel made the same error: NGC 771 = 50 Cas, NGC 4530 = Beta CVn and NGC 2542 = h3115 (see comments on NGC 4530).  On 30 Nov 1850, Lord Rosse noted, "Same appearance as epsilon Orionis [N1990], but v[ery] m[uch] fainter".  In 1868, his son Lawrence recorded, "appears nebulous..."  Corwin notes, however, that on the red POSS1 there is a very faint extended nebulosity surrounding 3 Mon, so perhaps Herschel did pick something up.

48" (10/29/16): at 488x, the "Dusty Hand" galaxy has an unusual, highly disrupted appearance.   The very bright core is large and elongated NW-SE with a small, intense nucleus.  A prominent, fairly wide dust lane slices through the center with the brightest part of the core roughly parallel on the north side. A small portion of the core is on the south side of the lane.  These features give rise to the "Dusty Hand" nickname.   On the southeast side a fairly prominent "arm" or plume (part of a merged companion?) extends generally east beyond a mag 14.5 star 2' ESE of center.  The halo is very diffuse to the north of this arm.  At the northwest end of the a galaxy a very faint "arm" curls sharply clockwise and with careful viewing a very low surface brightness plume (detached from the central portion) extends south on the west side.  On deep images these arms and plumes seem to be a single tidal structure or stream that wraps around the galaxy.


24" (12/28/13): this highly distorted galaxy was observed at 260x.  The galaxy appeared very bright, very large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, ~5'x2', with a very asymmetric structure.  It contains a very bright, elongated core, ~1.2'x0.5' NW-SE, but with no distinct nucleus.  A low contrast dust lane cuts through the core unevenly, with the main section on the north side, so the lane initially appears to run parallel to the core on the southwest side.  But a fainter, elongated section of the core extending NW-SE is just beyond the dust lane on the southwest side.  To the southeast of the core, the outer halo is diffuse, with a low surface brightness and is not aligned with the major axis of the core, extending more towards the east.  On the NW side of the core, the halo has a higher and irregular surface brightness with a slightly brighter curving arc (arm) along its eastern side.


13.1" (1/18/85): fairly bright, fairly large, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, bright core.  A mag 11 double at 30" separation is just off the SE end.  A few brighter mag 10-11 stars are 6' E.  NGC 2146A lies 19' ENE.


Friedrich August Winnecke discovered NGC 2146 = T 1-18 in 1876 using a 6.5-inch comet seeker at the Strasbourg Observatory. It was independently discovered by Wilhelm Tempel the same year and by Johann Palisa (AN 2732).  This is one of 3 galaxies discovered by Winnecke, along with NGC 2276 and NGC 4760.  In 1920, based on a photograph taken with the Mt. Wilson 60", Francis Pease described "the nucleus lies a little S of the center of this mass; the nebulosity is brightest around the nucleus.  Superimposed on this bright mass is a dark marking in the form of a hand, with four talon-like figers stretching south-preceding and with three stars standing out upon it."  This must be the source of the nickname "Dusty Hand Galaxy".


As there is no candidate for a previous interaction (creating the disrupted appearance and nuclear starburst), it has been proposed that NGC 2146 is a far-evolved merger.

A shallow arc of 3 mag 13/13.9/14.2 stars lies 2' SE.  Just north of these is a small group of resolved mag 15-15.5 stars.  The collection is catalogued as S-L 785 and is part of association LH 122.  The red DSS shows a thick wreath of faint nebulosity nearly enclosing S-L 785, but I didn't notice it, at least without a filter.  NGC 2160 lird 15' ESE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2147 = h2997 on 30 Jan 1835 and logged "vF; R; bM; 30"."  On a second sweep he also noted "connected with stars, etc."  The "stars" probably refers to S-L 785.


NGC 2147 was possibly discovered by James Dunlop on 27 Sep 1826 with his 9" reflector.  He described D 191 as "a pretty bright round nebula, 40" diameter".  His position is 12' west of the cluster, a typical error.  Also D 190, described as "two very small faint nebulae" is roughly at the same position, so could also apply to this object.  Herschel didn't reference these possible earlier discoveries by Dunlop and neither does Glen Cozens.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2156 = h3005 on 23 Nov 1834 and recorded "pF; S; irreg R; psbM; 25".  He observed this cluster on 5 sweeps and other than brightness, the descriptions are similar.


James Dunlop possibly made the first observation (D 197) on 27 Sep 1826 and noted a "small faint round nebula".  His position, though, while correct in declination is nearly 19' too far east and might also apply to NGC 2172, which is 12' SW of his position.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 2157 = D 161 on 6 Nov 1826 with his 9" speculum reflector and described "a small faint nebula, 15" diameter; a small star near the north preceding edge."  Dunlop made a single observation and his position is 6.8' too far SW.  Despite the small size estimate, there is a mag 11 star off the NW edge.


John Herschel recorded this cluster (h3006) on 4 sweeps, first recording  "vB, R, gbM, 30"."  On a second sweep he logged "globular cluster, vB, R, vgvmbM, resolvable." JH noted a very uncertain (??) identification with D 161.


Pietro Baracchi logged this object on 3 Jan 1886 with the 48" Melbourne telescope as "Cl; vB; R; gpmbM; Diam 55"." His sketch shows two resolved stars (marked as 17th mag) just off the SE side.

18" (2/24/06): at 323x, this rich, irregularly shaped cluster is beautifully resolved into 45-50 stars that are peppered over a 5' background glow.  Appears like a resolved globular of low concentration class. Includes a couple of dozen mag 13.5-14.5 stars along with a rich carpet of fainter mag 15 stars.  There are several close pairs (1"-2" and possibly closer) and the number of stars keep increasing in moments of rock steady seeing as they seem to emerge from the background.  A single brighter star is at the east edge.


17.5" (2/8/86): 30-35 stars resolved, unusually rich, compact, about 5' diameter.  The appearance is similar to a resolved globular cluster.  Located 30' SW of M35.


13.1" (2/16/85): at least 20-25 stars resolved at 415x.


13.1" (11/5/83): ~15-20 stars, mottled clump near SE edge.


8" (11/5/83): few stars resolved over haze.


13x80mm (1/20/07): visible in the finder as a very faint, small glow about a half-degree SW of M35.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2158 = H VI-17 = h375 on 16 Nov 1784 (sweep 317), immediately after discovering NGC 2129.  He logged "a very compressed cluster of vS stars, very rich."   On 24 Feb 1827 (sweep 59), John Herschel described the cluster as "rich; much compressed almost to nebulosity; stars very small; irregular triangular figure."


NGC 2158 was classified as a globular by Rosino in 1954 (Contr. Padova in Asagio No. 52), Helen Sawyer Hogg, 1959 (Star Clusters) and more recently in the RNGC due to its richness.  Nevertheless, it is considered an intermediate age open cluster (~ 1 billion years old).  NGC 2158 is also five or six times as distant as M35, as far as 16,000 light years away (5071 parsecs).

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this cluster appeared bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, 0.9'x0.7'.  A brighter star is at the north edge.  At 350x, at least three additional faint stars are resolved on the north side and the appearance is asymmetric as the cluster is brighter on the north side.  Located 8' SW of NGC 2164 and 10' S of NGC 2156.  NGC 2172 lies 11' ESE, NGC 2140 is 20' WNW and S-L 791 is 6' W.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2159 = D 193 on 6 Nov 1826 and recorded "pB; R; well-defined, 12"."  He made a single obervation and his position is just 3' S of this cluster.


John Herschel observed the cluster (h3007) on 4 sweeps, first reporting on 23 Nov 1834, "pF; S; irreg R; psbM; 25"."  Next he logged it as "pF; S; R; the second of three [with NGC 2156 and 2164]."  On the third sweep he logged "pB; S; R; has a *15m close to the edge, nf".  Herschel attributed Dunlop with the discovery.


Pietro Baracchi observed the cluster on 3 Jan 1886 with the 48" Melbourne telescope and wrote, "pB; S; R; mottled.  I believe that there are at the least several stars in it."  He indicated two stars on his diagram on the NNW (mag 15) and WNW (mag 16) edge of the object.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): at 394x; bright, small cluster, 25"-30" diameter.  Three stars are resolved in the small central clump including a mag 13.5 star on the northwest edge.  Two fainter stars are on the east side and just south of center.  NGC 2156 lies 10' SSW, NGC 2164 is 14' SSE, NGC 2147/S-L 785 is 15' WNW and S-L 822 is 22' ESE.  The last cluster appeared as a moderately bright, small round glow.  A mag 13.5 star is involved at the north edge.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2160 = h3008 on 30 Dec 1836 and recorded as "pF; R; gbM; 30"."  His position from a single observation is accurate.  James Dunlop's D 195 possibly is an earlier discovery, but the cluster is too faint to be described as "a small pretty bright round nebula, 10" or 12" diameter."  His position is 10.6' NE of the cluster.


Pietro Baracchi observed this cluster on 3 Jan 1886 with the 48" Melbourne telescope and wrote "curious object; a small nebula a little elongated with a star 15m involved or attached to its n.p. (NW) end."  He also indicated a 16th mag star barely off the east edge.

14" (4/3/16 - Coonabarabran, 178x): this outlying LMC globular appeared moderately bright, fairly large, slightly elongated, nearly 1' diameter, weak concentration, no resolution. It seemed the cluster was slightly brighter along a central spine oriented WSW-ENE (probably due to slightly brighter unresolved stars).


S-L 804 was picked up 13' NE as a faint, relatively large glow, round, ~50" diameter, low even surface brightness.  A mag 10.6 star is 6' SW.

S-L 828, located 28' ENE, is fairly faint, fairly small, round, ~35" diameter, smooth surface brightness, no resolution.  Two mag 13-14 stars lie 2' SW.

S-L 783, located 16' SSW, is very faint, fairly small, round, 30" diameter, smooth glow, fairly low surface brightness, no resolution.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2161 = h3013 on 8 Feb 1836 and described as "F; pL; R; gpmbM; 2'."  His position from a single sweep is about 30" NW of center.  Located outside the boundaries of the Hodge-Wright LMC Atlas.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): at 394x; fairly bright, very large, round, contains a relatively large brighter core, mottled.  A couple of very faint stars were fairly easily resolved and several more popped in and out with averted vision.  Located 4' W of mag 8.5 HD 41515.  Three additional mag 11.5-12 stars, forming a distinctive group, extend south-southwest from the bright star.  This LMC globular is located in the northeast outer halo of the LMC, well outside the main outline.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2162 = h3010 on 30 Nov 1834 and recorded "vF; pL; R; vglbM; 80"."  On a second sweep he noted "F; R; glbM; 40"; a *9 mag follows in parallel, and 3 more 11 mag near."  In 1926, Robert Innes described it as a "preceding a bright star, nebula, 1' diam, 11 mag, with several stars involved, the brightest of which is in the centre."

Size 3'x2'


17.5" (1/9/98): moderately bright reflection nebula surrounding a young mag 11 star (HBC 193).  The brightest portion of the nebula is noticeably elongated N-S from the central star and 2'-3' in length tapering towards the star.  The northern extension has a slightly higher surface brightness. Located 3' W of a mag 9 star.  Observed at 220x without filtration.


17.5" (12/23/92): faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 N-S, ~2.5'x1.0', fairly high surface brightness.  A mag 11 star is at the south tip of the bright portion and a small very faint extension appears south of this star.  Located 3' W of mag 9 HD 41787.  Two mag 13 stars are 1' NE and 1' N and a mag 10 star is 5' S.  An evenly matched mag 10.5/10.5 double at 12" separation lies 8' WSW.  This reflection nebula doesn't respond to a Daystar 300 or OIII filter.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC due to an error in declination in the NGC.  Plotted as Ced 62 in U2000.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 2163 = St IX-6 on 6 Feb 1874 with the 31-inch reflector at the Marseille Observatory and recorded "eF, E, dif, *11 attached south."  He observed it again on 6 Jan 1878.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer accidentally copied the declination of NGC 1741 (Stephan's previous entry, IX-5).  Dreyer later caught and corrected his error in the IC 2 Notes/Corrections section (Dreyer added the comment "my mistake").  The correction was missed by most later cataloguers though Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions also gives the accurate position. As an example, in 1922 Edwin Hubble called it "A bright, uncatalogued nebula similar to NGC 2245" and Sven Cederblad listed it as "anonymous" object (#62).  So, both were obviously thrown off by Dreyer's mistake.  I uncovered that E.E. Barnard independently discovered it on 2 Sep 1888, though initially mistook it for Faye's Comet, which he was searching for.


Skiff recomputed Stephan's original position using precise coordinates for his offset star HD 41787 as 06 04 53.62 +18 40 08.7 (1950).  At this exact location is the reflection nebula Cederblad 62 at 06 04 53.17 +18 39 55.0 just 0.45 tsec of RA and 13".7 in declination from Stephan's original coordinates.  Besides the excellent positional match, Stephan described NGC 2163 as "elongated with *11 attached south" and visually this nebula appears to extend more prominently north of the mag 11.5 (central) star.  On the POSS, Ced 62 is an interesting bipolar nebula with two symmetrical funnel-shaped jets extending north-south from the central star.


More recently, Cederblad 62 wasn't referenced as a NGC object in the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0, Sky Atlas 2000.0 or the Sky Catalogue 2000.  The RNGC identifies this object as nonexistent and furthermore reverses the sign of the declination.  In addition, a poor RA was given for Ced 62 in Sky Catalogue 2000 and it was misplotted on the Uranometria 2000 (first edition) too far east, though the position was corrected in the second edition.  The Millenium Star Atlas labels this object Ced 62 at the wrong position.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest of four clusters in a 10' field.  At 260x it appeared very bright, large, round, sharply concentrated with an extremely bright core (appears to be a globular), the large outer halo extended to 2' diameter.  Roughly 15 stars were resolved in the halo - some of these were easily resolved 14th mag stars, while others were quite faint.  At 350x, two dozen stars were resolved and the core was very grainy. Overall, this is a very impressive cluster.  NGC 2156 lies 6.8' NW, NGC 2159 is 8' SW and NGC 2172 is 9.7' SE..


James Dunlop probably NGC 2164 = D 194 on 27 Sep 1826 and described a "A pretty large faint ill-defined nebula."  His position is just 3' SW of this cluster.  There are 3 other clusters within 9' (NGC 2156, 2159, 2172), but this is the largest and brightest.  D 193, decribed by Dunlop as "pretty bright" is south of NGC 2159, but could also apply to NGC 2164.


John Herschel observed this cluster (h3011) on 5 sweeps beginning on 23 Nov 1834, first recording, "vB, R, gmbM;  90", resolvable."  Herschel attributed Dunlop with the discovery.  In 1926, Robert Innes described this object as "a very condensed cluster of stars with outliers, 11 to 15 mags." (26-inch refractor, Union Observatory).

Nine of the stars in the group are fairly evenly distributed and similar in magnitude (10.5-11).  No concentration or dense spots and appears to be an asterism.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2165 = h376 on 12 Feb 1831 (sweep 325) and noted "a ppor cl 7' length, 3' broad; about a dozen stars 11m."   There is a very scattered group of brighter stars on the DSS at Herschel's position with the fields to the west lacking in stars.  Karl Reinmuth, using a Heidelberg plate, described a "Cl, P, 20-25 st 11...".   RNGC classifies this object as nonexistent (Type 7).

John Herschel discovered NGC 2166 = h3012 on 2 Jan 1837 and recorded "F, S, R, gbM, 15"."  His position is accurate. JH credits D 223 as the possible earlier discovery.  James Dunlop found D 223 and/or D 222 on 27 Sep 1826.  His description for D 222 reads "small round nebula preceding a small star."  There is a "small star" just following the cluster, though his position is 9' too far west.  D 223 has a relatively accurate position (1.6' N) with description "pretty bright and well-defined small round nebula."  Both objects were recorded as observed once, though I don't know if they were on the same night.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2167 = h378 on 8 Jan 1831 (sweep 318) and described "a star 7m with a p strong neb atmosphere."  His position matches mag 6.6 HD 41794 at 06 06 58.7 -06 12 25, but there is no surrounding nebulosity.  He incorrectly assumed this was his father's IV-44, which was described on 28 Nov 1786 (sweep 640) as a "star involved in milky chevelure, situated between two stars, with a 3rd star at rectangles to the former two."  There is nothing at WH's position for IV-44, though a couple of reflection nebulae are nearby, including NGC 2170 8' south and vdB 68 about 30 sec of RA following and 2' north.


Several unsuccessful attempts were made to see h378 at Birr Castle.  The GC and NGC used JH's position and description for h378, so NGC 2167 = h378 = HD 41694, and not H IV-44.


Dreyer commented that IV-44 ≠ h378 in the notes to his 1912 Scientific Papers of WH: "Occurs only in Sw. 640, 2m 0s p, 4' n of IV 38 [NGC 2182]. 'Situated between two stars with a third star at rectangles to the former.'  This cannot be h378 (as hitherto assumed), nor does the description quite fit IV 19 [NGC 2170], which does not occur in this sweep, though this star has a star 11m ssp and a vF star north and third farther off npp.  But 70s f h378 on the same parallel there is a star 11m between two others sp and nf with a third star p, forming a striking rectangular triangle [vdB 68].  If this is H's object, his RA is 33s too small."


Dreyer is proposing IV-44 = vdB 68 = Ced 65 (and Wolfgang Steinicke concurs), though Corwin feels H IV-44 is more likely a duplicate observation of NGC 2170 = H IV-19, which is brighter and 8' due south of WH's position.

18" (11/14/09): gorgeous view at 75x, which beautifully frames the cluster as well as nearby NGC 2158.  The densest portion is the central 25' where roughly 250-300 stars are resolved.  The cluster is noticeably lopsided due to a loop of stars that juts out on the SE side of the cluster. This loop includes mag 7.5 HD 42086 near its SE end.  The brightest cluster star is a double on the north side (O∑ 134 = 7.5/9.1 at 31") with a bright orange-colored primary.  A prominent loop of stars heads south and curves to the west beginning at O∑ 134.  This same chain nearly merges with another prominent chain of fainter stars that begins on the west side of the cluster and forms a string that heads east through the cluster.  Other loops and chains caught my eye as star chains seem to outline regions where there are star voids.  The cluster itself resides in a rich star field though is fairly well-detached by a region of lower star density surrounding the cluster, particularly around the south side.


8": very bright string cluster, very large, excellent field but not rich in faint stars.  Many of the stars are arrange in rows and loops.


Naked-eye: Visible as a fairly small naked-eye glow in a dark sky.


Phillippe De Chéseaux discovered M35 = NGC 2168 = h377 in 1745-46.  John Bevis independently found the cluster before 1750 (possibly earlier than De Chéseaux).  On 19 Feb 1827 (sweep 58) John Herschel described "a L, coarse, p rich cl of st 9...16m, which fills 2 or 3 fields, but cheifly one in which are about 100 stars."

The stars are divided into two main subgroups - along the west side is a string of six stars aligned N-S in a very shallow "V" asterism.  The northern two stars in this string form the wide double ∑844 = 8.8/9.9 at 24" and less than 2' S is mag 8.7 SAO 95271.  The eastern subgroup consists of 9 stars forming a distinctive triangle outline and includes the close double star ∑848 = 7.5/8.0 at 2.5".  The brighter stars form a fairly distinctive "37" pattern!  Located 0.9 degrees WSW of Xi Orionis.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2169 = H VIII-24 = h379 on 15 Oct 1784 (sweep 293) and recorded as "a small cluster of pretty large white stars, prettily arranged, not many of them."  On 24 Dec 1786 (sweep 662) he noted "a cl of brilliant stars, not many in number, but pretty much compressed; with a vacancy in the middle."


By analyzing William Herschel's early "reviews" of bright stars (before his systematic sweeps), which resulted in the discovery of many double stars, Wolfgang Steinicke found that Herschel first discovered the cluster on 12 Oct 1782 using his 6.2" reflector.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2170 = H IV-19 on 16 Oct 1784 (sweep 296) and recorded "a pretty large star, about the 9th magnitude, surrounded by milky nebulosity, not circular; but an irregular ellipsis."  He recorded it again on 23 Feb 1786 (sweep 528) and logged "a considerable star with milky nebulosity E in meridian or a little from np to sf.  It involves a smaller star which is about 1.5' north of it.  Other stars of equal magnitude are perfectly clear from it."  It was possibly recorded again on 28 Nov 1786 as IV-44 (sweep 640) as a "star involved in milky chevelure, situated between two stars, with a 3rd star at rectangles to the former two."

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): there are no good candidates matching Herschel's description for this number, but Mati Morel suggested NGC 2171 was possibly S-L 691 and 692 with a large error in RA (15 min of RA).  Although Corwin has since rejected this possibility as it is out of RA order in the sweep, here are the descriptions of these clusters.


S-L 691: faint or fairly faint, small, round, glow, 25" diameter.  S-L 691 is the northern of close pair of LMC clusters with S-L 692 just 48" S.  Located 5' ESE of NGC 2107.

S-L 692: fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated glow, 35" diameter, no resolution.  Visually, there is no noticeable star cloud surrounding these two clusters.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2171 = h3016 on 16 Dec 1835 and recorded "eeF; vL; R; glbM; 4'."  There is nothing at this position though ~5' NW is S-L 809 = KMHK 1571.  Eric Lindsay, in his 1964 paper "Some NGC objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud" (IAJ, 6, 286-289), notes "This may be the small object S/L 809, 0.5 min W, 2' N which may be an unresolved cluster or possibly a galaxy. The size does not agree."  SIMBAD also identifies S-L 809 as NGC 2171.  But this tiny cluster is roughly 30", so it's not a reasonable match with a 4' object.  The Hodge-Wright Atlas misidentifies a faint star as NGC 2171.


Mati Morel has proposed that h3016 is a star cloud at 05 44 14 -70 40 09, which includes S-L 691 and S-L 692.  This requires a very large error in RA (over 15 min of RA).  Harold Corwin notes that the sweep order argues against such an error (see his identification notes) and this object appears to be lost.

James Dunlop's D 197, found on 27 Sep 1826, is possibly an earlier discovery though the cluster may be too faint for him to pick up.  He described a "small faint round nebula" and his position was off by 12' to the NE.


Pietro Baracchi picked up this cluster on 3 Jan 1886 while observing the nearby clusters with the 48" Melbourne telescope and called it "a nebulous patch, small, a little elongated and faint, with two stars involved in it."  His diagram shows a third star (called 17th mag) just off the SE edge.  He labeled this cluster "(A)" and assumed it was a new discovery.

06 09 23.6 +20 39 34; Ori

Size 40'x30'


17.5" (1/16/02): at 64x and OIII filter, this is a beautiful, detailed nebulosity surrounding a mag 8 star (SAO 78049), extending at least 20' diameter.  The OIII filter gives a dramatic contrast gain.  With averted vision and careful viewing, the outer borders extend to ~25'.  Structure includes interior streaky dark lanes visible to the west of the star.  The rim is slightly brighter or has a higher contrast on the western edge but slightly more nebulosity is visible on the following side of the star.


Without a filter at 64x, I was surprised to immediately notice a moderately bright 3' round glow, situated ~11' NNW of SAO 78049 near the NW edge of the main glow.  Interestingly, this patch of nebulosity is more prominent than the main body without a filter and is probably the section of the HII complex visually discovered by Stephan!  It seemed quite strange that this patch had such a different filter response and dimmed significantly with the OIII (mainly reflection component?).  A curving arc of stars is situated along the north side of the glow.  The entire nebula is situated among a scattered group of stars, which is often mistaken for NGC 2175.  Located 1.4 degrees ENE of Chi(2) Orionis.


17.5" (2/28/87): very large, irregular nebulosity surrounding mag 8.0 SAO 78049.  Dark lanes are evident west of the star, appears very streaky.  A bright small unresolved knot is 3.2' ENE of the bright star using an OIII filter [this is NGC 2175].


13.1" (1/18/85): very bright with filter, very large, surrounds a mag 8 star, sky very dark off west side.  West of the star the nebula is mottled and streaky with a bright region near the north edge.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 2174 = St IX-7 on 6 Feb 1877.  His description doesn't refer to the entire nebula but rather a small patch of nebulosity (without the accents): "excessive., excess. faible (a peine observable); a l'interieur d'un triangle forme par trois petites etoiles."


He gives a 1878 position of 06 02 07.47 +20 40 54.4 which precesses to 06 09 24.0 +20 39 53 (2000), and falls on the northwest side of the nebula.  This probably needs a small correction in declination based on his reference star, but is still accurate enough to clearly identify a small brighter patch of nebulosity.  His three stars are mag 13-14 and the knot of nebulosity is quite prominent on the DSS just following the middle of these three stars.  This star has a position of 06 09 21.9 +20 39 30 (2000) and Stephan's knot appears only 30-40" in diameter.

17.5": See description for NGC 2174.  Although the scattered group of stars involved with the HII region is identified as NGC 2175, the NGC description (from Auwers and Bruhns) does not refer to a cluster but rather a "*8m in neb (Auw No 21)".  The position given is 10' S of NGC 2174 and 16 tsec east.  But in the IC 2 notes and correction, Dreyer gives a correction in RA from Bigourdan to 06 01 32.  This places NGC 2175 at 06 09 52 +20 29.1 (2000) and is just 1' S of the brightest section of the nebula (about 3' ENE of mag 8 SAO 78049).  The scattered group is catalogued as Cr 84.


Carl Christian Bruhns discovered NGC 2175 = Au 21 in 1857 using a comet-seeker at the Berlin Observatory.  His position corresponds with mag 7.6 HD 42088.  Arthur Auwers described this nebula on 24 Feb 1861 with the 6" Heliometer at Konigsberg Observatory as "a considerable area of milky, faint light, extended about 8' north-south and 25' east-west.  In the brightest part is the 8m star."  Heinrich d'Arrest made 3 observations using the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen in Jan 1865 and wrote "the extraordinarily large, faint nebula is one of the objects which are difficult to see with higher magnification.  It took a long time to find it." (translations from Wolfgang Steincke).  E.E. Barnard also commented "In the finder (3 1/4-inch) [of the 12-inch Lick refractor], the 8m star is seem to be surrounded by a group of small stars - the whole being a loose cluster.  The cluster is enveloped in feeble nebulosity."  See my notes on NGC 2174.

18" (3/5/05): large, scattered group viewed at 115x with the 31mm Nagler.  Most distinctive is a "candy-cane" loop of a dozen mag 10-11 stars which closely wrap around to the east of mag 7.9 HD 29212 and then extends in a string to the NW ending in two mag 10 stars.  A scattering of brighter stars in the vicinity increase the apparent diameter to perhaps 20'x15', though besides the half-dozen or so brighter stars this appears to be an asterism.  A half-dozen mag 8.5-10 stars 10' to 12' E and north from the mag 7.1 star roughly define an eastern border to the group.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC though this may be an evolved, open cluster remnant that is partially stripped of former members.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2180 = H VIII-6 = h380 on 24 Jan 1784 (sweep 114) and reported "A Cl of scattered stars, about 30 large and many small ones."  A later sweep provided an accurate position.  On 2 Feb 1831 (sweep 320), John Herschel called it a "a fine cluster, coarse, p rich, place of a *9m."

William Herschel discovered NGC 2185 = H IV-20 = h383 on 16 Oct 1784 (sweep 296) and recorded as "a small star of the 11 or 12 mag, affected in the same manner [as NGC 2170], but very faint.  240 also showed it, other stars of the same magnitude are perfectly free from these appearances."

It is remarkable that the general milkiness which involves them, seems to be a little stronger about each star; but this last circumstance may be a deception arising from the light of the star."

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): although described as a "double nebula" by John Herschel, this close pair of galaxies received a single NGC entry.  At 260x the fused pair is oriented SW-NE with their outer halos overlapping.  The brighter northeast component was fairly bright, fairly small, round, 35" diameter, strong concentration.  The southwest member was between fairly faint and moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 40"x35", weak concentration, with the lower surface brightness of the pair.  This duo shines through the eastern portion of the LMC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2187 = h3025 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded a "Double nebula, position 12.5 degrees; larger pB, R, gbM, 40"; smaller vF, R, glbM." His position (measured on 3 sweeps) corresponds with the double system ESO 57-68A. On the other two sweeps he only recorded seeing a single object.  He called it double in the General Catalogue, although only a single designation was assigned.


Joseph Turner sketched the pair with the the Great Melbourne Telescope on 13 Dec 1878, as well as Pietro Baracchi on 3 Jan 1886.  The brighter NE galaxy was shown with a small bright nucleus and the SW galaxy has a smoother surface brightness.  Barrachi assumed the companion was a new discovery, although John Herschel probably deserves credit.

Truman Safford discovered NGC 2189 = HN 25/26 on Mar 19 1863 using the 15-inch Merz refractor at Harvard College Observatory.  In AN #1453, George Bond (then director of the observatory) noted "two clusters, seen 1863 Mar 19, near two stars of the 10th, 11th magnitude by J.H. Safford, with the Great Refractor."  The positions for the two stars are roughly 15' apart E-W although Dreyer used a mean position and only a single entry in the NGC. In any case, there are no obvious clusters on the DSS at his positions, just scattered stars.  The same night he also found NGC 2198, which appears to be nonexistent or a weak scattering of stars.

17.5" (12/23/97): this close pair of mag 13/14 stars was picked up at 100x just south of a mag 10 star.  At 220x and 280x this double star was cleanly resolved [10" separation] although the region between the pair and the bright star (just 30" from the southern star) appeared slightly hazy, probably due to two additional very close faint stars just below resolvability. At 410x, at least one very faint sparkle was occasionally glimpsed close to the mag 10 star.  It is not difficult to see why Lohse may have suspected this object to be nebulous.  Coincidentally, a very faint reflection nebula (GN 06.11.5) is located 6.7' NNW and it is misidentified as NGC 2195 in RNGC.


Gerhard Lohse discovered NGC 2195 around 1886 with the 15.5-inch refractor at the private Wigglesworth Observatory in England.  His position is 17 tsec west of a double star (with two additional very faint stars in a chain).  His description of a mag 10 star 30" north pins down this identification.  Interestingly, on my first observation of this object, I also thought it was nebulous - either due to glare from the mag 10 star or the closeness of the chain of the stars.  Coincidentally, there is a very faint reflection nebula (GM 1-45 = P-P 58) 6.7' NNE in the same field which was also visible in my 17.5" and this object has the same RA as Lohse's original position.  The RNGC has misidentified this reflection nebula as NGC 2195.  See Corwin's notes.


Wolfgang Steinicke commented "The discoverer was Gerhard Lohse, a German working at Scarborough using a 15.5 inch refractor. The object is one of 18 nebulae (from a total of 20) Dreyer put into the NGC. Lohse is among the observers with the poorest statistics:  Only 3 objects are real nebulae (the galaxies NGC 2518, 2565, 6792)! 12 are stars (or asterisms), 3 are "not found".  From the existing, NGC 2518 is the faintest, but an easy object with V around 13 mag a and compact core.  Due to this, it is questionable, if he really saw GM 1-45. The description of a 10 mag star 31" N matches the small group. In general Lohse's positions are not bad, there are "objects" at the places, but in most cases no nebulae."

NGC 2198

06 13 54 +01 00; Ori


24" (1/22/15): at the position given here is a 10' to 12' field with perhaps a half-dozen mag 10-11 stars and a number of fainter stars.  The group, though, is totally unimpressive and does not stand out in the general field.  On the southwest side is a 20" pair (one of Safford's 10th magnitude reference stars).   About 25' south is a scattered group of mag 9-10.5 stars (along with some fainter stars) that is much more distinctive, though doesn't match Safford's position.


Truman Safford discovered NGC 2198 = HN 27 on 19 March 1863, along with the nonexistent cluster NGC 2189, using the 15-inch Merz refractor at the Harvard College Observatory.  In AN #1453, George Bond (director of the observatory) reported "A cluster, seen 1863 March 19, by J.H. [sic] Safford, between two stars in the following position.  With the Great Refractor."  The positions for the two stars are fine (separated by ~8' east-west) but there is no obvious clustering nearby.


Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", reported "no CL, many pB st sf Dreyer's place."  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).  Harold Corwin suggests Safford's object might be "a scattered group of 20-30 stars, probably no more than a random field, centered at 06 11 56, +01 03.2 (B1950.0) that covers an area about 12 x 11 arcmin in size.  The stars range between 9th magnitude (the eastern-most of Safford's two stars) to about 13.

Within this irregular ring is a nice, mag 9.1/10.8 double (SAO 113671) at 10" separation.  Adding to the effect is a straight trail of stars from the double forming a 10' "stem" heading to the NNE and containing a mag 8.7 star (SAO 113677).  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC.


Wilhelm Struve discovered NGC 2202 = ∑ 885 = h385 in 1825 with the 9.6" refractor at the Dorpat Observatory and he listed it in his main catalogue of double stars.  John Herschel observed this cluster (or asterism) on 2 Feb 1831 (sweep 320) and recorded"The chief of a tolerably neat cluster of large stars."  The double star is a 9.1/10.8 pair at 10" separation located at 06 16 51.5 +05 59 47. Karl Reinmuth described the photographic appearance as "Cl, S, R, vP, st 8.5..." with dimensions 6.5'x6.5'.

48" (2/20/12 and 2/28/19): this beautiful spiral galaxy forms a stunning pair with IC 2163 attached to its east side.  The center is sharply concentrated with a brilliant nucleus embedded in a very bright core.  A mag 13.5 star is superimposed on the west-southwest edge of the core.  A couple of beautiful, winding spiral arms are visible in the halo.  An outer arm on the south end of the galaxy stretched to the west and curved counterclockwise north towards a mag 12.5-13 star situated 1.7' NW of center.  A second more inner arm vaguely emerged on the west side of the core and wrapped counterclockwise to the north, where it was parallel to the outer arm described above.  This arm then curved back east along the north side of the halo, stretching to the NE side of the halo, but not reaching IC 2163.  The region between the core and these arms were noticeably darker due to dust.


IC 2163 is attached at the east side of NGC 2207.  The central region was very bright, round, ~1' diameter, small bright core.  A surprisingly prominent spiral arm is attached on the southwest side.  It sweeps gracefully to the east and bends gently clockwise.  This arm was ~1.5' long and significantly increased the overall size to roughly 2'x1'.  Just northeast of the tip of the arm is 2MASX J06163579-2122032, which appeared as a faint, very small knot.  The 2MASX galaxy is probably a dwarf elliptical at the same distance as the pair.


18" (2/5/11): fairly bright, fairly large, sharply concentrated with a bright, elongated core (WSW-ENE) ~1' diameter and a large, much lower surface brightness halo ~2.5'x2.0'.  A faint star is close WSW of the nucleus.  A mag 13.5 star is at the NW edge of the halo.


Forms an interacting pair with IC 2163, which is embedded on the east side of the halo.  The fainter companion appears fairly faint, moderately large, oval E-W, 1.0'x0.7', weakly concentrated


13.1" (1/28/84): moderately bright, moderately large, bright core, double nuclei.  A faint extension is visible to the east.  This is an unusual interacting pair and the extension to the east is IC 2163.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2207 = h3032 on 24 Jan 1835 and recorded "pB, pL, mE in pos = +/- 87°, pslbM, 2.5' long, 40" broad, to a tolerably well defined round nucleus."  His position and Engelhardt's micrometric measurement are accurate, though I'm surprised that Herschel wasn't able to resolve the IC component of the system.


Joseph Turner observed this interacting pair on 18 Dec 1878 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope.  He wrote, "It appears to consist of two nebulae" and his sketch clearly shows IC 2163 elongated E-W as a separate object to the east.  He noted "the preceding one [NGC 2207] seems to have [three?] distinct nuclei or perhaps [three?] small stars."  Herbert Howe also resolved the pair on on 11 Feb 1898 with the 20" refractor at Denver and was credited with the visual discovery of IC 2163.  Holmberg 85b refers to the inner spiral arm (ring) to the west of the core.

Edward Cooper discovered NGC 2218 on 13 Jan 1853 with the large 13.3-inch refractor at the Markree Observatory in Ireland while compiling the Markree Ecliptic Catalogue.  Arthur Auwers couldn't find it using the 6" Heliometer at Konigsberg, though included it as #22 in his 1862 list of new nebulae.  Karl Reinmuth, using Heidelberg plates, reported "only 4 st 14...15".  There is only a small group of 3-5 stars on the DSS at Cooper's position.  The RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (Type 7).

NGC 2219

06 23 45 -04 40 36; Mon


17.5" (2/2/02): at 100x, 15-20 fairly faint mag 13-14 stars and a few brighter stars are visible just following mag 6.7 SAO 133199.  The group is elongated ~WNW-ESE and the stars are fairly evenly distributed.  The SE corner is marked by a mag 7.5 star.  Visually, this group appears to be a cluster as the star density is reasonably rich and the group is isolated in the field.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC and not in the Lynga catalogue.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2219 = h387 on 19 Feb 1830 and noted, "The first *6 of a course poor cl; *11...12."  His position corresponds with mag 6.7 SAO 133199 at 06 23 22.8 -04 41 15 (J2000).  Karl Reinmuthm, based on his 1926 photographic survey, gives a size of 10' and describes "Cl, pL, P, st 10...; B* BD -4 1484 p."  RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (Type 7).

Size 22'


24" (2/22/14): at 125x, this asterism is a scattered 20' field containing several bright stars.  There are two groupings with the more prominent southeast group containing 8 brighter stars including mag 7.7 HD 44737, mag 8.4 HD 44665, mag 8.8 HD 44764, along with 4 mag 10-11 stars.  These are scattered within an 8' region.  A separate group is to the northwest, separated by a 7'-8' gap, which contains 4 mag 9.5-10 stars.  Visually this appears to be a random grouping, though the number of bright stars is striking.  ESO 255-005 off the east side of the asterism was not seen.  Viewed at an elevation of only 8°.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2220 = h3042 on 29 Dec 1834 and recorded a "A poor, very coarsely scattered, but brilliant cluster of 8th class.  Place of a star 8m = B 1222, the chief of cl."  His position corresponds with mag 7.7 HD 44737 at 06 21 11.3 -44 45 31 (2000).  The asterism also includes HD 44665 = HJ 3852 (8.4/10.7 at 7") and mag 8.8 HD 44764.  WEBDA has no listing, and this grouping is probably an asterism.  RNGC calls NGC 2220 nonexistent (Type 7).

William Herschel discovered NGC 2224 = H VII-35 on 24 Dec 1786 (sweep 662) and described "A cluster of small pretty much compressed stars with suspected  nebulosity, but the latter may be a deception."  His position is close to a mag 9.6 star in a rich field containing some extremely faint nebulosity.   Robert Ball, observing with the 72" on 9 Dec 1866, noted "some stars scattered about, but no neby see.  Sky not good."


Karl Reinmuth reported "no pC Cl seen", based on Heidelberg plates. The RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent and it is not listed in any open cluster catalogue.  Harold Corwin there is an elongated group of very faint stars close to Herschel's position and these are embedded in very faint nebulosity, though I haven't checked this field.

17.5" (1/23/93): NGC 2226 is the core of NGC 2225 and consists of a 2' faint group of six mag 14 stars, over unresolved haze.  A mag 10 star is 1' S and a mag 12 star is 4' N.  NGC 2225 probably also consists of several nearby mag 13.5-14 stars forming a 5' group elongated N-S.  Herschel described the cluster as "hook" shaped.


Listed as nonexistent in RNGC though shows up well on the DSS.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2225 = H VII-26 = h388 on 30 Jan 1786 (sweep 516) and described "a cluster of extremely small and pretty much compressed stars, with a few larger ones, but not very rich; in the shape of a hook."  His position was off the southeast side of the cluster (or asterism) and the "large ones in the shape of a hook" probably refer to a group of stars off the northeast side of the core of the group. This cluster is not listed in the Lynga catalogue and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent with the comment "NOCL".  NGC 2226 is the small core of NGC 2225.

17.5" (1/23/93): faint group of six mag 14 stars over unresolved haze giving a fairly rich appearance.  Forms an irregular arc 2' length N-S bending west on the south end.  Located 1' N of a mag 10 star and a mag 12 star is 4' N.  Several more mag 13.5-14 stars are nearby, which together as a 5' group elongated N-S may form NGC 2225.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 2226 (discovery date unknown). Harold Corwin notes Barnard was probably using a 5- or 6-inch refractor at Nashville and the discovery was directly communicated to Dreyer.  His rough position is nearly identical to this cluster, but the NGC description "small,very difficult,*10 close S" suggests he only noted the core of the larger group (NGC 2225) discovered by WH.

At 397x the core seemed elongated ~E-W, but this was due to a mag 15.6 star that occasionally resolved at its east edge.  Located 11.6' NW of mag 8.2 HD 45462 (a wide 1.5' pair with a mag 9.9 star).


NGC 2228 is a member of ACO S585 = AGC 3389, which includes NGC 2229, 2230 and 2235, but is situated ~30' N of the core of the cluster.

Includes 7 brighter mag 8-10 stars and another two dozen fainter stars.  Richest surrounding 10 Mon and five brighter stars form a distinctive box around the bright star.  Too large and scattered for higher power.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2232 = H VIII-25 on 16 Oct 1784 (sweep 296) and recorded "The 10 Monocerotis surrounded by many bright stars."  His position matches the bright star.  The position in the Lynga catalogue, RNGC, NGC 2000.0 and Sky Catalogue 2000 is about 20' too far west!  Brian Skiff suggests a centroid position of 06 28 02 -04 50.8 based on the star GSC 4793-2505.  See my RNGC Corrections #7.


By analyzing William Herschel's earlier "reviews" of bright stars (before his systematic sweeps), which resulted in the discovery of many double stars, Wolfgang Steinicke found that Herschel discovered the cluster on 5 Dec 1779 using his 6.2" reflector.  This is apparently his earliest non-stellar discovery!

This poor grouping is immediately SE of the listed position.  The Milky Way is patchy here and the stars are set over unresolved haze.  This grouping appears a very weak field enhancement at best and not a cluster.


William Herschel described a larger grouping (nearly 30'), though the entire field is not really distinguishable from the surrouding area.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2234 = H VIII-9 = h389 on 19 Feb 1784 (sweep 148) and reported as "A cluster of stars very much scattered; takes up near 1/2 degree.  It is not very rich; the stars are of various magnitudes."  John Herschel described on 25 Jan 1832 (sweep 395), "a p rich v loose cl, fills 2 or 3 fields, not bM, st 10...13m."

13.1" (11/5/83 and 1/23/82): the complete annulus of the Rosette Nebula was clearly visible surrounding the naked-eye cluster NGC 2244.  Appears brightest and broadest in the NW region with a bright knot in the NE quadrant (NGC 2246).  The SE portion is split into two shells.  The western section has sharp corner on the inner edge.  NGC 2237 refers to a brighter section in the western section of the Rosette.  The brighter embedded cluster, NGC 2244, is offset within the 20', darker central region, and the SE end of the cluster (including the brightest member 12 Mon) spills over into the nebula.


8" (1/1/84): complete annulus easy visible in field at 42x or in 8x50 finder with filter as a large, soft ring surrounding the cluster.


Naked-eye (1/8/00): using an OIII filter, the apparent diameter of the cluster (NGC 2244) noticeably increases in size due to the surrounding nebulosity becoming visible.  The overall brightness, though, is slightly decreased with the filter as the cluster is significantly dimmed.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 2237 = Sw. II-31 between 1865 and 1874 while comet hunting using his 4.5-inch refractor. The discovery wasn't published, though, until 1884 (Sidereal Messenger, 3, 57-58).  Swift reported "Some ten years ago [implying a discovery date around 1874], while searching for comets, I ran across an exceedingly large and fairly bright nebula near 12 Mon which I of course supposed was familiar to every astronomer."  In the notes to his second list, Swift wrote "until 1881 I supposed it was a well known nebula.  Like the Merope nebula it requires a low power and a large field to see it well, and, like it, it also much obscured by a cluster of bright stars.  It slighty precedes and is a little north of the cluster [only one portion of the annulus seen], and at first would naturally be mistaken for a glow from it.


"Through ordinary telescopes it appears to have no visible boundaries, but through my 16-inch refractor it once under excellent conditions presented outlines sharp and distinc of an exact ellipse, with a pretty large easily seen nebula at each foci."


In an 1887 article he states the nebula was found "some fifteen years ago" or roughly 1872, and in an 1890 article (Sidereal Messenger, Volume 9, "A Wonderful Nebulous Ring"), he mentions the nebula was found "in about the year 1865".


E.E. Barnard independently discovered the Rosette on 29 Jan 1883 with his 5-inch refractor while searching for comets (Sidereal Messenger 4, 313). He commented in his logbook "Found a large nebulous object, [near] a scattering cluster of bright stars; it is elongated southwest and northeast.  Larger than the field of view."  Barnard's announcement prompted Swift to claim an earlier discovery.  Swift mentioned (notes to second list) that at his request Barnard reobserved it on 31 Oct 1885 [probably with the Lick 12-inch] and "estimates it to be one degree in length by a half degree in breadth", implying he saw the entire annulus.  Barnard showed the nebula to Swift when he visited Lick in January 1889.


Barnard referred to the nebula as "Swift's Nebula", though it was often called "Barnard's Ring" before the "Rosette Nebula" nickname was introduced. The oldest confirmed usage was in JRASC from 1949 (vol 43, 122): "Often referred to as the Rosette Nebula, it is known to astronomers as NGC 2237."

Although he noted the equivalence with H VII-2 = NGC 2244, he listed h392 separately in the GC (1420) probably because of the 1 min difference in RA and Dreyer catalogued the object as NGC 2239.

17.5" (1/31/87): faint, small, almost round.  Unusually weak filtration response as appears similar brightness or slightly fainter using filters!  Estimate V = 14.5.  This object was recently discovered to be a planetary in 1985 (Shaw and Bidelman) and is listed in the CGCG.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 2242 = Sw. VI-27 on 24 Nov 1886 with the 16" refractor at Warner Observatory.  This is the last planetary nebula, by discovery date, to be included in the NGC.  RNGC and CGCG (204-005) misclassify NGC 2242 as a galaxy although the RNGC new description reads "R, HISB, STEL, PLN??", so it questioned if it was perhaps a PN instead.


In 1985, spectroscopic investigations by Richard Shaw and William Bidelman revealed that NGC 2242 is a previously uncatalogued planetary nebula (independently shown to be a planetary by Machara in A&A 178, 221).  It was included as a new planetary nebula in Kohoutek's 4th update list (AN 315, 1994).  See my RNGC Corrections #2.

13.1" (1/18/85): fairly small faint cluster located just 8' SW of mag 7.4 SAO 196879.  Consists of unresolved haze except for four stars on the west edge and a few stars on the east edge.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2243 = h3053 on 19 Oct 1835 and recorded "pB, R, vglbM, all evidently resolved into stars, not very rich. Something between a cluster and a globular cluster. [This ob makes the RA 24m 8.9s, but it is pretty clear that this is a misreading of the chronometer.]"  On a second sweep he logged "pB, R, gbM, 4' diameter, mottled or resolved, amongst bright stars."  His mean position (two sweeps) matches this cluster.


James Dunlop possibly discovered the cluster earlier on 24 May 1826.  His entry for D 616 reads "an ill-defined faint nebulosity of some considerable extent, with several small stars scattered in it."  Although his description seems appropriate (though I don't believe he could have resolved stars in it), his position is 33' to the east-southeast.

17.5" (2/11/96): unusually bright, large cluster of ~15'x5' elongated NW-SE in a rectangular outline and situated in the heart of the Rosette Nebula!  The brightest 8 mag 6/7 stars lie along the sides and vertices of the rectangle with the brightest member, yellowish 12 Mon (V = 5.9), residing at the SE vertex.  There are ~40 stars within the cluster although the only concentration is fifteen mag 11/12 stars surrounding mag 6.8 SAO 114010 (W of center) and trailing to the east towards the wide bright pair of mag 8 stars east of center (one of these stars is the double STF 926 = 9.2/10.3 at 5").


8": bright, large cluster in the center of the Rosette Nebula.  The six brightest stars form a rectangular outline with the brightest star 12 Monocerotis (V = 5.9) at the SE corner.  At the north and NW corners of the rectangle are two bright wide pairs with mag 7/8 stars.  Many faint stars are near the center surrounding the wide pairs.  Faint naked-eye cluster in dark sky.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2244 = H VII-2 on 24 Jan 1784 (sweep 114) and described "the 12th Monocerotis is a beautiful scattered cluster of stars.  They are chiefly of two sorts; the first very brilliant, and the 2nd sort arranged in beautiful winding lines; of these there are about 30 or more.  There are besides many very small stars."  Wolfgang Steinicke reports that Herschel first observed the cluster earlier on 13 Jan 1783 (before starting his sweeps) using his 6.2-inch reflector.


John Flamsteed recorded the 6th magnitude star 12 Monocerotis on his Atlas Coelestis (17 Feb 1690).  But Stephen O'Meara notes that Flamsteed didn't note any of the fainter cluster stars (or general fuzziness), so doesn't deserve credit for the discovery.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2245 = H IV-3 = h393 on 16 Jan 1784 (sweep 81) and reported "A nebula.  It is fan shaped, and appears like a star with a faint, electric brush at one side of it."  On 18 Jan 1828 (sweep 120), John Herschel called it "a *11 with a milky neb surrounding it, but chiefly on the sp side.  The star is not sharp - not stellar, and the neb fades gradually away from the star; 70" or 80" diam; has a * 7m 30° nf."


The account by Lord Rosse (or assistant George Stoney) on Feb 28 1850 is remarkable: "...this neb is part of an enormous neby, which I traced following and north to a great distance, some degrees.  It narrows at times to a band across the finding eyepiece of about 6' or 8'.  I fancied the number of bright stars was greater in it than in the neighborhood; I am certain the number of small stars is much less..."

Dreyer also credited LdR with the co-discovery of NGC 2247.  It's possible that Dreyer was referring to Johnstone Stoney's comment on 28 Feb 1850, "...This nebula [NGC 2245] is part of an enormous neby, which I traced f and n to a great dist. some degrees."

Edward Cooper discovered NGC 2248 on 23 Dec 1853 with the large 13.3-inch refractor at the Markree Observatory in Ireland.  Auwers included it as #23 in his 1862 table of new nebulae and mentioned in the 6" Heliometer at Konigsberg it appeared "extremely faint, just resolvable spot of 2-3' dia. The brightest star 12m."  At Cooper's position is a small clump of stars (45" diameter), including a mag 12/13 pair at 16" separation with several fainter stars in a chain to the east.  Harold Corwin calls this an "asterism of nine stars".  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

The  brightest star in near the geometric center and is part of second group of ~20 stars with several in a 2' loop.  The bright star is a mag 9.5/11.5 pair at 9".  Finally, on the north side is a small string of a half-dozen stars oriented E-W.

The brightest mag 9.5 star is part of a small, roundish subgroup on the west side and is a pleasing double with components mag 9.5/12 at 10".  This subgroup has three brighter stars and 15 faint stars mostly west of the double.  The main string is fairly uniform except for an empty 3' gap SE of the mag 9.5 star.  Located 5' NW of the cluster is an isolated mag 10 star which appears to be a field star.

The western group is 2' diameter and includes a close double star 10/12 at 10".  The NW group is 3' diameter and includes two mag 11 stars with three mag 13 stars between.  The SE group is largest and includes 15 stars in a 6' string very elongated N-S with a close double star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2251 = H VIII-3 = h395 on 26 Dec 1783 (very early sweep 67) and noted "a small cluster of very close stars, not very remarkable."

The surrounding field was examined at 125x (49' field of view) and the only object that caught my attention was a 4' string containing a dozen mag 13-14 stars oriented SW-NE.  In addition, a larger group of mag 14 stars is just south (though detached), with the total size of both groups roughly 10'.  This asterism is penned in by some brighter stars: mag 9.6 star (SAO 13933) is just north of the group, mag 7.7 HD 47522 is southeast and mag 7.2 HD 47215 is roughly 10' S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2253 = H VII-54 on 1 Nov 1788 (sweep 879) and recorded "A vF patch of eS stars."  There is nothing at Harold Corwin's re-reduced position of 06 41 52 +65 50.3 (J2000) -- similar to Auwers -- and Bigourdan failed to recover this object.  Corwin suggests NGC 2253 might be "a small group of about 10-15 stars" at 06 42 32 +66 24.3 (2000).  This clump is roughly 30' north of WH's position (possibly a digit error) and described above.


RNGC, CGCG and SIMBAD misidentify CGCG 308-037 as NGC 2253.  This galaxy is located at 06 43 14.7 +65 40 39 (2000).  NED and HyperLeda equate UGC 3511 with NGC 2253 (originally proposed by Sue French?), though NED notes the identification is very uncertain.

48" (5/1/19): at 375x; the view through this scope showed a great deal of structure and brightness variations.  I was struck by the length of the eastern edge, which dimmed after the bright thin section extending north, but could be traced just beyond two mag 17-17.5 stars, for a total length of 3'.


18" (3/4/08): Hubble's variable nebula is a striking fan-shaped object, with a mag 12 "star" at its south tip with the nebula extending to the north.  The fan displays a great deal of variation in brightness and structure at 300x.  The brightest portion is on the northwest side of the fan, though it dims a little near the tip on the west side.  The eastern rim is bright and sharply defined N-S like a thin finger. The nebulosity dims along the northern end of the fan and a small, wedge-shaped darker area extends into the fan from the north.


13.1" (1/28/84): Hubble's Variable Nebula is bright, small, fan-shaped 2:1 N-S and widest at the north boundary.  The nebulosity tapers down towards 12th magnitude R Monocerotis at the south tip which appears to have a very small high surface brightness halo.  The western edge (oriented NW-SE) is slightly weaker and more curved than the eastern edge which is sharper and straighter N-S.  This is an impressive nebula with high surface brightness and interesting structure.

The apex of the neb comex exactly up to star, but does not pass it."


Lord Rosse and/or assistant George Johnstone Stoney first observed NGC 2261 on 22 Dec 1848 and again on 11 Feb 1849.  Rosse or Stoney sketched the nebula on 16 Jan 1850 (plate XXXVII, figure 10) and noted "two comparatively dark spaces, one near the vertex and other near the base of the cone."  William Lassell observed and sketched NGC 2261 in March 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector from Malta. He noted, "the nucleus not stellar, but like the nucleus of the nebula in Andromeda [M31]." Father Angelo Secchi published a detailed sketch and description in 1856 using the 9.6" refractor in Rome.


Julius Schmidt discovered the variability of R Mon in 1861 with a 6" refractor.   While a graduate student at Yerkes Observatory in 1916, Hubble discovered the nebula itself was variable, hence the popular nickname. A series of photographs chronically the changes were taken with the 30" Reynolds reflector between 1916-1920 at the Helwan Observatory in Egypt.  This is an unusual bipolar nebula with the second southern jet hidden from view.  According to the California Institute of Technology, Hubble's Variable Nebula was the first object photographed through the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory. Hubble sat in the prime focus cage of that instrument and recorded an image on 26 Jan 1949.

V = 3.9;  Size 60'x30'


17.5" (12/28/00): besides the bright nebulosity extending southwest of mag 4.7 S Monocerotis (15), most of the central region of the cluster was set against a weakly glowing background (part of Sh 2-273).  At the southern end of the cluster (tip of the "Christmas Tree"), this low surface brightness glow was more evident and clearly extended beyond the 7th magnitude star at the tip towards the SE.  The west edge of this weakly glowing extension forms the eastern border of the dark Cone Nebula (LDN 1613).  There is a lack of faint stars within the region of the Cone Nebula but the inclusion itself was not darker than the general background.


17.5" (12/30/99): nebulosity was quite prominent to the SW of south Mon as well as a weaker glow in the vicinity around ∑954 at the south end of the cluster.  At 100x (unfiltered) there appeared to be a slightly darker vacuity to the south of this star in the position of the Cone nebula but there is no sharp "edge" with the nearby nebulosity.


13" (11/5/83): very bright, very large scattered group, elongated N-S, striking Christmas tree shape.  A bright multiple star 15 Monocerotis = south Mon (4.7-7.5 at 2.8" and companions) is at the base of the tree at the north end of the cluster and is surrounded by several stars.  Easy nebulosity is visible which extends 10' SW of south Mon and includes a group of three brighter stars.  At the south end of the cluster is the double star ∑954 = 7.1/9.6 at 13".  The Cone nebula (not seen) extends south of ∑954 and "points" towards ∑954.


8" (11/5/83): bright, very large, scattered, Christmas tree outline, fairly rich, includes multiple star south Mon.


Naked-eye (1/8/00): vislble as a 4th magnitude nebulous glow including the mag 5 star (S Mon), but appears much smaller naked-eye than the listed dimensions.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2264 = H V-27 = H VIII-5 = h401 on 18 Jan 1784 (sweep 81) and recorded VIII-5 as "The 15th Mon is attended by above 30 considerable stars, and is itself a double star of the 3rd class.  The star extremely unequal and probably not visible in smaller instruments. There is also another double star of the 3rd class not far from it consisting of equal stars."  On 26 Dec 1785 (sweep 494) he logged V-27 as "I observed about 7' or 8' sp 15 Mon, some of the pB stars to be contained within vF milky nebulosity which loses itself imperceptibly; but there remains a doubt of the reality."  On the 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 496) he mentioned "I examined the stars south preceding 15 Mon and believe they contain Milky nebulosity.  It is very difficult to ascertain it on account of the glare of the 15th, but I have hardly any doubt.  Again on 11 Jan 1787 (sweep 682) he noted "I suspect the sp 2 stars (of which one is Double [15 Mon] to be affected with vF milky nebulosity but may be a deception."  WH's descriptions and position apply to the cluster and to the brightest part of the nebulosity southwest of mag 4.7 S Monocerotis.  John Herschel also reported on 18 Jan 1828 (sweep 120), "a *5.6 enveloped in a nebulous haze.", although he may have just seen scattered light around the bright star.


The region around 15 Mon was examined a number of times at Birr Castle, searching for nebulosity.  There were 9 negative results before 1861 and Lord Rosse wrote "No neby. Found, and only a few stars arranged in pairs; no cl.  Has there been a change here?  Heinrich d'Arrest also missed seeing nebulosity in 1862 at Copenhagen with the 9" refractor.  But successful observations were made at Birr Castle in 1863 and 1878 (the later by Dreyer).  E.E. Barnard and Roberts reported extensive nebulosity in the region based on photographs.


On 10 May 1895 Isaac Roberts showed a three-hour exposure of the NGC 2264 complex taken with his 20-inch reflector on 13 Feb to a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. It clearly showed the nebulosity southwest of S Mon (first photographed by Barnard in 1894) but also revealed a “conical dark space bounded by a rim of nebulosity” — this is the famous ‘Cone Nebula’.

17.5" (2/1/03): this is a Milky Way cloud of ~50 faint stars mag 12-14.  There is central "hole" lacking any stars, and there are no rich subgroups.  Does not look to be a reasonable cluster and candidate and in fact, doesn't stand out in the field at 100x. There does seem to be some unresolved background or Milky Way glow.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2265 = h402 on 23 Jan 1832 (sweep 393) and described "A poor cluster 30 or 40 small stars 12-13m."  Karl Reinmuth called this "a rich region, >1 degree, no distinct Cl.", based on its photographic appearance. There is a scattering of mag 10-13 stars near Herschel's position on the POSS, but nothing that looks like a cluster. RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent.

48" (4/4/13): at 488x, NGC 2276 appeared fairly bright, fairly large, irregularly round, 2' diameter.  Contains a very small, very bright nucleus, surrounded by a patchy halo with weak spiral structure.  The most prominent arm winds along the western edge of the galaxy, curving from west to northwest and creating a very asymmetric appearance.  Along this arm segment is a prominent knotty section with two or three clumps, including [HK83] 69, a bright 6" knot.  On the southwest side of the halo is [HK83] 63, a faint 6" knot on a line between the nucleus and the 8th-magnitude star (HD 51141) 2.3' SW. In the brighter central region surrounding the nucleus are several brighter, small patches that define the inner arms.  A slightly brighter region close southwest of the nucleus includes the multiple designations [HK83] 17/42/46/51.  Finally, [H83] 24/27 are weak enhancements on the southeast side of the nucleus.  HII region #24 was the site of SN 2005dl.


24" (9/15/12): moderately bright, fairly large, round, 2' diameter.  Although spiral arms were not visible, the galaxy has an odd appearance with brighter knots and regions resolved.  A non-stellar knot, identified in NED as NGC 2276:[HK83] 69 is visible at the NW edge.  The central region contains a faint quasi-stellar nucleus, along with one or two other stellar knots including NGC 2276:[HK83] 24, close east of the nucleus. Another knot (nonstellar) is southwest of the nucleus (perhaps NGC 2276:[HK83] 63).  The halo appears weaker on the east side and brighter on the west side.  Located 2.3' ENE of a mag 8 star and it helps to move the star just outside the field.


18" (8/2/11): moderately bright, large, round, ~2.0' diameter, weak concentration, slightly brighter core.  The halo has an irregular surface brightness giving a strong impression of spiral structure with slightly brighter knots on the west side.  Located 2.3' ENE of mag 8.1 HD 51141, which hinders viewing and a mag 11.7 star is squeezed between the bright star and the galaxy.  Brighter NGC 2300 lies 6' SE.  These are the 3rd and 4th closest NGC galaxies to the North Celestial Pole.


18" (3/13/04): fairly faint, large, slightly elongated,~2.0'x1.6', low surface brightness.  The halo fades gradually into the background, particularly on the eastern side, so it was difficult to determine a definite edge.  Located 2.2' E of mag 8.4 SAO 1148 which detracts from viewing.  Forms a trio with NGC 2300 6' SE and IC 455.


13.1" (1/18/85): diffuse, slightly elongated.  Located 2.2' ENE of mag 8.4 SAO 1148 which interferes with viewing.  Three mag 11 stars also in line with the 8.4 star to the south including a mag 11.5 star just 1.4' SW.  Forms a pair with NGC 2300 6.4' ESE.


8" (1/1/84): faint, moderately large, low surface brightness, slightly elongated.  A mag 9 star is near.


Friedrich August Winnecke discovered NGC 2276 on 26 Jun 1876 with the 6.5" refractor at the Strausberg Observatory.  Wilhelm Tempel independently discovered the galaxy the same year with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and included it in his first list (#20).  Winnecke also thought he discovered NGC 2300 but Borrelly found that galaxy earlier (either 1871 or 1872) at Marseille.  NGC 2276 is the 3rd closest to the pole in the NGC or IC.

It was found while he was measuring previously discovered nebulae (and asterisms) in the area.  RNGC misidentifies NGC 2279 = NGC 2275.

18" (3/13/04): ~75 stars in a 30' region to the south of mag 7.3 HD 49009.  A number of stars are arranged in a looping chain.  There is a neat kite-shaped group of 6 stars (including two pairs at 10" and 15") in the middle of the chain with a faint star in the center.  Scattered stars extend to the south, beyond the kite.  The group is fairly bright and distinctive and includes a number of mag 9-10 stars, although there are no dense subgroups.


13.1": ~40 stars mag 7-13 in cluster, bright, loose.  Five double stars are visible including a mag 9.5-11.0 pair at 11" and a mag 11.0-11.5 pair at 15".


William Herschel discovered NGC 2281 = H VIII-71 on 4 Mar 1788 (sweep 813) and recorded "a cluster of coarsely scattered pretty large stars, pretty rich, the place is that of a double star of the third class."  His RA is 1.0 minute too large.  The position carried forward to the GC and NGC and modern catalogues including the Lynga Open Clusters Catalog (5th edition) and the RNGC.


By analyzing William Herschel's early "reviews" of bright stars that resulted in the discovery of many double stars, Wolfgang Steinicke recently found (email Oct '16) that Herschel first discovered the cluster on 6 Nov 1782 using his 6.2" reflector.

13.1" (1/18/85): very faint reflection nebula with a mag 10 star involved, fairly small, round.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 2282 on 3 Mar 1886 with the 6-inch Cooke refractor at Vanderbilt University (announced in AN 2756 and Sidereal Messenger, vol. 5, p154).  He reported finding "a star of 9.5 or 10 magnitiude, with a faint nebulosity surrounding it. I strongly suspect that is not a stellar point but an extremely small nebula with faint nebulosity surrounding.  At best with the 6-inch it did not appear like any of the neighboring stars.  A short distance (4' or 5') preceding this and very slightly north is a faint double star that I suspect is enveloped in nebulosity."  His position matches the central star HD 289120 of this reflection nebula.


Barnard later found this reflection nebula again on 30 Oct 1888 using the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted a "9 1/2 mag star with faint nebulosity about it.  1' in diameter, a little heavier nf.  Examined several other stars near, and no nebulosity seen."  Apparently Barnard didn't connect this with his earlier observation and notified Dreyer who catalogued it again as IC 2172, at nearly the identical position.  So, NGC 2282 = IC 2172.


This RN is involved with a sparse open cluster OCL 535.1 = C0644+013, listed in Lynga 5 as vdB 85, although Barnard made no reference to an associated cluster.  Brian Skiff noticed the equivalence.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2283 = H III-271 on 6 Feb 1785 (sweep 367) and reported "3 or 4 small stars with vF nebulosity between them forming an irregular triangle.  240 power showed the same very plainly."  Auwers made an error reducing WH's position, but JH corrected the error in the GC and his position matches ESO 557-013  = PGC 19562.  Herbert Howe, observing in 1898-1899 with the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver, described "a small quadrilateral of stars of mag 11, 12, 11, and 13, the interior of which in nearly filled by an eF nebulosity."


Harold Corwin comments that E.E. Barnard's IC 2171 may be a duplicate observation (see his identification notes on that number).  Dave Riddle notes Sven Cederblad catalogued this galaxy as a reflection nebula (Ced 86) and it was later included in the Dorschner and Gurtler reflection nebula catalogue as DG 111.

24" (1/22/15): this number applies to one of two possible triples.  At 200x, I found a mag 13.8 star with a mag 14.5 star 19" SW and a mag 15-15.5 star 19" N.  The stars were widely split with no hint of appearing nebulous.  A fourth mag 16-16.5 star listed in Corwin's table was not seen viewing through thin clouds.


Just 2' SE of these stars is a very nice equilateral triple!  The three stars range from mag 12.3-13.5 with sides of 10", 12" and 13".  These were also easily resolved.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2284, along with NGC 2285, on 20 Apr 1865 with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen Observatory.  Near his position is is a pair of mag 13.8/14.5 stars stars at 19" separation with a mag 15-15.5 star a similar distance from the brighter star.  Alister Ling found "a triple star (using 255x) amidst a chain of singles and doublets."  This trio is 2.4' SSE of d'Arrest's position, but more eye-catching visually.  Harold Corwin lists both candidates.  The RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

24" (1/22/15): at 200x; a 12" pair of mag 14.6 and 15.8 stars was resolved.  The fainter star was difficult in hazy conditions.  Just 1.6' southeast is a relatively bright double, consisting of mag 10.8/12 stars at 11" separation.  d'Arrest didn't mention this pair, which should have been easily resolved, though it is certainly much more eye-catching.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2285, along with NGC 2284, on 20 Apr 1865 with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen Observatory.   About 1' northeast of his single position is a mag 14.6/15.8 pair of stars at 12" separation and he was uncertain if it was nebulous or stellar.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

17.5" (12/20/95): at 100x, ~40 stars within an arbitrary 10' region, elongated N-S.  This is a fairly rich group of mostly mag 12 and 13 stars bordered by brighter stars grouped in pairs and trios.  There is some concentration with a richer 4' core.  A wide pair of mag 9 stars is off the SE side.

Richest in a lane running NNW-SSE over haze although the brightest mag 10 stars are outliers to the W, north and SE.  There is also a bright lane 15' length oriented N-S located to the east of the main group which includes several wide double stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2286 = H VIII-31 = h408 on 6 Jan 1785 (sweep 352) and noted "A larger cluster of scattered stars, not v rich."  John Herschel made two observations and noted on 4 Jan 1827 (sweep 41), a "Loose L irreg scattered cl of about 100 st 9...15m."

18" (2/14/10): this naked-eye cluster was perfectly framed at 73x with the 31mm Nagler (67' field).  M41 extends roughly 35' in diameter though many of the brighter mag 7 and 8 stars are in a smaller central region.  The cluster includes roughly a dozen brighter stars, many forming a large central oval ~15'-20' diameter and elongated E-W or SW-NE.  Near the center is a richer grouping with a number of fainter stars and two bright stars including orange (K3-class) mag 6.9 HD 49091 (brightest member).


A number of loops and chains appear to spin out from the central grouping.  One long chain extends NNW to the edge of the cluster and a shorter nearby chain heads WNW and includes a pretty equal mag pair before bending abruptly SW.  Two other chains extend from the center to the SW and ENE.  About 20' SE of the center of the cluster is mag 6.1 HD 49333, the brightest star in the field though not a member.


8" (10/4/80): ~60 stars mag 7-11.5, very bright, very large, very rich, includes 10 bright stars mag 7 and 8.  Many of the stars are arranged in curving rows and groups, includes several double stars.  Located about 20' NW of mag 6.0 12 Canis Majoris.  Naked-eye object in dark sky.


Naked-eye (numerous times): fairly easy naked-eye glow in a dark sky.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered M41 = NGC 2287 = h411 in 1654, using a small refractor at 20x.  It was independently discovered by John Flamsteed on 16 Feb 1702: "Near this star (12 CMa), there is a cluster."  Le Gentil also found it in 1749.  Wolfgang Steinicke credits Aristotle with a naked-eye discovery about 325 based on comments by J.E. Gore in his 1902 review of the Messier objects.  But the source material is not very reliable.  See http://seds.org/messier/more/m041_ari.html for this possibility.


William Herschel recorded M41 in 1784 as "A large cluster of very coarsely scattered large [bright] stars." and in Mar 1830 John Herschel called M41 "Coarse; fills field.  The chief, 8m, is red; a poor cluster."  The position in the NGC, RNGC and NGC 2000 is 1 tmin of RA too far east.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2289 = H III-897 = h409, along with NGC 2290, on 4 Feb 1793 (sweep 1031).  His description reads, "Two, eF and vS.  The place is taken between them.  They are about 4' asunder and northern one which is the largest precedes the other about 2 sec.  300x shows the same."  Assuming Herschel observed the brightest two galaxies with the orientation NNW-SE, then H III-897 = NGC 2289 and H III-898 = NGC 2290 (Dreyer was confused on the identifications in the GC and NGC).  His RA was 15 sec too large, but the NPD is in between the pair. John Herschel also observed the two galaxies and measured the same orientation and 3 or 4' apart. In the NGC, Dreyer incorrectly assigned H. III-898 to NGC 2289.


The RNGC reverses the identifications of NGC 2288 and NGC 2289.  MCG also misidentifies this galaxy as NGC 2288.  See my RNGC Corrections #1 and Malcolm Thomson's article in the Webb Society Quarterly Journal in 1/84.

Herbert Howe measured an accurate RA for NGC 2296 in 1898 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) using the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory.  So, NGC 2296 = IC 452.


MCG -03-18-003 misclassified this object as a galaxy, though V-V commented "this is almost a diffused nebulosity, but it is not in any catalogue", and it was later catalogued as PGC 19643. According to Wolfgang Steinicke, this was the last reflection nebula, by discovery date, to be included in the NGC.

25" (4/6/19 - OzSky): at 244x; extremely bright, large, highly resolved globular with an intensely bright 1.5' core and a scraggly 4' halo.  Due to a fairly loose structure and brighter members, the cluster was well resolved into more than 50 stars.  A number of fairly bright stars are plastered across the core and the halo contains a few dozen brighter stragglers.  A noticeable chain of stars begins in the core and extends southwest.  A brighter star (double) is near the edge of the halo on the NE side.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 200x, this is a compact, fairly bright globular that is well-concentrated with a bright 1.5' core and a fainter halo of ~3' diameter.  Roughly two dozen stars are resolved (brightest cluster members are mag 13.4) including several across the core and a number of stragglers, which are easier to resolve in the outer halo.


17.5" (1/31/87): moderately large globular with no sharp core.  A dozen stars are resolved over the mottled disc.


8" (1/1/84): no resolution, fairly small, smooth.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2298  = D 578 on 8 May 1826 and described "a pretty bright round nebula, 3' or 4' diameter, moderately condensed to the centre. This is resolvable into stars."   He made 6 observations and his published position is 6' W of center of the globular.


JH observed the globular (h3065) on four sweeps from the Cape of Good Hope, first recording it on 2 Feb 1835 as "B, R, gpmbM, 3', all resolved into stars 14th mag. In the centre is a star 13th mag."

John Herschel discovered NGC 2299 = h412 on 19 Jan 1828 and described "A coarse cl, not v rich, 30 or 40 st, probably only an outlying portion of VIII 39 [NGC 2302]".  There is nothing at his position (about 7' W of mag 6.6 HD 50138), though it is marked as uncertain. Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Neblel", comments "many st, but nothing like a cluster."


Harold Corwin notes that JH's positional offset from NGC 2302 (discovered earlier by WH) is "nearly the same as NGC 2338 (which see), found in the same sweep on 19 January 1828."  So, he concludes NGC 2299 = NGC 2302, despite that JH apparently thought he was observing a different cluster.

The tail of stars is slightly concave to the south and is marked by a mag 10.5 star at the west end.  Although the star chain is quite noticeable, it could well be an asterism as there are other similar strings of stars in the same or adjacent fields.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


William Herschel possibly discovered NGC 2319 on 18 Dec 1783 (early sweep 48) and noted "a cluster of vS stars not very rich."  He states this cluster follows 18 Mon by 11 minutes, but only gave a rough polar distance (75' range).  It was assigned the internal discovery #12, but not an H-designation.


John Herschel rediscovered NGC 2319 = h423 in March 1830 (sweep 237) and recorded a "Linear cluster of stars 11..13m forming a bent line nearly 15' long, terminating on the following side by a *8 whose place is that here taken."  His position corresponds with mag 8.8 SAO 114784 at 07 01 06.5 +03 03 11.  The "bent line" of stars preceding is oriented WNW-ESE and is fairly striking.  JH equated h423 with his father's #12, but identified it as VIII-1 (the previous class VIII object discovered by his father).  In the GC, he referred to it as VIII-1B.  In the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues, Dreyer gives the details of the sweep.  Steinicke suggests VIII-1B = h423. The RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (probably an asterism).

The cluster has roughly a triangular or wedge-shaped outline, highlighted by an 8' string of stars oriented ~E-W on the north side (including mag 9.0 HD 52965) and a longer 10' string oriented NW-SE on the SW side that includes the brightest cluster star - distinctly orange mag 7.8 HD 52938 near the SE end of the string.  Along this string are also four easy pairs of stars.  There is a rich circular group of stars, ~5' diameter, a little north of center.  On the east side of the cluster is an unequal double, h748 = 8.5/11 at 15".  A faint, unequal pair of stars, BRT 392 = 11.5/11.6 at 4", is due west of the unequal pair by 3.5' at the edge of the rich group of stars.  A number of stragglers extend out the cluster increasing the size significantly and a scattered group with some brighter stars including mag 9.0 HD 52720 appears detached to the NW.


13.1" (3/24/84): ~75 stars including some brighter stars at the south and northeast borders.  There are a few dense spots and many stragglers.  An orange/red mag 8 star is at the south edge and a nice 16" pair of mag 9/11 stars (h748) is 1' NW.  There is an elongated 4'x3' region that is devoid of stars just north of the colored mag 8 star.  Located 42' E of mag 6.0 HD 52312.


Giovanni Domenico Cassini possibly discovered M50 = NGC 2323 = h425 around 1711.  Charles Messier independently discovered the cluster on 5 Apr 1772.

18" (2/23/06): moderately bright, 1' reflection nebula surrounding a mag 9.5 star with a mag 12 companion at 7".  Viewed unfiltered at 225x.


17.5" (3/8/02): small but high surface brightness reflection nebula surrounding an unequal pair of mag 9.5/12.5 stars at 7" separation.  At 280x, the nebulosity is round and approximately 50" in size although it fades smoothly into the background and may be a bit larger.  This small knot of nebulosity is at the western end of a striking arc of 6 stars which trail off to the NE.  The next star in the arc, 1.5' E, also seems to be encased in a very small halo.  A similar mag 9.5 comparison star (with no halo) lies 4' ESE and several other mag 9.5-10.5 stars are scattered across the field.  The background sky in this vicinity is weakly luminous, as NGC 2327 is situated midway along the western side of IC 2177, a huge IC strip of nebulosity straddling Canis Major and Monoceros.  This object did not respond to OIII, UHC or H-beta filters so appears to be predominantly a reflection nebula.


This bright nebula was discovered by William Herschel (IV 25) in 1785 and reobserved by his son, John.  Although their positions and descriptions match this object,there is a great deal of confusion in the literature as to its identification and position and some sources misidentify NGC 2327 with the much larger Sh 2-292 = Gum 1 located 50' to the north (also associated with IC 2177).


13.1" (12/22/84): fairly faint reflection nebula, fairly small, surrounds a mag 8 star (close unequal double).  Located along the faint, extremely large, curving strip of nebulosity = IC 2177.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2327 = H IV-25 = h428 on 31 Jan 1785 (sweep 363) and described "A pretty considerable star with vF and vS milky chevelure of an irregular chevelure, other stars of the same size are perfectly free from that appearance."  John Herschel reported on 11 Mar 1828 (sweep 130), "a double star whose large star is in the center of a very faint nebula which involves the small star also."  His position of 07 04 07.6 -11 19.0 pins down the identification as a compact HII/Reflection nebula on the west side of the Seagull Nebula. In 1886, Engelhardt also published an accurate micrometric position of  07 04 07.77 -11 18 56.6 (J2000).  Herbert Howe noted the central star is double with separation 7".


Joseph Turner (date uncertain) and Pietro Baracchi (11 Mar 1885) observed this nebula with the 48" Melbourne telescope.  Turner's sketch was included in the unpublished plate V, figure 39).


Despite John Herschel's accurate position and description, there's been a great deal of confusion in the literature as to the identification and position.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2329 = H II-735 = h429 on 9 Mar 1788 (sweep 815) and called "F, stellar." His position is 3' east of UGC 3695, the brightest galaxy in AGC 569.  He observed the field again on 28 Dec 1790 (sweep 990) and picked up two galaxies -- NGC 2329 and UGC 3696, oriented southwest-northeast (12 sec of time and 2' north).  Caroline assumed the southwest object was new and assigned it III-875.  She thought the northeast object was II-735, so it didn't receive a new designation.  John Herschel only saw a single galaxy and equated H. II-735 = H. III-875 in the General Catalogue.  Dreyer assigned both designations to NGC 2329.  Since WH clearly observed both galaxies on 28 Dec 1790, Wolfgang Steinicke concludes III-875 should refer to UGC 3696, a galaxy that should have received a NGC designation.


Although usually classified as a Lenticular Galaxy, recent studies have concluded NGC 2329 is a 'cluster dominant' Elliptical Galaxy (cD). It is an x-ray source with a radio jet streaming from its core, like many other cD's. In addition that is also a 'radio tail' extending from this galaxy.

Bindon Stoney or his brother George Johnstone, Lord Rosse's assistants, discovered NGC 2330 on 2 Jan 1851.  He noted a small nebula, which was labeled "b" on the published diagram, and placed SSW of NGC 2332 (the direction of drift is reversed on the sketch).  At this position is CGCG 234-074 = PGC 20272.  This galaxy was also labeled Delta on the final constructed sketch.


Although 9 nebulae were found at Birr Castle over 3 nights, the 1861 publication only included the comment "several knots around" NGC 2332.  JH added just one new entry in the GC (1492), which Dreyer assigned to either NGC 2330 and NGC 2334 (with question marks).


Since absolute positions were not computed at Birr Castle, Dreyer relied on Bigourdan's erroneous position (he measured a faint star) for NGC 2330.  As a result NGC 2330 was misplaced 2.4' north of NGC 2332 instead of south-southwest (as on the 1851 sketch).  In 1893, Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position and Dreyer catalogued it as IC 457.  Assuming this is the nebula Dreyer had in mind as NGC 2330 (Malcolm Thomson disagrees), then NGC 2330 = IC 457 = CGCG 234-074.  Ironically, Bigourdan measured accurate positions for the other Rosse nebulae in 1885, but these were not published until 1919, so Kobold (and LdR) were given credit for these in the IC.


The RNGC reverses the identifications of NGC 2330 and NGC 2332, making NGC 2330 the brighter northern member of the pair and incorrectly describes NGC 2332 as "almstel" (same error in MCG).  UGC and CGCG label NGC 2330 as IC 457.  See RNGC Corrections #5 and Corwin's notes for much more on this complicated story!

He noted a small nebula (unlabeled on a sketch of h433 = NGC 2340) 6' south-following NGC 2340.  Unfortunately the direction of drift was confused as CGCG 234-095 = PGC 20357 is 6' north-following NGC 2340.  This galaxy was also labeled Theta on the final constructed sketch.


Although 9 nebulae were found at Birr Castle on 3 nights, the 1861 publication only included the comment "several knots around" NGC 2332.  JH added just one new entry in the GC (GC 1492), which Dreyer assigned to either NGC 2330 and NGC 2334 (with question marks) and the additional Rosse nebulae were not included in the NGC.


Since absolute positions weren't computed at Birr Castle, Dreyer relied on Bigourdan's erroneous position for NGC 2334 (he measured a faint star 3' ENE of NGC 2332).  In 1893, Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position for Stoney's nebula and Dreyer recatalogued it as IC 465.  So, NGC 2334 = IC 465.  Ironically, Bigourdan measured accurate positions for the other Rosse nebulae in 1885, but these were not published until 1919, so Kobold (and LdR) were given credit in the IC.  Karl Reinmuth couldn't find NGC 2334 (at Bigourdan's position) and noted "in Dreyer's place not found, = IC 464?"


The question remains if IC 465 is the galaxy Dreyer meant as NGC 2334.  Dreyer credits both Rosse and Kobold in the IC, so this seems probable, although Malcolm Thomson disagrees.  MCG, CGCG, PGC, SIMBAD all label this galaxy as IC 465 and not NGC 2334.  NED and HyperLeda give the equivalence. See Corwin's identification notes for more on this complicated situation.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2336 = T I-22 in 1876 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and described a "beautiful II class nebula, R, lbM, 2' diameter, forms a triangle with two mag 10-11 stars."  Tempel's very rough position (only the hour of RA is given!) is off by 2.5 tmin of RA (west) and 3' dec (north) and the two stars in the description are just north.

NGC 2338

07 07 47 -05 43 12; Mon


17.5" (2/3/03): roughly 3 dozen stars in an elongated N-S group, ~8'x3'.  Includes a few mag 11 stars, with the rest of stars mag 12-14.  Just stands out at 100x as a weak field enhancement and detached enough in the field that a definite border can be traced out.  Still this is probably just an unrelated group of stars and NGC 2338 is listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2338 = h435 on 19 Jan 1828 (sweep 122) and noted a "Very loose and straggling cluster."  There is nothing noticeable at JH's (uncertain) position.  In 1926, Karl Reinmuth noted (based on Heidelberg plates) "many st, but nothing like a cluster." and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 2338 is a group of stars ~50 tsec of RA east and 5' south of his position.  If a similar offset is applied to NGC 2299 (found by JH on the same sweep), it matches NGC 2302, so this error is quite plausible.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2340 = H II-736 = h433 on 9 Mar 1788 (sweep 815) and called "pF, vS, lbM, resolvable."  His position (CH's reduction) is just off the east edge of the galaxy.  Harold Corwin concludes that H II-862 (found on sweep 990, 28 Dec 1890), although equated with NGC 2332 = h430, is actually a duplicate observation of this galaxy.

The halo is irregularly round, ~50"x45" with a slightly uneven surface brightness and it appears a bit thinner or pinched on the NW side.  Modest contrast gain with a UHC filter at 100x-280x, although this object does not require a filter.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2346 = H IV-65 on 5 Mar 1790 (sweep 935) and recorded "a pretty considerable star, 9 or 10m, visibly affected with vF nebulosity, of very little extent all around. A power of 300 shewed the same, but gave a little more extent to the nebulosity. The 22d Monocerotis was quite free from nebulosity."  CH's reduced position is 1° too far south, but a note was added on the sweep there may be an error of 1°, due to a confusion on the polar distance.


John Herschel didn't report an observation in either his Slough or Cape catalogues. Dreyer observed the PN on 14 Feb 1877 with the 72" at Birr Castle and reported "*9 mag seems nebulous, especially on the n or np side.  At last we agreed that it was nebulous all round.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2347 = H III-746 on 1 Nov 1788 (sweep 879) and recorded, "vF, S, R lbM."  His position, based on Auwers' reduction, is 3.3' N of UGC 3759.  The GC/NGC position (from John Herschel) is 5.7' NNE of UGC 3759.  Finally, Harold Corwin reduced the offsets given in Dreyer's 1912 revision of Herschel's catalogues and that position is 18' NNE of UGC 3759 -- and 9' NE of UGC 3750, the galaxy generally identified as IC 2179.


Bigourdan later observed this field in 1894 and 1900. His position for B. 267 = IC 2179 in Comptes Rendus is 07 15 33 +64 57 (2000), which is an excellent match for UGC 3750.  CGCG, UGC, MOL, DSFG, RC3, PGC and U2000 all label this galaxy as IC 2179.  But, Bigourdan's listing in his complete Observations, etc. for B. 267 corresponds with UGC 3759, the galaxy identified as NGC 2347 in modern catalogues and his listing for NGC 2347 matches UGC 3750 (Corwin notes an error in his identification of the reference star). So, Bigourdan reverses the modern identifications.


The question still remains - which of these two galaxies is WH's III-746?  See Corwin's identification notes for more on this story (also analyzed by Malcolm Thomson).

On the north side of the central region is a 13" pair of mag 11/12 stars with a mag 13 star 16" S forming an easy triple.  The stars are pretty evenly distributed and many are similar magnitudes, though a number appear to be arranged in strings that extend out radially from the center.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2355 = H VI-6 = h439 on 8 Mar 1784 (sweep 161) and reported "a cluster of stars of various magnitudes, pretty much compressed in the middle, and the cluster is pretty rich.  Of an iR form; most of the stars are S and I suppose if it is at all visible in my 7 ft reflector it must assume a nebulous appearance.  To the north of it is a pretty considerable star which my field will take in with the cl."  There is nothing at his position, but 1 min 40 sec of east of his position is this cluster and it fits his description.  Karl Harding independently found the cluster around 1823 and reported it as a new discovery (7 of the 8 objects in his list were previously discovered).

Corwin equates NGC 2356 = NGC 2355 (see description for NGC 2355).  Also about 20' W of Herschel's position are 15 stars in a 3' arrowhead outline.  This asterism is well detached in the field and though not impressive is also a possible candidate.  A nice equilateral triangle of mag 11.5-12.5 stars with sides of 1' form the eastern corner of the group.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2356 = H VII-6 on 16 Mar 1784 (sweep 176) and described "A pretty rich and compressed cluster of stars."  There is nothing at his position (reduced using the offsets given in Dreyer's 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH) but ~15' S is NGC 2355 and Harold Corwin concludes this number is probably a duplicate observation of NGC 2355.  His position for NGC 2355 is not good either -- it's 100 tsec of RA too far west!


Based on photographic plates taken at the Heidelberg Obseratory, Reinmuth adds "no Cl north of NGC 2355, in 7h 8m.0 +14d 13' (1860) a loose clustering of st 11... in triangle." At Reinmuth's position (about 1 tmin preceding the NGC position) is a triangular group which stands out pretty well.  But NGC 2355 is the best fit for NGC 2356.

NGC 2358

Size 20'x15'


18" (3/13/10): gorgeous low power Milky Way field at 72x (63'), though nothing stands out distinctly as cluster-like.  At the given position (07 16.9 -17 07 (2000), is a weak enhancement, roughly 20' diameter, with a nice quardruple group of mag 10-11 stars on the south side.  This field enhancement is only noticeable as the Milky Way is weaker or dusty to the north and south of the group and the background glow brightens near the position of NGC 2358.


Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC and William Herschel's description ""A course scattered cluster of stars, not rich." is not specific enough to pin down his intended "cluster".


William Herschel discovered NGC 2358 = H VIII-45 on 31 Dec 1785 (sweep 503) and noted "A course scattered cluster of stars, not rich., not compressed"  JH did not record an observation of this "cluster" and it was not observed at Birr Castle.  There is a large (~20') Milky Way field (described in my observation) including a number of mag 10 stars close to WH's position.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

NGC 2359 = LBN 1041 = Sh 2-298 = Ced 94b = Gum 4 = RCW 5 = Thor's Helmet = Duck Nebula

07 18 31 -13 13 30; CMa

Size 8'x6'


48" (4/13/10): the 5' central region of Thor's Helmet was mesmerizing at 267x and 330x (unfiltered).  A large, bright knot is at the south end of the rim where the inner portion of the bright wing that heads southwest connects with the central bubble.  Along the northern edge of the rim are three collinear mag 11 stars (2.2' length) oriented E-W. The rim of the bubble is noticeably brighter in a thin arc beginning due north of center (between the two western stars) and extending about 90° clockwise to the west (this portion of Thor's Helmet was catalogued separately as NGC 2361).  The rim is also brighter along a 45° thicker arc on the southeast side.  The rim has a lower surface brightness on the east and NE side and varies in thickness and brightness around the entire bubble.


Three brighter stars (nearly collinear) and several fainter stars are superimposed within the main bubble.  A second, smaller, incomplete bubble just north of center outlines an inner dark "hole", which includes one of the brighter stars.  The 11.4-magnitude ionizing Wolf-Rayet star HD 56925 is at the southwest edge of this inner bubble.  Additional thin wisps of nebulosity criss-cross the central region.


17.5" (12/28/00): "Thor's Helmet" is a remarkably bright, detailed nebulosity at 100x using an OIII filter.  The central region is a 5' bubble (illuminated by a Wolf-Rayet star) with a brighter rim along the west side giving a "C" appearance with irregular knots, filamentary wisps of nebulosity and areas of thinner nebulosity in the interior.  A number of fainter stars are superimposed in the central region along with some brighter mag 11 stars on the north portion of the rim.


The southern "horn" of the helmet is attached at the south end of the bubble and a mag 10.5 star is attached to its SE side.  The brightest portion is a thick 4' extension angling towards the WSW.  As it extends more directly west it thins out into a long 10' streamer.  The northern "horn" of Thor's Helmet" is attached at the northwest end of the central bubble and extends towards the northwest.  This section is fairly long and thick but brighter along a thin spine. A fainter strip of nebulosity also begins on the northeast end of the central mass and extends 10' due east.  Finally, weak nebulosity was also visible to the southeast of the central "helmet".  Illuminated by the Wolf-Rayet star HD 56925 = WR 7.


13.1" (1/28/84): unusual emission nebula, fairly bright, fairly large, about 7'x5'.  A thinner strip extends west of a mag 10.8 star on the south end.  A few fainter stars are superimposed on the north side.  A very faint section is also attached at the NW end extending towards the NW.


13x80mm (1/13/07): the circular central region of Thor's Helmet was easily visible at 13x in my 80mm finder using an OIII filter (24mm Panoptic), though the "horns" of the helmet were not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2359 = H V-21 = h3075 on 31 Jan 1785 (sweep 363) and recorded "A broad elongated nebulosity, in the form of a parallelogram with a short ray southwards from the south preceding corner.  The nebulosity between the milky and resolvable, almost of an equal brightness; but very faint.  The parallelogram about 8' long and 5 or 6' broad, but ill-defined."  He published a sketch in his 1811 paper (Fig. 3) as an illustration "of detached Nebulosity".


John Herschel observed this nebula from the Cape and recorded "a very singular nebula, much like the profile of a bust, (head, neck and shoulders,) or a silhouette portrait, very large, pretty well defined, light nearly uniform, about 12' diameter. In a crowded field of milky way stars, many of which are projected on it."  His RA was exactly 1 minute too small (but accurate in NPD) and this position was copied into the GC and later the NGC.  Howe noted this error when he observed the nebula.  Herschel's sketch (Plate IV, figure 4) shows the silhouette shape well with the shoulders/bust region the brighter "wing". See notes for NGC 2361.  From Malta, William Lassell sketched it similar to a balloon, with a long "neck" twisted in the southwest direction.


Joseph Turner made a more accurate sketch on 24 Jan 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  The main 5' bubble is depected as annular with some interior nebulosity particularly south of the central star.  The main tail was sketched accurately, though it ends before the thin streamer section. The prepared lithograph of the nebula was not published.


I'm surprised NGC 2359 is mentioned in Garrett Serviss' 1901 "Pleasures of the Telescope" written for at most 5-inch telescopes: "In [GC] 1511 we have a faint nebula remarkable for the rows of minute stars in and near it."  And in the 1909 book "In Starland with a 3-inch Telescope", William Olcott repeats "Note the nebula [GC] 1511 and the curving row of faint stars near it."


Based on plate taken with the 60-inch at Mt Wilson in 1917, Pease reported: "Sir John Herschel pictured it as resembling a bust, while Lassell drew it like balloon, with a long neck twisted in the Sp direction.  The balloon or head is approximately 5' in diameter; the neck is to the south, with nebulosity about 1' wide extending 8' west, concave on the north and gradually narrowing and fading out.  From the top (N) of the head a symmetrical streamer concave to the south extends in the western direction...A second streamer about 1' wide extends east from the top of the head to a distance of 9'."

13.1" (1/28/84): includes about 40 fainter stars in an elongated, arrowhead shape with mag 9 SAO 152691 at the east edge (probably a foreground star).  Appears rich with fairly uniform magnitudes.


Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 2360 = H VII-12 = h440 = h3076 on 26 Feb 1783.  NGC 2360 was her first deep sky discovery and occurred before William had begun his sweeps for nebulae.  Perhaps this discovery, along with M93, which she discovered independently earlier that night (and assumed it was new), inspired her brother to search for nebulae starting the next month.


On 4 Feb 1785 (sweep 366) William recorded "a large cluster of pretty compressed scattered stars, near 1/2° in diam, considerably rich, most of the stars of the same size."  On 31 Dec 1785 (sweep 503) he wrote, "A beautiful cluster of pretty compressed stars, very large."  John Herschel recorded it from the Cape of Good Hope on 12 Feb 1836 as the "Middle of a fine large, rich cluster, not compressed to the middle. Stars 9..12th mag; fills field."

48" (4/15/10): Along the northern edge of the rim of Thor's Helmet are three collinear mag 11 stars (2.2' length) oriented E-W. The rim of the bubble is noticeably brighter in a thin arc beginning due north of center (between the two western stars) and extending about 90° clockwise to the west.  Bigourdan's NGC 2361 refers to this brighter portion of the Wolf-Rayet nebula.  See observing notes for NGC 2359  for a complete description of the nebula.


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 2361 = Big. 27 on 25 Feb 1887.  Harold Corwin identifies NGC 2361 with a bright knot along the west side of the main bubble of NGC 2359.  Wolfgang Steinicke lists Wilhelm Tempel as a co-discoverer (in 1887), though he is not credited in the NGC.

V = 4.1;  Size 8'


13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica): gorgeous low power field surrounding Tau CMa using the 20 Nagler (75x).  Tau was easily resolved into a triple with two mag 10 and 11.2 companions at 8.5" and 14" to the east.  At 170x, 75-80 stars are visible and the cluster appears fully resolved.  A string of stars passes to the north of Tau oriented NW to SE.  Several faint stars and a detached clump lie to the north of Tau beyond the string.  A mag 8.5 star marks the south border of the cluster.


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): stunning open cluster at 105x surrounding Tau Canis Majoris which is a very close triple star.  Perhaps 75 stars are resolved in a well-detached 6' region.


17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, this is a gorgeous, uniformly rich cluster surrounding Tau CMa, which is offset north of center. A WNW-ESE string of stars north of Tau gives a flattened border and the rich southern portion tapers to the south giving a triangular appearance.  At 220x, ~60 stars are visible in a 6' diameter, many of 10.5-11.  Just following the central star to the ESE are two mag 11 companions.  Several other fainter stars are in the central core including one fairly close preceding.


17.5" (2/28/87): about 75 stars in 6' diameter surrounding Tau Canis Majoris (V = 4.4) in an unusually rich, impressive cluster!  Tau is resolved into several components.


13.1": 50 stars in a triangular-shape surrounding Tau Canis Majoris, very rich, impressive.


Giovanni Hodierna probably discovered NGC 2362 = H VII-17 = h441 = h3077 around 1654 (marked on a map of Canis Major).  It was discovered again by William Herschel on 4 Mar 1783 before starting his sweeps, with his 6.2-inch reflector.  He found it again on 6 Mar 1785 (sweep 381) and described it as "a most beautiful cluster of pretty large stars with one of the 7th magnitude in the center, which however I suppose does not belong to it."  John Herschel observed the cluster from both Slough and the Cape of Good Hope, where he recorded "a fine cluster of discrete stars, 60 or 70 in number. R, gbM, 8' diameter." It's surprising this bright cluster wasn't found by one of Messier's contemporaries.

48" (4/15/10): NGC 2363 is either a small satellite galaxy of NGC 2366 or possibly a detached star cloud or galaxy west of the southwest end of NGC 2366.  At 330x, NGC 2363 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 or 5:2 SW-NE, with a low but irregular surface brightness.  Located ~2.2' SW of the center of NGC 2366 and 1.2' W of the bright knot.  The bright HII knot/starburst region in NGC 2366 is often misidentified as NGC 2363.


A 2010 study suggests NGC 2363 was very close to the southern tip of NGC 2366 less than 10 Myr ago, and could have triggered the interaction which has led to the strong episodes of star formation in the southern half of NGC 2366 as well as this galaxy.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 2363 on 9 Mar 1874 with the 72" while observing NGC 2366 = H III-748.  He noted a "diffused nebulosity preceding, pos. 265.9°, dist 71.4"."  Copeland's offsets were measured with respect to the unusually bright HII knot at the southwest end of the galaxy, which has always been assumed to be NGC 2363.  But Copeland's "diffused nebulosity preceding" refers to UGC 3847, a separate galaxy ( or isolated star cloud) just west of the southwest end of NGC 2366.


CGCG misidentifies NGC 2363 as the "bright emission patch at the SW end of NGC 2366" and RNGC misclassifies NGC 2363 as nonexistent with the comment "Patch in NGC 2366, Zwicky".  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for the complete story.

Both groups have strings of faint stars extending to the north beyond a mag 9.5 star located ~5' N of the main groups.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC, although the group is fairly distinctive.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2364 = h442 on 8 Jan 1831 (sweep 318) and noted "Two small pretty close groups of pL stars in the milky way, rather a remarkable cl."  There are two strings of stars at JH's position, matching his description.  RNGC classifies this object as nonexistent (Type 7).


William Herchel apparently made the original discovery on 24 Feb 1786 (sweep 529) and noted "Clustering stars, in three short parallel lines, the two last whereof are joined to the sp; the placed taken is that of the middle lane."  He didn't assign it an internal discovery number, so it wasn't included in his catalogues.

48" (4/15/10): The most striking feature of NGC 2366 is a prominent double knot (giant HII/starburst complex) at the SW end (also known as Mrk 71 amd NGC 2366-I).  At 330x, the knot appeared very bright, elongated 3:2 E-W, ~18"x12", with two overlapping components (super star clusters A and B).  A fainter and smaller knot (NGC 2366-II) was easily visible 15" E, for a total of 3 HII knots.


NGC 2363, a low surface brightness companion or detached OB association/HII region, lies 1.2' W of the bright double knot.  At 330x it appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 or 5:2 SW-NE, with a low but irregular surface brightness.


18" (3/19/04): at the SW end of the galaxy is a very bright knot (HII region), roughly mag 12.5 and perhaps 15" in size which responds to a UHC filter at 160x!  At 323x this knot is irregular in shape (~20"x15", SW-NE) and brightness and at moments resolves into two or three components.  The galaxy itself is fairly faint, large, and very elongated SSW-NNE, 3.5'x1.0', with a low surface brightness.


13.1" (1/11/86): fairly faint, very large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, low almost even surface brightness.  An unusually bright HII region is at the SW end of the galaxy (2' from the center) and appears as a "fuzzy" 12th magnitude star.  Although very small, it appeared elongated SW-NE and similar to a poorly resolved double star.  Definite contrast gain with OIII filter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2366 = H III-748 on 3 Dec 1788 (sweep 889) and called it "vF, vS, stellar.  300 confirmed it and showed a vF branch to the nf."  His description and position matches the prominent HII region at the southwest end of the galaxy.  The "vf branch nf" refers to the actual galaxy.  So, NGC 2366 applies to the HII region (also known as Mrk 71) as well as the galaxy.  Modern sources misidentify the large HII knot as NGC 2363.  See historical comments for NGC 2363.


Ralph Copeland described it on 9 Mar 1874 with the 72" as a "diffused neby preceding, pos 265.9°, dist 71.4"  Neb * or neb knot post 318°, dist 77.6".  The object has a curved tail, pos 30.9°, convex on the following side, traced 9' or 10'.  The neb knot preceding is connected with the principal enbulosity.  Line of stars spp, curved towards preceding side, nebulous?  At least the enbula appears to extend so far on spp side.  [See Pl I.]."

48" (4/1/11 and 3/1/19): I was stunned by the view of this bipolar nebula. There was so much intricate detail in NGC 2371/72 that there was little resemblance to previous views through my 17.5" and 18" scopes.  The most prominent feature is a pair of irregularly round, very bright nodules on the southwest and northeast side of the boxy, elongated central region.  Each nodule was distinctive and varied in surface brightness and shape with the southwest lobe brighter.  Filamentary streamers or a "hairy tail" extended from the northeast node towards the northwest and similar wisps extended mainly southeast from the southwest node, creating a sense of rotation around the fairly bright central star (mag 14.9). The interior and sides were filled with much fainter nebulosity.  A very faint filament connected the main lobes on the northwest edge.  Two amazing outer wings (similar in visibility) are detached from the main 1' structure and symmetrically hang 1' NW and 1' SE from the central star.  These wings or "polar caps" were easily visible without a filter at 488x and both extended ~40"x10" in a SW-NE orientation, increasing the total diameter of the planetary to 2'.  A mag 13.5 star lies 1.5' NW (beyond the NW wing) and a mag 16 star is 50" NE of center.


24" (4/13/18): at 220x and NPB filter; the detached NW outer wing (1' from center) was faint but not difficult as an extended strip of nebulosity ~30"x10", oriented SSW-NNE.  A mag 13.8 star is outside the wing to the west [1.5' from center]. The slightly fainter trailing wing required averted vision to glimpse, but is symmetrically placed 1' SE of center and well detached from the central bi-polar body.


17.5" (2/14/99): very unusual appearance at 380x with two bright knots oriented SW-NE about 30" between centers and 0.9' in total length.  The southwest knot is 15"-20" in size, slightly elongated and the brighter of the two.  The northeast condensation has a slightly lower surface brightness and appears ~20" in diameter.  The faint mag 14.9 central star is symmetrically placed between the knots.  Weaker nebulosity connects the two knots giving a "dogbone" appearance with a very faint rounder halo encasing the structure!


17.5" (2/13/88): unusual planetary, bright, moderately large, elongated SW-NE.  Two bright knots are at both ends (with two NGC designations) although the SW end is brighter and concentrated.


13.1" (2/25/84): two condensations in halo.  The WSW side is brighter and sharper.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2371 = H II-316 = h444, along with NGC 2372, on 12 Mar 1785 (sweep 385) and reported, "Two. F, of an equal size.  Both small within a minute of each other; each has a seeming nucleus, and their apparent atmospheres run into each other.  240 showed the same position from sp to nf."  He published a sketch in his 1811 paper (Fig. 6) as an illustration of "double Nebulae with joined Nebulosity."


On 17 Feb 1827 (sweep 57), John Herschel called NGC 2371 "the south-preceding of a curious bright double neb or an elongated bicentral neb; nuclei approaching to stars 45° nf or sp - distance of centre 60".  See fig 72."


Lord Rosse or assistant Johnstone Stoney made the first observation with the 72" on 19 Dec 1848 and logged a "bright star between, tails and curved filaments, perhaps an annulus round the two nebulae."  A sketch was made (probably by Stoney) three nights later.  William Lassell made an observation in March 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector from Malta.  He noted the "preceding one [nebula] is the brightest" and made a sketch (figure IX in his 1854 MRAS paper).   Using his 48-inch on 24 Mar 1862 from Malta, he sketched the two ansae as outer symmetrical arcs.


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported the "Brightest portion consists of two lobes which together form an irregular and patchy oval.  The brightest part of these lobes are 35" apart in pa 65°; the toal diameter in this direction is 54".  Two very faint, curved outliers are each 60" distant in the prolongation of the major axis in pa 126-306°.  A narrow vacant lane runs between the lobes, nearly in the major axis, and widens to include the central star."  The emission spectrum (PN) was first found by Campbell and Moore).

His micrometric offsets from GC 1530 = NGC 2388 (342" in PA 103°) points to a close double (mag ~14.5/15.5 at 3") with a third mag 14.5 star at 18".

Size 8"


24" (2/22/14): at 125x, this 7" double star generally appeared as an unresolved quasi-stellar glow and it was easy to see how it could be mistaken as a possible nebula.  At 200x, it was often cleanly resolved, but still the fainter companion is dim enough to often appear not as a sharp star, but a very faint "appendage" to the brighter component, mimicking a tiny nebula. Also, there are 3 mag 15-16 stars closeby [within 25"] that perhaps contribute to noticing this pair.  At 260x and above, the pair was nearly always resolved cleanly.


CGCG 177-023, the galaxy identified as NGC 2387 in the CGCG, RNGC and PGC, appeared very faint, small, round, low even surface brightness, 15" diameter.  An extremely faint companion 25" SE was not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2387 = H II-820 on 10 Mar 1790 (sweep 937) and recorded "pB, S, stellar.  The wind too high to verify it."  There is nothing at his position, but Harold Corwin suggests Herschel most likely picked up a faint double only 1.5' north of his position (based on Auwers' reduction).  This pair looked like a tiny nebula in my scope at 200x.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey at Heidelberg, describes NGC 2387 as a single mag 13.5 star with "a small group of 5 small stars nnp 3'."  Corwin's double is part of these "5 small stars".


Dreyer took CGCG 177-023 as H II-820 on his 23 Feb 1876 observation with the 72": "Irr R, probably lE pf, looks like a hazy star.  Forms a rectangular triangle with a *16 sf and a *17 nff about 2' distant.  3 st 14-15m preceding in a curved line, the nearest one in Pos 279.5°, 161.2"."   This galaxy is ~25 sec of RA west and 8' N of WH's position and his description and class (II) does not fit this galaxy.  RNGC, CGCG and PGC also misidentify CGCG 177-023 as NGC 2387. So, assuming WH's observation refers to the double star, CGCG 177-023 is left without a NGC designation.  Also, see Harold Corwin's comments.

V = 9.2;  Size 47"x43"


48" (4/1/11): I just took a quick look at the Eskimo at 488x but the view of the double green shells was stunning.  The inner, brilliant annulus is irregularly shaped, with an elongated bulge on the north side.  The ring essentially splits into two sections at the north end (the inner "ring" is fainter) with a darker interior forming a small pouch within the ring.  This feature could be considered the "chin" at the bottom of the Eskimo's "face" in the eyepiece view.  The outer shell is irregularly lit and brighter along the southern rim.


18" (2/24/06): viewed at 807x in good seeing. This remarkable double-shelled planetary has a darker ring around the bright, 9th magnitude central star. The darker ring is surrounded by fairly narrow bright annulus, perhaps 20" in diameter.  The rim of the inner annulus appears slightly brighter along the western half and brightest along the northwest section.  Moving outwards, a narrow darker ring separates the inner shell from a large, lower surface brightness outer halo that extends to nearly 1' in diameter (listed diameter is only 47").


17.5" (12/19/87): using 410x exhibits a prominent double shell structure with a very bright inner shell about 20" diameter with a darker central hole surrounding a very bright mag 9 central star.  The Eskimo has a very high surface brightness with a bluish color and easily takes this magnification.  The inner shell is surrounded by a thin dark ring about 2/3 of the way out from center and a faint, barely detached outer halo.  Located 1.6' S of mag 8.3 SAO 79428.


13.1" (1/28/84): bright mag 9 central star surrounded by a double shell with a bright inner disk and a dark ring separates the two shells.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2392 = H IV-45 = h450 on 17 Jan 1787 (sweep 694) and recorded "a star with a pretty strong milky nebulosity equally dispersed all around.  The star about 9m.  Having but just began I suspected the glass to be covered with damp, or my eye not yet to be in order; however a star 10 or 11m just north of it was free from the same appearance.  A very curious phenomenon; like my northern Planetary in its growing state."  The next night he added "One of the most remarkable phenomena I ever have seen."  In the 1814 PT paper he used this object as an example of an evident connection between an atmosphere and a star.


The annularity of NGC 2392 was discovered by George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, on 20 Feb 1849.  Stoney's sketch (figure 15, plate XXXVIII in the 1850 PT paper) also shows a dark spot just to the right (west?) of the central star.  William Lassell reported similar structure with his 24-inch in Jan 1853: "The nebulous star has its envelope evidently fainter on the preceding side.  Its circular outline is almost wanting there. About half-way between the centre and circumference there is a narrow, concentric, dark ring, within which the nebula is brighter than the exterior portion." His sketch was published in his 1854 MRAS paper (figure 6) on observations from Malta.


Using an 18.2-inch silvered-glass reflector Henry Cooper Key reported, "the present appearance of this object, as seen in my instrument, is that of a bright, but somewhat nebulous star closely surrounded by a dark ring; this again by a luminous ring; then an interval much less luminous, and, finally, at some distance, an exterior luminous ring" (1867MNRAS..28....2A). Father Secchi also sketched the double ring structure with the 9.5" refractor in Rome around 1856 as well as Barnard with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory on 10 Apr 1890.  He reported "a condensed point or 2 in the preceding part [of the inner disc], then there seems to be a dark vacuity about this disc and then a fainter nebulous ring.  It is a remarkable object."

NGC 2394

18" (3/13/04): at 115x, appears as a 15'x5' scattered group of roughly two dozen stars, extended E-W.  Includes a about a dozen mag 10-11 stars.  The stars appear to be arranged in a zig-zag chain which is fairly distinctive.  Additional stars are scattered to the north and south of this string.   But NGC 2394 may be just a random grouping.  Located just 10' NE of Eta CMi (V = 5.3) in the same field!


William Herschel discovered NGC 2394 = H VIII-44 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 496) and noted "A cluster of very coarse scattered large stars, they form a cross and extend over a large space; not rich."  There were no observations made by JH or at Birr Castle.  Based on Heidelberg plates, Karl Reinmuth described NGC 2394 as "a very loose clustering of pB st, bet BD+7d1729 and BD+7d1739."  There are about 15 fairly bright mag 10-11 stars in the vicinity.  RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (Type 7).

William Herschel discovered NGC 2395 = H VIII-11 on 16 Mar 1784 (sweep 176) and noted "a cluster of scattered stars."  There is nothing at the Caroline's reduced position (or the GC/NGC position), but 30' southwest is this scattered group of stars.  Auwers' reduced position is 1° too far south, so he made a reduction error.  Still, this is an unusually large error, though the cluster was found only 3 months after WH began his sweeps and his positions are sometimes off quite a bit in his early sweeps.  Caroline Herschel also noted a confusion in the sweep record about the offset star -- whether it was 50 or 51 Geminorum, so perhaps there is still an error to be uncovered.

A chain of stars extends a few arcminutes NE from the mag 8.5 star and then abruptly loops due south for the same distance.  This chain then curves around making a large oval loop forming the east side of the cluster.  Located 10' S of a triple star (ADS 6104) consisting of a mag 8.5 primary with mag 8.5 and 9.5 companions at 20" and 23".  The brighter two stars have an orange/blue color contrast.

George Bond discovered NGC 2399 = HN 9, along with NGC 2400, on 26 Feb 1853 with the 15-inch Merz refractor during the Harvard Zone Survey of stars near the celestial equator.  He noted "between stars #230 and #231 there are two faint nebulae.  Dec +00 05 11 [1853]." Near Bond's position in AN #1453 is a 10" +/- pair of mag 14/15 stars with a third component at 20".  Heinrich d'Arrest measured both NGC 2399 and 2340 on 30 Jan 1865, but his positions are 1 minute of RA too large and he didn't resolve these multiple stars.

48" (4/15/10): this amazing multi-arm spiral stretched across the entire 15' field at 330x, with the major axis running NW to SE.  A striking prominent spiral arm is attached near the NW end and sweeps counter-clockwise 180° along the northern side of the galaxy, tapering as it extends to a point roughly 5' SE of the core.  The arm is widest near the NW end, where it begins sweeping east.  A second inner arm attaches near the SE end of the main body and tightly hugs the southern side of the galaxy as sweeps to the NW side.  A more ill-defined branch heads west from the SE end past a mag 11 star situated 2' WSW of the core.  The field was too small to trace out the outer arms.  Numerous HII splotches stained the surface and I only had time to quickly sketch the most obvious knots.


The supergiant HII complex NGC 2404 located 1.7' ENE of the core and 1.5' NNW of a superimposed mag 10.5 star, appeared as a very bright, irregular, 20" knot.  Hodge lists NGC 2404 as A67 in his 1985 paper "Stellar Associations in the Galaxy NGC 2403".  On the NW side of the galaxy is a collinear string of 3 stars oriented NE to SW with an obvious collinear knot an additional 50" SW (SPC-44 in Sivan, Petit and Comte's 1990 "Optical HII Regions in NGC 2403"; VS 3 in Véron and Sauvayre; and A14 in Hodge).  Just north of the core are two HII knots, separated by 45" and both 12" in size.  The western knot is catalogued as SPC-174 = VS 24 = A36 and the eastern knot as SPC-224 = VS 38 = A45 .


On the SE side of the galaxy is a pair of HII knots separated by 40".  The eastern knot is SP-346 = VS 51 = A80 and is situated 1.6' SE of the mag 10.5 star and the western knot includes SPC-318/321/322.  At the SE end of the spiral arm that contains NGC 2404 is another 10" knot, which includes SPC-348/351/352 = VS 52 = A81.  It can be pinpointed 1.0' NE of the mag 10.5 star.  On the SE end of the galaxy a fairly faint, irregular knot (SPC-331/336/343 = VS 48/49 = A73) was noticed 1' W of a mag 14 star.


18" (3/19/04): at 160x, this chaotic spiral displayed a tremendous wealth of detail with two broad, diffuse spiral arms, dark lanes, mottling and a few obvious giant HII regions.  A number of stars are superimposed including two mag 11 stars.  I focused on observing the HII regions that were best viewed at 323x.


The brightest is the HII complex NGC 2404 (VS 44 = SP 298)  on the east side of the core 1.5' from center and 1.5' N of a mag 11 star to the SW of the core.  This knot is fairly bright at 323x, perhaps 15" diameter and irregularly round.


On the NW side of the halo is a collinear string of two stars along with a fuzzy knot (VS 3 = SP 44 = A14), oriented from SW to NE.  This HII knot forms the SW end of the string and is clearly nonstellar at 323x, ~15" diameter.  It can also be pinpointed 2.4' NW of the mag 11 star west of the core (middle of three in a E-W string).


At the NNW edge of the core is a mag 13.5 "star" that does not focus sharply and appears to be another HII knot (VS 24 = SPC-174 = A36).  Close following is a fainter, but definite nonstellar knot ~10" diameter (VS 38 = SPC-224 = A45).


Finally, returning to star on the SW edge of the core, a fainter mag 14 star is close south with a weak nebulous glow attached (SPC-221/222/225).  This region is also catalogued as A41 in Hodge's 1985 "Stellar Associations in the Galaxy NGC 2403" from PASP, 97, 1065 .


17.5" (2/28/87): very bright, very large, bright core, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 15'x6'.  Impressive galaxy with spiral structure clearly visible.  Two spiral arms are attached at opposite ends of the central region and both wind almost 180°.  The tip of the northern arm ends at the emission nebula NGC 2404.  Several stars are superimposed including two mag 11 stars.


17.5" (2/22/87): two spiral arms are visible on attached at the opposite sides of the galaxy and winding a half of revolution.  The northern arm ends at the HII knot NGC 2404.  The galaxy has a mottled appearance.


13.1" (1/11/86): spiral arm definite on the west side of the galaxy with a dark gap between this arm and the main body (core).  This feature is very faint but definite with averted.


13.1" (12/22/84): spiral arm highly suspected attached at the west side winding along the north side to a faint knot = NGC 2404.


13.1" (1/28/84): very bright, large bright core.  NGC 2404 is clearly visible as a faint, very small nebulous knot along the east side of the galaxy.  Spiral structure (arms) is just suspected.  On 3/24/84 the knot was difficult to view at 144x, but on 1/11/86 was fairly easy.


8" (1/1/84): bright, large, bright core, faint star superimposed, mottled?


William Herschel discovered NGC 2403 = H V-44 on 1 Nov 1788 (sweep 879) and recorded "cB; R; vgbM; BN; 6 or 7' dia; resembling a star with a misty atmosphere." His summary description, also based on a later observation, states "with a faint branch extending a great way to the np side; not less than 1/2 degree; and to the n or nf the nebulosity diffused over a space, I am pretty sure, not less than a whole degree."  Obviously, his size estimate is well off, but his description of a "faint branch extending a great way to the np side" applies to the spiral side on the west side and the comment "to the n or nf the nebulosity is diffused over a space" probably applies to the northern arm that extends to the east (and contains NGC 2404).


Based on photographs taken with the 60-inch reflector at Mt Wilson, Francis Pease (1917) remarked "This fine right-handed spiral nebula resembles M33...Faint knots and arms extend as far as 10' from the center.  It does not contains the wealth of detail of M33, but has the same sharp stellar images, the nebulous stars [HII regions], the bunching of these knots and the dark streaks.."

Truman Safford discovered NGC 2410 = Sf 74 on 5 Feb 1867 with the 18.5" refractor at the Dearborn Observatory and recorded "pS, pB, vmb M N = 12-13m."  Safford's discovery, though, was not published until 1887, too late to be credited in the NGC.  Stephan independently found the galaxy on 2 Feb 1877, recorded it in list VIIIb-20, and was credited with the discovery in the GC Supplement (5388) and the NGC.  It was later found again by Stephane Javelle on 11 Feb 1898 and described in list III-1005 as "F, E 250 deg, 1' long, gbM, r."

18" (3/13/04): appears as two groups of stars symmetrically placed to the north and south of mag 8.7 HD 60307.  The southern group is richer and contains nearly three dozen stars within 5'.  The northern group contains more mag 10-11 stars but is not as rich with two dozen stars in 7'.  This group is probably not a true cluster.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2413 = H VIII-52 on 19 Mar 1786 (sweep 540) and called it "a cluster of vL coarsely scattered stars, not rich, nearly R."  His position is 1.5' north of mag 8.8 HD 60307, on the south side of the group.


JH did not reobserve this object but it was described at Birr Castle on 3 Jan 1873 as a "very loose Cl, scarcely more compressed than the neighborhood."  Brian Skiff notes two clumps in a 10' diameter.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

Framed by a quadrilateral of four mag 13-14 stars and a few other faint stars.  Collinear with mag 7.0 SAO 60232 4' W and mag 7.9 SAO 60229 8' W.  The "Intergalactic Tramp" is one of most distant globulars from earth and may be the core of an accreted dwarf galaxy.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2419 = H I-218 = h457 on 31 Dec 1788 (sweep 901) and wrote "cB, R, vgmbM, about 3' diameter."  John Herschel described the globular on 18 Mar 1831(sweep 335) as "not vB; L; pmE in parallel; 2' l and 75" br."  This is an interesting observation as the globular is generally described as round.  The first time it was logged at Birr Castle on 9 Mar 1850, Lord Rosse remarked "I think clearly resolved, several points, at least 3 seen plainly in edge which I suspect to be filamentous; no nucl., more round than h[erschel] describes it."  The 13 Feb 1852 observation even notes "Lord Rosse thought it like a cluster at a great distance."


NGC 2419 was shown to be globular cluster in 1922 on a plate taken at Lowell Observatory.  Shapley estimated a distance of 160,000 l.y. (current estimate ~275,000 l.y., nearly twice the distance of the LMC) and along with Sawyer, assigned it concentration class II.  He may have been the first to use the nickname "Intergalactic Tramp" in the 1944 paper "Revision of the Distances of 30 high-latitude Globular Clusters."

18" (3/15/10): this is a rich, pretty group at low power with roughly 80-100 stars in a 10' region at 175x.  Higher power brings out the fainter members.  The brightest mag 9.4 star is at the west end of the cluster and forms a large mag contrast pair with a 13th companion 12" south.  On the north end of the cluster is an equally spaced, collinear trio with separations of 14".  The brighter stars in the cluster are pretty evenly distributed.  Many of the fainter stars are in a 2'-3' patch that follows the mag 9.4 star and which includes some unresolved haze.  A couple of brighter mag 8-9 stars are in the field to the south of the cluster and also to the north.

The group is well-detached in the field, particularly on the west, north and southeast sides.  One concentration of stars is on the soiuthwest side.  Just to the northeast, a number of the cluster's stars form the outline of a large, equilateral triangle.  A rich clump of stars is the center of this triangle including a mag 11/11.5 pair at 18".

Caroline Herschel independently discovered M47 = NGC 2422 = H VIII-38 = h459 = h3088 on 26 Feb 1783.  William Herschel found the cluster again on 4 Feb 1785 (sweep 366) and recorded "a very coarsely scattered cluster of several vL and other different sized stars."  His summary description (including a second observation) reads "a cluster of pretty compressed large and small stars, round, above 15' diameter."  From the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel wrote, "a very large, pretty rich splendid cluster, which more than fills the field. Place of the chief star a find double star."


Giovanni Hodierna probably was the first to discover M47 before 1654 and simply recorded "a Nebulosa between the two dogs".  Charles Messier rediscovered it 117 years later on 19 Feb 1771, though he clearly made an error as there is nothing at his position.  Messier's missing object was assigned GC 1594 and NGC 2478.  In 1959, Canadian amateur T.F. Morris identified M47 as identical to NGC 2422.  See notes for NGC 2478.

13.1" (1/18/85): ~35 faint stars in an elongated string along one side of bright trapezoid of stars.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2432 = H VI-36 = h3092 on 4 Mar 1790 (sweep 934) and described a "very compressed cluster of small, and some large stars; extended nearly in the meridian; the most compressed part is about 8' long and 2' broad, with many stars scattered around it to a considerable distance."  In his 1814 PT paper, Herschel speculated "the construction of this cluster may have arisen from the situation of many stars in the same plane, drawn towards a centre by the clustering power, for any plane seen obliquely will have the appearance of an extended form."  From the Cape of Good Hope, JH called this "a rather irregular cluster of 8th class, pretty much compressed. The most compressed part forms a ridge or body of stars elongated in the meridian. Stars 12..15th mag with larger outliers."

24" (1/28/17): at 375x; two of the components of this faint, close triple star were resolved.  The brightest (mag ~14.8) is at the north end, with a mag 15 component just 5" SE.  At 450x, the third component (mag 15.6) was occasionally resolved 5" south of the northern star.  So, the three stars formed a tiny equilateral triangle of sides 5"!


John Herschel discovered NGC 2433 = h462 on 19 Jan 1828 (sweep 123) and logged "eF, has a *15 90" dist 30 deg [north-preceding]."

About 3' west of his position is a faint pair of mag 14.4/15.4 stars with a separation of 8" that could be his object.  The mean position of these two stars given here.  But Harold Corwin notes that JH's position is exactly 1.0 min of RA east and 1 degree south of NGC 2431 and the description matches the bright core.

17.5" (3/16/96): At 100x, M46 fills a large portion of the field and there are a few hundred stars fairly evenly distributed in a 35' field.  The cluster appears slightly elongated E-W although there are no clear borders. There is no increase in concentration towards the center and except for two brighter stars on the west side the cluster is unusually uniform in brightness (mag 11-13) and distribution in the main body.  There is a noticeable 2' void, though, very close to the center of the cluster.  Around the periphery the distribution becomes quite scraggly and the cluster mixes with the general field density.  The beautiful annular planetary NGC 2438 is situated in the north side of the cluster.


8": bright, very rich, large, includes a couple of mag 9 stars but most stars are mag 10-13 and fairly uniform in magnitude and distribution except for a gap near the center.  Contains the striking pn NGC 2438 at the NE edge.  Faint naked-eye object in a dark sky.


Charles Messier discovered M46 = NGC 2437 = h463 on 19 Feb 1771.  Caroline Herschel found it again on 4 Mar 1783 and assumed it was new, realizing her mistake on 19 Nov.  William Herschel described the cluster (unpublished) on 19 Mar 1786 as "a beautiful, very rich, compressed cluster of stars of various magnitudes."  On 17 Dec 1827 (sweep 111), John Herschel logged, "the brightest part of a v fine rich cl; stars = 10m; which fills the field.  Within the cluster at its n edge is a fine planetary nebula [NGC 2438]."

48" (2/20/12): at 488x, much of the same detail described in the 4/15/10 observation was seen, although the ring itself was less structured.  Besides the slightly off-center bright star (the ionizing star is a mag 17.5-18 companion) and a mag 14.5 star ~15" SW, a 16th mag star is at the edge of the rim on the SW side.  A mag 16 star on the SE side appears just inside the bright ring.  Finally another 16th mag star is near the north edge of the annulus, but clearly within the planetary, for a total of 5 interior stars.  The outer rim brightens at this point in a 90° arc to the east and is slightly flattened.  The challenging Calabash Nebula (protoplanetary) lies 6.5' ENE.


48" (4/15/10): at 700x, NGC 2438 was a beautiful "cheerio" ring with a sharply defined rim of 1.2' diameter and a fairly large, dark central hole of 25-30".  The mag 12.8 star in the center was prominent with a second mag 14.5 star ~15" SW of center.  A third mag 16 star was just inside the annulus on the SE side, ~20" from center.  The rim had a very uneven surface brightness with an impression of some radial streaks and one or two additional faint, embedded stars.  The rim was noticeably brighter along the NE quadrant and to a slightly lesser extent along the opposite SW portion of the rim, creating a bipolar appearance.  A bright mag 11 star is just off the SE side and the planetary floats in the beautifully rich star field of M46.


18" (2/24/06): beautiful view of this 70" planetary within M46 at 323x.  The annulus is quite prominent and relatively thick with a weakly glowing interior.  The rim is irregularly lit and a bit weaker on the NW side and brighter along the eastern edge.  A mag 12.8 star is just NW of the center of the annulus (this is not the central star, though) and a fainter interior star (mag 14?) on the SW side (half-way to the rim) was also visible.  A mag 11 star is just off the SE edge.  At 807x, the rim is noticeably brighter and thicker on the eastern half compared to a weaker section along the NW side and an extremely faint star intermittently pops out on the NNE side on inner edge of the annulus (confirmed on 3/4/08 at Lake Sonoma).


17.5" (3/2/02): at 280x this is a beautiful, 1' diameter PN with a darker central hole at 280x situated on the NE side of the rich oc M46.  A mag 13 star (not the central star) is within the central hole slightly offset NW of center.  The rim is fairly uniform but slightly brighter along the NE side.  The 20" central hole is clearly darker although there is not a dramatic contrast.  A brighter mag 11 star is just off the SE edge (about 15"-20" SW of the mag 11 star, a faint mag 14-15 star was also intermittently visible) and a string of faint stars oriented WNW-ESE is just over 1' S.  M 1-18 is located 22' NNE of NGC 2438.


13.1" (1/18/85): star near center very easy and second interior star definite.


13.1" (1/28/84): annular planetary on the NE side of M46!  Fairly bright, moderately large, round, 1.0' diameter.  A mag 11 star is just off the SE edge and a mag 13 star is just NW of the geometric center (this is not the central star).  A third extremely faint star lies on the SW side.


13.1" (11/5/83): clearly annular at 166x.


8" (1/1/84): slightly darker center, fairly small, round.


80mm (1/15/07): visible continuously in the finder using an OIII filter and a 13mm Nagler (25x) as a very faint, very small disc on the NE side of M46.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2438 = H IV-39 = h464 = h3093 on 19 Mar 1786 (sweep 540) and recorded "pB, R, resolvable, within the 46th of [Messier], almost of an equal light throughout, about 2' diameter, no connection with the cluster, which is everywhere free from nebulosity."  On 8 Mar 1793 (sweep 1034) he noted "A round, pretty well defined nebula; almost of a planetary nebula aspect."  From South Africa, John Herschel wrote, "a very fine planetary nebula, oval, uniform in light, and of a very flat appearance; rather faint; diam in RA = 4 seconds; has a star 15th mag on it, and one 13th mag close to its border. This object is excentrically situated in a superb cluster of stars 12..16th mag. (46 Messier)"


Lord Rosse or assistant Johnstone Stoney sketched NGC 2438 as annular on 22 Dec 1848 (figure 12 in the 1850 PT paper).  It was observed a total of 21 times at Birr Castle including with a visual spectroscope on 15 Feb 1876.  William Lassell also noted the annularity using his 24" equatorial reflector on 11 Jan 1853: "The star is not in the centre, and the nebula seems to retreat from the star, leaving it on a much darker ground than the external parts of the nebula.  With slight attention another star is seen; and two or three points or bright spots in the nebula occasionally catch the eye."  His sketch was published in his 1854 MRAS paper (figure 5) on observations from Malta.  Perhaps following Lassell's lead, Secchi sketched in 1856 the "central star" slightly eccentric, along with a second interior star using the 9.5" refractor in Rome.


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported "the nebula is a very irregular, broad, patchy ring 68" in diameter.  The star at SW lies in a gap in the ring."


This planetary is not physically associated with M46 based on differing radial velocities and the youthful age of cluster and is probably superimposed in foreground).  Les Dalrymple states a distance of 4500 l.y. for the cluster and only 3000 l.y for the planetary in a S&T article (Dec 2002).

About 1' SW and 2' SSE of R Puppis are two easy but prominent double stars equally spaced with similar magnitudes but with perpendicular orientations (N-S and E-W).  The pair 1.7' SSE is PRO 41 (9.2/10.3 at 12"). These wide double stars form a striking group and are part of an elliptical outline of stars with a void in center.  Very unusual appearance!

48" (2/20/12): the view of this explosive appearing planetary was remarkably detailed at 488x and 814x.  The very high surface brightness central region was irregularly shaped with a very ragged periphery, giving the impression that the central region was erupting or bursting.  Within the east side of the central portion are two intense condensations or knots, oriented ~N-S, with the southern knot brighter.  A third, smaller elongated knot is just west and sits close to the center.  The main body is elongated nearly 2:1 SW-NE, roughly 1.1'x0.6', but with an irregular outline.  The southwest end of the planetary dims and protrudes out, creating a cup-shaped hollow with a very small brighter knot at its southwest tip.  A prominent partial loop or outer wing is attached on the northwest edge of the central section, like a spiral arm, and swings clockwise to the west and slightly south. The eastern portion of the planetary consists of a large complete, irregular loop (darker in the interior), giving the strong appearance of being blown out from the central region.


17.5" (2/14/99): this bi-polar planetary reveals fascinating detail at 380x!  The compact high surface brightness inner region is elongated NNW-SSE.  Two bright knots comprise both ends and the surface brightness is irregular.  The nebulosity is much weaker SW of the main body with a cup-shaped dark "notch" protruding into this central bar.  The outer halo is oriented SW-NE with a brighter wing similar to a spiral arm attached at the west edge which swings back towards the south.  The outer nebulosity is weaker and less well-defined on the north and NE sides.


13" (2/23/85): very bright and small with a very high surface brightness.  This planetary has a double shell structure with an elongated box-shape oriented NW-SE and a fainter shell oriented SW-NE.  One or two condensations are visible in the central part.  Located 3.0' W of mag 8.4 orange HD 62167.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2440 = H IV-64 = h3095 on 4 Mar 1790 (sweep 934) and described a "beautiful planetary nebula of a considerable degree of brightness, but not very well defined.  About 12 or 15" in diameter."


William Lassell observed NGC 2440 in Jan 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector on Malta.  He commented, "no description can do justice to this singular object.  With 150 it just attracts the eye in sweeping, as a a bluish-white spot, a few seconds in diameter.  A most extraordinary object [at 650x], not beautiful, for it has no symmetry – but wonderful."  His sketch, showing 4 or 5 knots, was included in his 1854 MRAS paper (figure 7).  Father Angelo Secchi published a detailed sketch and description in 1856 using the 9.6" refractor in Rome.  He noted, "It seems to consist of two twin nebulae joined to a third transverse elliptical nebula…but it is very difficult to recognize the true structure."


Ralph Copeland made a careful observation at Birr Castle on 20 Jan 1874: "vB, pL, very blue.  An eB nucleus which is E or bi-central in pos 151.4° in vF outer nebulosity, vmE 33.1° and 2' or 3' long.  35 stars in field (diam 11'), the nearest of which is *16m pos 200.8°, dist 54.8"..."  A sketch was prepared by Joseph Turner (unpublished plate V, figure 43) with the 48" Melbourne Telescope and Pietro Baracchi made a careful observation on 17 Mar 1885.


Based on Crossley photographs, Heber Curtis (1918) reported NGC 2440 has "no central star; the strong central masses are nebulous in the shortest exposures.  A very irregular and patchy oval; main portion 54"x20" in pa 37°, with a faint extension at east, north of the middle."

25" (4/1/19 and 4/2/19 - OzSky): at 244x; the prominent northern spiral arm appeared slightly brighter at the crook of the arm where it bends dramatically to the west.  This knot is catalogued in NED as [SD93] 38 and 39, from a 1993 paper by Sérsic and Donzelli, "The southern barred spiral NGC 2442".  A faint star is situated right at the eastern edge of this glow. The southwest end of the galaxy appeared patchy with a couple of subtly brighter knots, probably [SD93] 16 and 18.  Overally, NGC 2442 is quite an impressive and unusual galaxy!


24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I was amazed how prominent the sweeping spiral arms appeared at 260x giving a stunning "S" appearance.  The main bar of the galaxy is fairly bright and extended ~2:1 in a SW to NE orientation with a length of ~3'.  The bar has just a weak, broad concentration with no real core but it rises sharply at the center to a very small, brighter nucleus.  The main arm is attached at the northeast end of the bar and extends a short distance in that direction before dramatically bending sharply to the west (turning nearly 150°) and extending ~3.5' in length towards a mag 12.9 star.  At the NW end this well-defined arm fades and broadens a little, terminating just SE of the 13th magnitude star.  At the SW end of the bar, a thick arm emerges extending to the SW where it more gently curves around towards the east while fanning out.  This arm is not as sharply defined as the inside (east) portion of the curve blends with a diffuse glow extending from the bar.  The total distance between the tips of the arms spans nearly 5'.  In the same field 10' ENE lies ESO 059-011 and NGC 2534 is 16' NNW.  The field also includes a number of mag 9 to 11 stars that frame the galaxy.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 127x (20mm Nagler), the main body of this unusual galaxy appeared as a fairly faint, large, thick "bar" with just a weak concentration except for an extremely small bright core. On the NE end of the bar, a faint "arm" emerged at a sharp angle towards the NW.  The contrast was improved at 212x and the brighter arm was easier to view, extending at nearly a right angle to the main body and curving towards the west on the north side.  On the SW end a broad but short low surface brightness extension was visible bending towards the SE.  The main bar was elongated 2:1 SW-NE, roughly 3'x1.5', but the thick outer arm significantly increased the size to ~4.5'x2'.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2442 = h3097 on 23 Dec 1834 and recorded "A double nebula; very large; very faint; position of centres = 40°; diameter 4' and 3' running together, and having a star 13th magnitude at their junction." In his 2nd (of 4 sweeps) he called it "faint, very large, much elongated, very suddenly a little brighter to the middle, to a star 13th mag, like a very faint atmosphere, about a nucleus 3.5' long, 1.5' broad; pos of its extension = 39.8. I think it has some sort of hooked appendage."  The "hooked appendage" (NGC 2443) is the prominent arm on the north side (attached at the northeast end of the bar)!

48" (4/5/13): this remarkable ring galaxy forms an interacting pair with NGC 2444, just 1' N.  At 488x, it was resolved into six components -- the bright ring nucleus and five very small HII regions which are roughly equally spaced around the nucleus (separations between 25" and 42").  The four closest (VV 117b, 117e, 117f, 117g) form a very small square with the nucleus at the center!  The nucleus appears moderately bright to fairly bright, small, round, high surface brightness, 15" diameter.  The five HII regions are within an irregular, triangular glow, ~1.5' diameter.


VV 117b is at the northern end of NGC 2445, just 27" N of the nucleus and 36" SSE of NGC 2444.  It appeared very faint, very small, round, 8" diameter.  VV 117f is situated 25" W of the nucleus and appeared very faint to faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  VV 117h is at the SW corner (42" SW of the nucleus) and was the faintest of the 5 knots surrounding the nucleus.  It appeared extremely faint and small, round, just 5" diameter.  VV 117e is at the east end (35" E of the nucleus) and appeared very faint to faint, very small, irregularly round, ~12" diameter.


Finally, VV 117g is at the southeast corner, 30" S of the nucleus, and appeared fairly faint, very small, round, high surface brightness, 12" diameter. This object was the brightest of 5 "knots" surrounding the nucleus, although on the SDSS it appears to be an HII region attached to a foreground star, which certainly contributed to its brightness.  In the 2009 Madore "Atlas and Catalogue of Collisional Ring Galaxies" VV 117g is identified as the second collider (C2).

18" (3/2/08): very easy with any optical aid (at the threshold of naked-eye visibility) with a few of the brighter stars resolved in 15x50 IS binoculars.  The cluster is fairly well resolved at 25x in the 80mm finder.  The central region is superb in the 18" at 175x (13mm Ethos) with ~100 stars resolved in the 10' region and richest in the core.  Appears fully resolved into mag 10-14 stars.  A small, near parallelogram of 4 stars (sides ~40"x20") stands out near the center with numerous fainter stars nearby.  The brightest star on the SW side of the cluster is a nice, unequal double (ARA 2066 = 8.3/11.3 at 10").


13.1" (3/24/84): about 60 stars, bright, large, pretty rich.  Contains a tight quadrilateral near the center with three faint companions.

Charles Messier discovered M93 = NGC 2447 = h3098 on 20 Mar 1781.  Caroline Herschel independently discovered the cluster on 26 Feb 1783 and recorded "Nebula, about 1 1/4 deg north preceding the bright star in the Ship [or more exactly] preceding the 1st Navis [Puppis] towards 23 Canis Majoris. My Brother examined it with [magnification] 460 and found not less than 20 stars, with 227 above 40. with a compound eyepiece perhaps 100 and 150 very beautiful, nothing nebulous among them. Messier has it not."  Owen Gingerich determined that the reference to 1 (Rho) Navis, should read 7 (Zeta) Navis.  Observing from the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel noted "A fine cluster, scarcely scattered, pretty rich, not much more comp[ressed]. M [toward the middle]. Nearly fills field. Stars 8....13 m."

John Herschel discovered NGC 2452 = h3100 on 1 Feb 1837 and described as "An object whose nature I cannot make out. It is certainly not a star, nor a close double star; but it is not round, and I should call it an oblong planetary nebula, by reason of its decidedly marked though somewhat dim outline, were there not some suspicion of its being double, as if a very close and highly condensed double nebula. It is very small and rather faint, 8" long, 5" broad, and equals a star of 10th mag. In a field with at least 60 or 80 stars [NGC 2453], all sharp and well defined but this.  Four nights later he recorded "Planetary nebula. In a field with, and south of a cluster, and on a rich ground is the undefined object of Sweep 769. It is no doubt a very faint, small, round planetary nebula..."


A lithograph was prepared based on a sketch by Joseph Turner using the Great Melbourne Telescope (plate V, figure 44) but his drawing was never published.


Based on a Crossley photograph at Lick Observatory, Curtis (1918) reported "there is probably a faint central star, not brighter than mag 19.  Extreme length about 22" in pa 85° the centers of the bright lateral lobes are 11" apart.  In this exposure time the object has much the appearance of a reversed letter Z."  Based on radial velocity, NGC 2452 is in the foreground of open cluster NGC 2453.

This was the only observation made at Birr Castle and no positions were measured or even a rough sketch produced.  John Herschel added 8 additional entries in the GC, as h469 (later NGC 2463) and H III-836 = h470 (later NGC 2469) were previously discovered, but was unable to provide specific coordinates for these 8 objects.  Harold Corwin notes that Stoney likely observed only the 6 brightest galaxies in this region, so 4 of his objects are probably single stars or asterisms.

17.5" (2/22/03): this very small group of 5 faint mag 14-15 stars within 30" was just resolved at 220x .  At low power it appeared like a nebulous spot.  Although this may be a multiple star, it's likely just a compact asterism.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2459 = H III-479 = h468 on 26 Dec 1785 (sweep 494) and noted "suspected. eF, vS, lE, but may be a deception."  John Herschel observed it on 18 Jan 1828 (sweep 120) as "a large group of small stars which has a nebulous look, and perhaps there may be neb among them.  No other near."  On a later sweep he wrote "a small group of stars; with attention counted 5 with power 320; form a neb group 20" diameter.


This asterism was observed 6 times at Birr Castle and last noted by Dreyer as a "vs Cl of 5 st, no neby seen."  Dreyer also added a note in the IC 1 that "No nebulosity, only a couple of faint stars seen by Spitaler."

The main section is roughly mushroom shaped, extending generally south of the bright star.  The southern border is locally brighter along a strip oriented NW to SE.  There is a sharp light cut-off (apparently due to dust) passing to the north of the central star and oriented E-W.  Faint haze extends ~15' to the east.  To the north, fainter nebulosity extends 12' E-W, and brightens towards the east end at an elongated group of brighter stars (Haffner 18), oriented NW-SE.  Removing the filter, NGC 2467 resides in a gorgeous low power Milky Way field with numerous faint stars peppering the region.


17.5" (3/2/02): Using a 31 Nagler at 64x and an OIII filter, this is a prominent 7' nebulosity surrounding a mag 8 star.  A dark lane appears to cut through the nebula from west to east starting NW of the central star.  Fainter nebulosity extends beyond the dark lane but then fades out to the north.  The south and southeast border of the main mass has a bright, distinct edge and the southern border has a small extension on the west edge which hooks towards the NW.


A finger of nebulosity extends north from the main body and involves a scattered group of brighter stars. This strip dims but nearly merges with a much larger, elongated mass of fairly faint nebulosity extending NW to SE at a roughly right angle.  This section is ~15' in size with an irregular border that is bounded on the NE side by a string of brighter stars (Haffner 18).  This is a fascinating HII complex to explore in a rich star field!


17.5" (1/23/88): at 82x with OIII filter appears as a large, bright, circular nebulosity about 10' diameter.  A mag 7.8 star is involved north of center and several fainter stars are involved.  The nebulosity is brightest along the south side in a strip oriented NW-SE.  A group of brighter stars is NE (Haffner 18).  A separate larger (~15') but fainter section is 10'-15' NE and appears elongated.


8" (3/24/84): fairly bright, moderately large, roughly circular.  A mag 8 star is north of center.  This is a prominent nebulosity even with this aperture.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2467 = H IV-22 = h472 on 9 Dec 1784 (sweep 333) and recorded (two observations combined) "L, pB, almost R, easily resolvable, 6 to 10' diameter, a faint red colour visible. A star 8 mag not far from the center, but they evidently have no connection together.  By second observation, 9 or 10' diameter."  John Herschel observed it on 7 Jan 1831 (sweep 317) and wrote, "a * 9th mag with a W of stars and nebulosity, or ? is not a vF neb about the stars - no red colour seen."


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 2467 on 13 Jan 1877 with the Great Melbourne Telescope (p. 129 on his logbook, unpublished Plate V, figure 45) as an oval shaped nebula to the south of the bright star and brightest along the western side. See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 2471 = Big. 34 on 20 Feb 1851.  The number was assigned to one of a "Great many knots, reckoned 10 nearly in a line p f."  This was the only observation made at Birr Castle and no positions were measured or even a rough sketch produced.


In the NGC, Dreyer followed Bigourdan's observation on 9 Mar 1886 in assigning a position and description ("*13 slightly nebulous?").  There is nothing at Bigourdan's published position but Harold Corwin identifies NGC 2464 with a faint double star (~16" separation) about 2.5' NW of the NGC position.  Perhaps this is based on a later observation by Bigourdan.  RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 2472 on 20 Feb 1851.  The number was assigned to one of a "Great many knots, reckoned 10 nearly in a line p f."  This was the only observation made at Birr Castle and no positions were measured or even a rough sketch produced but there are 6 galaxies here in shallow arc oriented east-west.


In the NGC, Dreyer followed Bigourdan's positions and descriptions for six of these 8 entries, but Bigourdan didn't record an observation for NGC 2472 or 2473, so their coordinates are approximate in the NGC. As a result any assignment is somewhat arbitrary and this number could be considered lost.


The CGCG and RNGC identify CGCG 287-019 as NGC 2472 = NGC 2473.  NED and LEDA identify CGCG 287-019 as NGC 2472.  MCG does not label this galaxy with a NGC number.  Although it is uncertain if CGCG287-019 is one of Stoney's "knots", it is comparable to a couple of other very faint ones in the string.  See Harold Corwin's notes for NGC 2469.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2474 = H III-830 = h471 on 17 Mar 1790 (sweep 945) and called it "cF, pS, bM."

25" (4/6/19 - OzSky): at 244x; this amazing cluster filled the 25' field from edge to edge!  The central 7' was extremely dense and still very rich all the way out.  There are a couple of dozen 11th mag stars and over 500 stars from mag 12-15.5.  It really looked superb - like an extremely large, loose concentration class, highly resolved globular cluster.


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): remarkably rich carpet of mag 11-13 stars at 105x with perhaps 250-300 stars resolved in a 25' field.  The appearance is very similar to a highly resolved globular without a sharply concentrated core.  There are no distinct boundaries as stars loop outside the main group and many stars are arranged in long streamers.  Located roughly 20' N of a mag 4.5 star (HD 64503 = b Puppis).


13.1" (12/22/84): superb cluster, over 200 stars resolved in a 25' diameter, very rich in mag 11-14 stars.  Appears similar to NGC 7789 or a rich resolved globular cluster.  Located just north of b Puppis (V = 4.5).  This is one of the top open clusters in the sky despite the very low elevation!


8" (3/28/81): beautiful, large cluster, very rich in faint stars mag 11-13 over unresolved haze.  A mag 4 star is at the south edge.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 2477 = Lac I-3 = D 535 = h3103  in 1751-1752 using a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded a "large nebula 15' to 20' diameter." James Dunlop described this cluster as "a pretty large faint nebula, easily resolvable into small stars, or rather a cluster of very small stars, with a small faint nebula near the north preceding side, which is rather difficult to resolve into exceedingly small stars. This is probably two clusters or nebula in the same line; the small nebula is probably three times the distance of the large nebula."  Dunlop's position for D 535 is ~12' NW of center of the cluster.


John Herschel lists 3 observations in his Cape catalogue: on 1 Feb 1835 he recorded "Cluster 6th class, bright, large, rich, not very highly condensed in the middle. Stars very remarkably equal. All 12 or 13th mag. Very few 14th mag; none 11th mag. A fine object."  On a second sweep he described it as "a very beautiful large cluster, very rich; stars nearly equal, and 12th mag, gbm, not much compressed in the middle; more than fills the field. (N.B. It is visible in the finder of the equatorial, and in the telescope of that instrument appears as a fine cluster."  Finally on his last sweep he described it as a "Superb cluster, gbM, 20' diameter, much more than fills the whole field. Stars 10 and 11th mag all nearly equal."

See observing notes for M47 = NGC 2422.


Charles Messier discovered M47 = NGC 2478 on 19 Feb 1771 and recorded a "Cluster of stars a short distance from the preceding [M46]; the stars are brighter; the middle of the cluster was compared with the same star, 2 Navis.  The cluster contains no nebulosity."  There is nothing at his position, but it was assigned GC 1594 and NGC 2478 as placeholders for the missing cluster.  Giovanni Hodierna probably made the first observation of M47 before 1654 and simply recorded "a Nebulosa between the two dogs".


In the October 1960 issue of Sky & Tel, Owen Gingrich claims in "The Missing Messier Objects" that Messier apparently switched the signs of his offsets from his comparison star, 2 Navis (now 2 Puppis), and cites articles or notes by Oswald Thomas in 1934 and T. F. Morris in 1959.  Harold Corwin doesn't fully accept this explanation (see his identification notes) as reversing the offset sign doesn't yield a very good match positional match.  In any case, the cluster now taken as M47 was independently discovered by Caroline Herschel on 26 Feb 1783 and observed by William Herschel on 4 Feb 1785.  Herschel catalogued it as H. VIII-38 (later NGC 2422), so it is assumed M47 = NGC 2478 = NGC 2422.  See Corwin's notes for the full story.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2489 = H VII-23 = h479 = h3107 on 30 Dec 1785 (sweep 501) and reported "a compressed cluster of pretty large stars, considerably rich."  This cluster was probably first discovered by James Dunlop on 28 May 1826 and logged as "a cluster of small stars, of an irregular round figure, with faint nebula, easily resolvable. The 257 Argus is south following."  His position for D 626 is 30' WNW of center, but despite the poor position the description is reasonable.


JH observed the cluster from the Cape of Good Hope on 22 Jan 1835 and recorded "A round, pretty compressed cluster of stars 11..13th mag; 6th or 7th class; gradually brighter in the middle, pretty rich, 7' diameter."  On a second sweep he wrote "Cluster 7th class. Round, 5' diameter, stars 12th mag."

The brightest two stars are at the west side and form a wide, 27" double.  The richest portion roughly forms a "U" outline, open to the south, as if a chunk of the cluster was missing.  The north side of the "U" consists of a string of stars oriented WNW-ESE (north of the two brightest stars) with a pair at the WNW end.  At the ESE end of this string a few brighter stars form a right angle heading SSW and forming another side of the "U".  A faint string of stars extends out of the cluster to the SE and another string extends out the WNW.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2508 = H III-7 = h484 on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 100) and recorded "a nebulous star, but doubtful of the nebulosity.  Yet with 240 the same doubtful appearance continues."  There is nothing near his position, but 1 min 42 sec of RA west and 3' south is UGC 4174.  This was still an early sweep in which his positions were unreliable.  On 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 496) he mentions "I looked for the supposed nebulous star of the 100th sweep, but the evening being remarkably clear and my telescope in fine order I only saw near the place several very close double stars, one of which probably has been the suspected one.  Otherwise a small telescopic comet may have been thereabout."  JH observed this galaxy on two sweeps although on sweep 120 no position was measured and on sweep 123 the position was marked very uncertain.  The accurate NGC position is from Heinrich d'Arrest.

18" (3/2/08): beautiful cluster of 80-100 stars at 175x, highlighted by a dense 2-2.5' clump of fainter stars resolved over some remaining haze.  Double or multiple stars are at the NE and NW corners of this central knot.  At 220x the SE corner of the clump is very rich in faint stars with averted!  The brightest star is at the SW side with a string of mag 10-11 stars extending outside of the cluster to the SE from of this star.  The cluster is situated ~6' NW of mag 8.8 HD 66034.


17.5" (3/12/94): 50 stars resolved in a 6'x5' region outlined by a perfect parallelogram.  The majority of the stars, though, lie in a prominent dense clump along the NW side of the parallelogram and includes a nice double star.  The NE vertex of the parallelogram is a double star with components mag 13/13.5 at 12".  The parallelogram has no concentration and the interior southern portion has only a couple of faint stars.  Mag 8.6 SAO 153720 lies roughly 6' SE and a bright wide double star consisting of a mag 10.5/12 pair at 26" is 4' NNE of the parallelogram.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2509 = H VIII-1 on 3 Dec 1783 (very early sweep, internal discovery #7) and recorded "a cl of coarsely scattered stars.  The place is that of the most comp part, which is not M[iddle]"  On 4 Mar 1790 (sweep 934) and logged "a considerably compressed and very rich cl of small star, irr F." and on 15 Mar 1801 (sweep 1095) he noted "a beautiful cl of stars, arranced in a circular order."

13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica): very bright naked-eye cluster located 3° SW of Epsilon Car (southern star in the False Cross).  Appears partially resolved in the 9x50 finder and an excellent view using the 15x50 IS binoculars.  The cluster fills over half of the 20mm Nagler field, ~30'-35' diameter with over 100 stars resolved.  The outline is quite irregular though well-detached at low power.  A mag 5.2 M-type giant orange star (V460 = HD 66342) lies at the NE edge of the cluster.  The central region is more concentrated and uniform and includes a number of tinted yellow or orange stars.  A nice triple star (h4027 = 7.1/7.8/9.3 at 9" and 20") is on the west edge of the cluster and an excellent double (h4031 = 7.2/8.0 at 5") lies on the east side of the cluster.  A long curving string starts in the center and heads NE to the mag 5.2 orange star.  This string includes a 9" evenly matched pair of mag 9 stars (Innes 1104) that was resolved at low power.  Mag 5.7 K-type orange subgiant HD 65662 is off the NW side of the cluster.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this bright naked-eye cluster is located SW of the "False Cross" (3 degrees SW of 2nd-magnitude Epsilon Carinae) and is the only open cluster in western Carina.  It was well resolved in the 9x50 finder.  At 105x, the main group is 25'-30' with outliers increasing the size and roughly 100 stars are resolved including a number of mag 6-8 stars.  Many of the stars are arranged in loops and strings and overall the cluster is quite irregular in magnitudes and star distributions.  There is a close, fairly bright double on the SE side (7.2/8.0 at 5.5") and a neat 13' chain of stars near the west side running N-S.


10x30 Canon IS (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a prominent naked-eye cluster below the "False Cross" (formed by Epsilon and Iota Car as well as Delta and Kappa Vel), on a line with the longer axis (Epsilon Car and Kappa Vel) of the cross.  In binoculars, it appeared well-resolved, ~50' diameter including outliers with 5 bright stars (mag 6.5-7.5) with a couple of dozen stars resolved overall.  Appears fairly rich towards the center with a number of mag 8-10 stars.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): very bright naked-eye cluster, gorgeous even at 10x with a couple of dozen stars resolved, 40'-50' diameter, many brighter stars around the periphery, but richer towards the center.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 2516 = Lac II-3 = h3111 in 1751-1752 using a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted a "Group of 10 to 12 stars, very compressed."  NGC 2516 was not published in Dunlop's main catalogue but his handwritted notes read "Very fine cluster about 35' diameter, many of the stars of the 6th and 7th magnitude, mixed magnitudes.  Figure irregular branched."


JH observed the cluster a number of times with his 18-inch f/13 speculum telescope at the CGH. His first record reads: "An orange-coloured star 8th magnitude, in middle of a large and magnificent cluster of perhaps 200 to 250 stars 8..16th mag. Many of the larger magnitudes, and really a superb object. Very visible to the naked eye, etc."

There is only a single galaxy at his position (UGC 4221) identified as NGC 2518.  Corwin notes that 39 tsec following this galaxy is a 14th magnitude star (with three much fainter stars within an arcmin northwest) which might be the NGC 2519.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2520 = h3112 on 5 Feb 1837 and recorded a "Cluster 7th class, distinguished among milky way clusters, pretty rich, bright. The star taken is the chief of a condensed hook in the following part."  In the Cape Observations, JH identifies h3112 as equivalent to H VIII-30 = h488 but his position for h3112 is 3.0 min of RA too far west.  Although his description matches H VIII-30 = h488, JH still listed separate entries in the GC for h3112  and h488, which later received the designations NGC 2520 and NGC 2527.  So, NGC 2520 = NGC 2527, with NGC 2527 the earlier observation.

Corwin sorted out the situation (see his notes for NGC 2528), although it was first corrected by Esmiol in his 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions.  Esmiol's new position (calling the object "Anon"), establishes NGC 2528 = UGC 4227.  UGC 4227 is not labeled with the NGC designation in CGCG (207-032), UGC (4227) or MCG (+07-17-015) but it is correctly identified in RNGC, PGC and RC3.

Contains a relatively large, bright core spanning ~40"x30" and punctuated by a very bright, stellar nucleus.  Attached at the west side of the core is a graceful spiral arm that curves clockwise towards the south-southeast in the direction of NGC 2536.  The arm faded towards the south-southeast end though increased in length with averted vision.  Still, it didn't reach the smaller companion.  A second arm is attached on the east side and shoots north, though it's only 2/3 the length of the southern arm.  A string (1.4' length) of three mag 12-13 stars is off the west side of the galaxy.

48" (4/15/10): At 624x, the view of the highly irregular "Bear-paw" galaxy (Arp 6) was fascinating.  The galaxy is fairly large, roundish, 1.5' diameter and is broken up into bright knots and arcs that border a large curving dust lane that winds through the glow and traces out a dark "U" inside the galaxy.  The main bright regions form the three "toes" of the Bear-paw.  On the NW side, the first "toe" consists of the brightest knot, ~0.3' diameter, with a second smaller and fainter knot close south.  The combined glow for this "toe" is ~30" diameter.  In the center is a brighter core, ~0.3' diameter, which is nearly isolated by the obscuring dust, but the glow extends to the south end of the galaxy where it brightens slightly at the rim, forming the middle toe.  The third toe is on the following side of the galaxy (~0.3' diameter) and is less prominent, though slightly brighter due east of center.  The curving "U"-shaped dust channel enters the galaxy both west and east of the middle toe in two parallel lanes and curves around the core, forming a noticeable arc on the north side of the core.


NGC 2537A, situated 4.5' E, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, weak central brightening.  A mag 13.5 star lies 1.2' S and a mag 15.4 star is 57" WSW.


17.5" (3/23/85): moderately bright, fairly small, round.  The "Bear-paw" galaxy has an unusual appearance with a dark lane or vacuity in the center.  A small slightly brighter knot is visible along the NW edge.  A mag 11 star is 2' SE.  Located 6.5' E of mag 8.4 SAO 42225.  IC 2233, a faint edge-on, lies 18' SE.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2537 = H IV-55 = h491 on 6 Feb 1788 (sweep 809) and recorded "pB; R; pL; preceding a star about 1'."  On 10 Mar 1788 (sweep 817) he logged "pB, R, almost of an even light througout, approaching to a planetary [he placed it in the category of planetary nebulae] but very ill defined, and a little fainter on the edges, about 3/4 or 1' dia." John Herschel observed the galaxy on 19 Mar 1828 (sweep 139) and remarked, "It is a globular cluster.  Being a remarkable fine night, I see the stars."  NGC 2537 was observed 20 times at Birr Castle and even noted as "probably spiral" in Jan 1852, although photographs show no significant spirality.  Other observations refer to its resolvability and the GC and NGC description call it a globular cluster!  When it was photographed at Lick Observatory with the Crossley reflector, Curtis noted (1918), "This is not a cluster, as described in the NGC, but a bright, irregular spiral."  Francis Peases desribed it as a "horseshoe" based on a photograph with the 60" at Mt. Wilson, and mentions a "faint spot" nearby to the east, which is the companion galaxy NGC 2537A.


Wolfgang Steinicke reports that the nickname is from Ron Buta, based on an observation through a 36" telescope at McDonald 36" (Webb Society Galaxy Handbook, 1981): "Small and of relatively high surface brightness; shaped like a bear-paw, the structure consisting of a single spiral arm winding from W to E around the N side; this ring-tail includes 3 knots, one of about 15 mag; a bar-like feature shows in the interior region of the arm and extends to the S edge of the galaxy; there is a faint glow between the arm and the bar feature".

John Herschel discovered NGC 2542 = h3115 on 11 Dec 1836 and noted "a fine nebulous star 6 mag [19 Pup], in the following part of the cluster VII II [NGC 2539] and almost connected to it.  The nebula is faint, but I feel confident that it is not the nebulous haze. [Notandum -Nothing more difficult than to prove a nebulous star of the 6th mag and above."  In this case, the star is free of nebulosity.  This is the 3rd brightest star with an entry in the NGC (after NGC 771 and 4530).


There are several similar cases of bright stars which Herschel assumed had a nebulous halo (see notes on NGC 4530).  Harold Corwin mentions that he may have been misled by the faint companion of 19 Puppis, though I think it's more likely he was misled by scattered light/dew.  Interestingly, three observations were made with the 72" and all described the star as being nebulous!  Pietro Baracchi, observing with the 48" Melbourne telescope on 9 Jan 1886, wrote in his logbook that it was necessary to hide the star to see the nebulosity and if he had not known of the description he would not had noticed anything.   In addition, Howe reported "I examined it one night, and saw a faint halo about 2' in diameter encircling it.  It looked like a telescopic flare."

While scanning for NGC 2547 I ran across a bright, distinctive red star to the west (probably M3-class HD 67821).


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this is a very bright naked-eye cluster that includes a number of mag 7-8 stars.  It appears at least 20'-25' in diameter, though the outer boundaries are pretty arbitrary.  Very unusual arrangement as a number of the brighter stars form a curving arc which is bowed out towards the east and which defines the eastern border of the cluster!  The brightest mag 6.5 star is within this arc on the south side of the cluster.  The cluster is encased in faint reflection nebulosity, though this was not visible.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 2547 = Lac III-2 = D 410 = h3117 in 1751-1752 using a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He described III-2 as "five faint stars like the letter T in nebulosity."  Dunlop observed the cluster twice recording "A curiously arranged group of pretty bright small stars of mixt magnitudes. This answers to the place of 310 Argus (Bode) and is described by Lacaille as nebula with five small stars forming the letter T in it. There is no nebulosity in this place. The diameter of the cluster may be about 12'. Figure 16 [in his publication] is a very good representation of the group."


John Herschel first logged the cluster on 28 Dec 1834 and recorded "chief star 7th mag about, of a vL, loose, brilliant cluster of very scattered stars, 1 of 7th mag, 2 of 8th mag, rest 9...16th mag.  Fills more than field; 100...150 stars."  JH inadvertently equated this cluster with D 411 instead of D 410 and this error was copied into the NGC.

V = 5.8;  Size 54'


18" (3/15/10): large, sprawling cluster that nearly fills the 67' field of the 31mm Nagler.  The most distinctive portion, though, is a 20'x15' group near the center which contains roughly 75 stars, many arranged in strings.  Most prominent is a fairly dense SW-NE string of brighter stars that cuts through the cluster with a nice double star in the center (h 2435 = 9.6/9.7 at 7"). A short chain of a few stars branches off to the south of h2435. Another stream of stars branches off this string  to the SSW.  A third elongated group of stars extends SW-NE on the south side, roughly parallel to main string, and is separated by a mostly starless lane.  The cluster includes a number of mag 8-9 stars, with the brightest mag 8.2.  At 73x, the main cluster is wedged between two very long streams of stars, roughly oriented NW to SE off both the north and south sides of the main group.  These two strings of stars extend the total diameter to over 50'.  On the NW side of the central group, a number of stars are scattered between these two streams including a few very wide pairs, but the SE end the two streams are well separated with a very few stars in between.


13.1" (2/16/85): about 125 stars in a large 40' field with no distinct borders.  A rich chain of stars oriented SSW-NNE passes through the center.  Includes a number of brighter mag 10 stars and many double stars.  Partially resolved in 16x80 finder.


Charles Messier discovered M48 = NGC 2548 = H VI-22 = h496 on 19 Feb 1771 and described a "Cluster of very faint stars, without nebulosity; this cluster is a short distance from the three stars that form the beginning of the Unicorn's tail."  Johann Bode independently found it the cluster again before 1782.  But the identification of M48 was lost due to an error in Messier's listed position.  In a 1934 book, Oswald Thomas identified M48 with NGC 2548 (without explanation) and in 1959 T.F. Morris pointed out that NGC 2548 has the same RA as Messier's position for M48 though differed by 5° in declination. Owen Gingerich publicized Morris' identification in his 1960 article "The Missing Messier Objects" in Sky & Tel.


Caroline Herschel independently discovered M48 on 8 Mar 1783 and William found it on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 519).  He recorded VI-22 (later NGC 2548) as "a beautiful cluster of stars, considerably rich, and pretty much compressed, 10 or 12' dia.  The stars are nearly of a size, white and pretty large."  He later noted "C.H. [Caroline Herschel] discovered it in 1783."

17.5" (3/7/92): faint, fairly large, elongated 3:2 E-W, ~2.0'x1.5', very low even surface brightness.  There is no core and the outer halo is not well defined.  Several stars are superimposed including a mag 13.5 star 22" ESE of center.  Situated in a rich Milky Way field.  Brightest in a group including IC 2311 7.6' N.  Located just 6° from the galactic equator.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2566 = H III-288 on 6 Mar 1785 (sweep 381) and recorded "vF, considerably large, easily resolvable or rather some of the stars visible besides those of the milky way scattered over it."  His position is off the north side of the galaxy.  Herbert Howe described the galaxy as a "vS neb or neb *11 w/*12 close".  Pietro Baracchi described this object as "vF; pL; 2 stars 14m involved.  A multititude of stars in the field." (9 Jan 1886, 48" Melbourne).  Visually, nearby IC 2311 has a higher surface brightness and is more identifiable as a galaxy!

E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 2568 in 1881 with his 5-inch refractor in Nashville while sweeping for comets.  In Sidereal Messenger, Vol 3, p60, he described a "very faint nebulosity of moderate extension; pretty even in light. A small star involved."  In The Observatory, 8, p123, he wrote "Faint, close to, and south preceding a small star; the star is partly involved in the nebula."  The latter observation was probably made with the 6-inch Cook refractor.  So, with the 5- and 6-inch scope he didn't resolve the cluster.  His discovery list in AN 2588 (1884) mentions Oliver Wendell, using the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory, described it as "rather diffuse and faint, but gradually a little brighter in the middle."  I'm surprised the large refractor didn't provide some resolution.  Paris Pismis reported the cluster as new (= Pismis 1) in her 1959 list of clusters found on Schmidt plates at the Tonantzintla Observatory.


Cederblad catalogued the cluster Ced 105, although there does not appear to be nebulosity involved.  The Lynga open cluster catalogue and Sky Catalogue 2000.0 identify the cluster as Pismis 1 although Barnard's accurate position makes the NGC identification certain.  ESO does label the cluster NGC 2568.

24" (3/21/20): at 200x; very interesting cluster with ~30 stars in the core of the cluster, including two 9th mag stars, HD 70058 and 70078, oriented NW-SE and a large number of stars 10th-11th magnitude. The "core" stars are pretty isolated by a wide, mostly empty ring with only much fainter stars. At a radius of 4' from the center is a prominent string of stars to the NW (oriented SW-NE) and an extensive group of stars to the south that may also be part of the cluster. Including the large group out to 13' diameter increases the total to 100-120 stars (though a large number are unrelated stars), but it appears too loose to be distinctive at this size.  This region of the Milky Way is rich in bright and faint stars: a 7th mag star (HD 69817) is 17' WNW and mag 6-7th mag stars are 20' SW and 20' NE.


13.1"  (3/24/84): 18 stars mag 8.8-12 in 10' diameter.  Includes a wide bright pair (mag 8.8 SAO 175580 and 8.9 SAO 175577) at 1' separation oriented NW-SE near the center.  This cluster is larger and contains brighter stars than NGC 2587 one degree ENE.  Also NGC 2580 lies 47' SE and NGC 2567 54' S.

30" (10/15/15 - OzSky): at 303x "Polarissima Australis" appeared moderately bright and large, very elongated at least 3:1, ~1.5'x0.5'.  Contains a small bright core and a sharp stellar nucleus (possibly a star?).  Mag 10.3 HD 23641 is 7.4' WNW.


NGC 2573 is the brightest of three galaxies close to the south celestial pole with NGC 2573A and 2573B 32' WNW.  NGC 2573A is the fainter of a colliding pair at 1.3' separation.  At 303x it appeared very faint to faint, moderately large, very elongated 7:2 ~N-S, ~0.7'x0.2', low surface brightness.  NGC 2573B is fairly faint, very elongated 3:1 [PA 125°], 0.6'x0.2', fairly low surface brightness.  The major axis is extended in the direction of NGC 2573A.  A mag 13 star is 1.2' N.  Images reveal an apparent bridge between the galaxies and  plumes, tidal tails and knots (particularly with NGC 2573A).  The outer tidal plumes were not seen based on my size estimate.


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 2573 is known as "Polarissima Australis" and is located only 40' from the south celestial pole.  At 260x it appeared fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 7:2, ~1.6'x0.45'.  Contains a very small, bright nucleus with much fainter extensions. A mag 10.6/11.2 pair at 7" separation was picked up 13' NNE.  This galaxy was brighter than I expected based on descriptions I've read.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2573 = h3176 on 29 Mar 1837 and recorded "Neb Polarissima Australis. Faint, round, gradually a little brighter in the middle, 25" across. Situated nearly halfway between a star of 10th magnitude south of it, and a small triangle of stars 11th, 13th and 13th mag. north." This is the closest galaxy to the south celestial pole.  In 1919 Robert Innes reported he was unsuccessful in searching for it under the best condistions with the 9-inch Grubb refractor at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg. The RNGC positions are in error for NGC 2573, 2573A and 2573B.

17.5" (2/1/92): small, bright compact nebula involving a mag 10.5 star.  Visible without filter as a small bright knot forming a close double with the mag 10.5 star just west.  Using an OIII filter at 140x the size increases to 2' diameter and encompasses the mag 10.5 star.  With this combination the nebula is quite prominent as the surface brightness is quite high!  Located within a large scattered group of about 20 stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2579 = h3122 on 1 Feb 1835 and recorded "A double star (h4083) involved in pB nebulosity, which seems to belong to both stars; but of the two the smaller is more nebulous; diameter 50"; in a pretty rich patch of the milky way."  The next night he logged "a double star, or a star and a nebula, very close and involving the star ... the field contains about 70 stars, of which 8 are about 9th mag. I cannot be quite positive that the neb extends beyond the large star, or that the small one is not a mere condensation of it. However, I remain pretty well satisfied of its investing both."  His mean position (4 sweeps) corresponds with this compact HII region.


Joseph Turner described NGC 2579 as two pairs of double stars on 14 Feb 1882 with the 48" Melbourne telescope.  Both pairs are oriented ~N-S on his sketch with the brightest star at the west end.


The Lynga catalogue includes NGC 2579 as an open cluster at 08 20.3 -36 15 (1950), placing the object 20' too far SE!  At the Lynga position is a scattered group of stars.  This error is repeated in amateur sky-plotting software such as MegaStar.  ESO 370-PN?009 is a faint, detached piece off the southeast side with a separate ionizing star.

Frank Muller discovered NGC 2585 = LM 2-404 in 1886 and recorded "mag 14.0, 0.5' dia, R, 3rd of 4 [with NGC 2583, 2584, 2586]."  There is nothing at his position, but 1.0 minute of RA west (same offset as NGC 2583 and 2584) is MCG -01-22-010 = PGC 23537.  Kobold measured an accurate micrometric position at Strasbourg in 1895 as well as Porter at the Cincinnati Observatory in 1906.  MCG misidentifies MCG -01-22-012 as NGC 2585.

24" (2/16/15): at 322x; this faint triple star (components all roughly mag V = 16) appeared as a very faint, very small glow, 0.3' diameter with a mag 16 star often resolving.  It was easy to see how this object could be assumed to be a nebula (galaxy).  At 450x, 2 or all 3 stars sparkled, but I couldn't hold them simultaneously.


The RNGC and PGC identifies MCG -01-22-012 as NGC 2585.  At 322x, this galaxy appeared faint to fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 21"x15", low surface even surface brightness.  Note: my description applies to the central region and I missed the very low surface brightness spiral arms.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 2586 = LM 2-405, along with NGCs 2583, 2584 and 2585, in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  He noted "mag 16.2, 0.8' dia, R, 4th of 4; neb?".


Near his published position is MCG -01-22-012, but Harold Corwin identifies NGC 2586 with a triple star at 08 23 31.4 -04 57 07 (2000).  This triple is 1.0 minute of time west of Muller's position, agreeing with his offsets for NGC 2583, 2584 and 2585.  RNGC and PGC are probably incorrect in identifying MCG -01-22-012 as NGC 2586, though this still seems a plausible identification as it is certainly bright enough to be picked up Muller.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2602 = h508 on 16 Feb 1831 (sweep 327).  His mean position from two observations is 08 35 01.4 +52 50 10 (2000), an excellent match with CGCG 263-056.  His description from the next night reads "eF; S; R; north-preceding a star (about 5° n p).  The preceding neb of 2 [with NGC 2606].  A mag 10.8 star 2.5' ENE is probably the intended star, so the description should read "south-preceding a star".   MCG and PGC correctly identify NGC 2602.


The field was observed three times at Birr Castle.  On the first observation (9 Feb 1850), the three brightest galaxies -- NGC 2600, 2602 and 2606 -- were likely observed.  On a second observation by R.J. Mitchell on 11 Mar 1858, 4 nebulae were described and sketched.  Harold Corwin suggests the following identifications: "4 neb. found, alpha [NGC 2603] is F, S, bM; beta [NGC 2605] is vvF, gamma [NGC 2602] F, S, lbM; delta [NGC 2606] is E and has a Nucl, a F * sf. alpha and gamma are about 5 arcmin dist. from one another, and beta and delta about the same dist. apart."


In compiling the GC, it appears that JH assumed alpha was h508 = NGC 2602, the preceding nebula in the sketch.  So, he misplaced the two LdR novae -- NGC 2603 and NGC 2605 -- following, instead of preceding NGC 2602.  In addition, on the third observation (5 Mar 1867), Sir Robert Ball noted "2 neb seen nearly p f, p one eeF, f one [NGC 2606]  eF.  Measures extremely difficult.  Pos 92°, Dist 118°."

R.J. Mitchell, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 2603 and 2605 on 11 Mar 1858.  Although he made a sketch of 4 galaxies (out of 6 total in the group), the identifications have been confused (seen notes for NGC 2602).  NGC 2602 (discovered by John Herschel) is labeled Gamma and NGC 2606 is labeled Delta.  Of the two remaining galaxies, the logical assignment is NGC 2603 = Alpha = LEDA 3133653 and NGC 2605 = Beta = LEDA 2424112. Alpha was noted as "F, S, bM."  JH assumed Alpha = NGC 2602 when compiling the GC, so he placed NGC 2603, as well as NGC 2605, following NGC 2602 instead of preceding.


RNGC misidentifies LEDA 2423840, the faintest galaxy in the group, as NGC 2603.  LEDA 2423840 was noted on Sir Robert Ball's observation on 5 March 1867 (preceding NGC 2606 by 118" in PA 90°), but it didn't receive a NGC designation as Dreyer was not sure which two nebulae were described in this observation.  The MCG entry for NGC 2603 (MCG +09-14-072) probably applies to much brighter NGC 2606 as there are no other nearby MCG entries.  At ~785 million light years (z = 0.057), this is certainly one of the most distant galaxies in the NGC.

The rim is slightly brighter in a 90° arc centered on the NW side and appears slightly irregular or ragged around the periphery. The rim was slightly weaker just south of a prominent 12th magnitude star on the NE edge.  The faint central star was easily visible.  With a NPB filter there was a thin outer halo.  Located 3.5' SW of a mag 6.6 HD 72665.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2610 = H IV-35 = h513 = 3127 on 31 Dec 1785 (sweep 503) and recorded "a small star with an electrical brush sp; F; S.  About 1 1/2' after follows a star of the 8th magnitude.  It resembles fig 7, Phil. Trans. Vol LXXIV.Tab.17. [Plate VII]".  Herschel commented in his 1814 PT paper that "a small star has a small, faint, fan-shaped nebulosity joining to it on the north preceding side."  He used this example to (incorrectly) demonstrate the union or mutual attraction between the objects.  On 16 Nov 1827 (sweep 111), John Herschel wrote, "A * 14m with a fan-shaped brush 15" l  to the sp side; the brush however judged by both Mr. [James?] Dunlop (who saw it) and myself not to be in contact."  The 1 Feb 1851 observation by Lord Rosse reads "Dark space foll star, bet neb and star stronlgly suspected like the "snow-drop nebula" [NGC 2261].  Lord Rosse suspected a star in it also."


In 1915, Harold Knox-Shaw reported this object was annular and the spectrum probably gaseous based on a photograph with the Reynolds reflector at the Helwan Observatory. The spectrum was confirmed by Campbell and Paddock at Lick.  Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "the ring is slightly irregular, hazy and without structural detail; is 38"x31" in pa 75°.  Relatively vacant around the central.  The matter in the ring is rather faint."

William Herschel discovered NGC 2628 = H III-235 on 16 Nov 1784 (sweep 318) and recorded "eF, S, verified with 240 power." His position is ~15 sec of RA west and 1' north  of UGC 4519, but the identification is certain as there are no other nearby candidates.  There were no further observations by JH or d'Arrest and it was not found with the 72" at Birr Castle on 28 Jan 1867 for some reason.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2629 = H III-982, along with NGC 2641, on 30 Sep 1802 on his last sweep 1112.  He recorded "Two [NGC 2629 & NGC 2641], the place is that of the last [NGC 2641].

It is within 1' of a small star which follows it, and which is free from the burs which affect the stellar."


This nebula was not included in WH's third catalogue as it was discovered after his 500 discovery threshold was reached on 26 Sept 1802.  It was added as one of the 8 "HON" objects ("William Herschel omitted nebulae") by JH in the Appendix to his Cape Observations and then included in the GC as III 982. Caroline Herschel's reduced position (for 1800) is 5' due south of UGC 4569, though the NGC position from d'Arrest is accurate.  This galaxy is misidentified as NGC 2630-31 in MCG (+12-09-010).

NGC 2630

08 47 06 +73 00; UMa


= Not found, Corwin.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2630 and 2631 in July 1883 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory near Florence.  In his discovery paper IX (AN #2660), Tempel refers to "two new fine nebula very close to NGC 2629" (after the main table) and mentions that "my two new nebulae are much brighter than those found by D’Arrest [NGC 2614] and William Herschel [NGC 2629/2641]."  Dreyer was only able to provide an approximate position near NGC 2629 when compiling the NGC, but no pair of bright nebulae exists near NGC 2629 that might be Tempel's objects.  Nevertheless, a confusing array of identifications have been made by various galaxy catalogues.


RNGC selects UGC 4547 as NGC 2630 and classifies NGC 2631 as nonexistent (Type 7).  UGC 4547 is a thin edge-on situated 7' WNW of NGC 2629 (see observation).  I feel this identification is unlikely due to its extreme faintness and Malcolm Thomson concurs.  UGC 4547 is not identified as NGC 2630 in the UGC or CGCG (331-061) and is misidentified as NGC 2629 in the MCG and as NGC 2630 = NGC 2631 in the PGC errata paper.  In addition, MCG misidentifies NGC 2629 = MCG +12-09-010 as NGC 2630 = NGC 2631.


I discussed the identifications in several letters with Harold Corwin. He suggests that Tempel may have confused NGC 2633 for NGC 2629 and that NGC 2630 and 2631 might be identical to NGC 2634 and NGC 2634A, about 9' SSE of NGC 2633.  But NGC 2634A is a very faint edge-on and I doubt Tempel would refer to this galaxy as a "fine nebula".  So, this pair of numbers is currently lost.  See Corwin's notes for further discussion.

16x80mm: extremely large, 1.5° diameter, very bright, brightest stars are mag 6-6.5, includes many double stars, well resolved.  The cluster is really too large and spread out for a decent view in either my 13" or larger scopes.


Naked-eye: fairly bright fuzzy glow in dark skies.  Granular with a few resolved stars in excellent conditions.


Aratos of Soli made the first written mention of M44 = Beehive cluster about 260 BC in his work Phainomeina (called a "little mist") and it was probably noted 100 years earlier by Eudoxis. It was later recorded by Hipparchus around 130 BC as a "little cloud". Galileo made the first known telescopic observation that clearly resolved M44 into a star cluster, though a few stars may be glimpsed naked eye under excellent conditions.  His observation of 1610 in Siderius Nuncius ("Starry Messenger") reads "The nebula called Praesepe, which is not one star only, but a mass of more than 40 small stars, I have noticed 36 stars besides the Aselli."


The earliest found reference to the nickname "Beehive" is from Admiral Smyth's Bedford Catalogue of 1844: "The Praesepe, metaphorically rendered Bee-hive, is an aggregation of small stars which has long borne the name of a nebula, its components not being separately distinguishable by the naked eye…"

48" (3/1/19): Excellent, fairly large, two-armed barred spiral!  The central part of the galaxy consists of a very prominent bar oriented ~3:1 NNW-SSE, with a very bright core.  A striking spiral arm is attached at the south end of the bar.  It bends sharply clockwise and extends north, on the east side of bar, arcing gently with a length of ~1.5'.  This arm has a well defined inner and outer edge and is separated from the bar by a dark gap.  As the arm extends north it fades but at the northern end bends sharply west [1.0' N of center] and noticeably brightens in an elongated piece [consisting of multiple HII regions on images].  At the north end of the bar a second arm emerges towards the west and starts to curl south, but fades and dims, reaching no further south than the center of the bar.

17.5" (2/8/97): extremely faint and small, round.  Appears as 10" nebulous star which required averted vision to glimpse at moments.  Appears fainter than 15.4z.  Located 7' ESE of mag 6.7 SAO 98030 within M44. The identification of NGC 2637 with CGCG 089-065 is not certain due to a poor position by Marth.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 2637 = m 130, along with NGC 2643, on 30 Oct 1864. He simply noted "eeF, vS."  There is nothing at his position except brighter stars, but 8' N and 6 sec of RA west is CGCG 089-065 = PGC 24409, which is identified as NGC 2637 in RNGC, but not CGCG.  Although Marth's declination is poor, this is a similar declination offset as nearby NGC 2643, probably discovered at the same time, so this identification is reasonably secure.  See Corwin's notes.


This galaxy was also reported as #154 in a catalog of new nebulae and clusters found on photographs taken by Keeler between 1898-1900 and published in the 1908 Publications of Lick Observatory, Vol VIII.

John Herschel, observing with Thomas Maclear (the Astronomer Royal at the Cape Observatory), discovered NGC 2640 = h3134 on 26 Feb 1835.  He recorded, "pF; S; R; has 3 or 4 vS stars near it, preceding.  Observation taken by Mr. Maclear." Herschel mentioned in his diary that he invited Maclear that night to repeat his "Great Sweep" (#551), which he made on three weeks earlier.  He called that experience "the subline of Astronome - a sort of 'ne plus ultra'."  Fortunately, the night of the 25th "turned out glorious! Clear as crystal and pure as aether. A finer night for definition was never seen."


Pietro Baracchi recorded "pB; S; R; gbM.  5 small stars from 15 to 16 mag precede closely to the nebula." (10 Jan 1886, Melbourne).

48" (2/21/12): very bright large spiral, elongated ~5:2 NNW-SSE, ~2.4'x0.9'.  Contains a large, very bright core that increases to a stellar nucleus.  Forms an interacting pair (Arp 89) with MCG +02-22-006 2.4' SE of center.  NGC 2648 has an asymmetric appearance with the south-southeast arm stretched into a faint tidal tail.  The brighter portion of the arm extends south-southeast of the core (in the direction of the major axis), but a faint thinner extension curves and sweeps east, fading out just before connecting with MCG +02-22-006.  A mag 11 star is 1.9' E.


The companion appeared moderately bright, edge-on 5:1 WNW-ESE, 1.0'x0.2', sharply concentrated with a very small, bright nucleus.  The system was classified by Arp under "spiral with a large high surface-brightness companion on arms".

William Herschel discovered NGC 2648 = H III-49 = h521 = h3135 on 19 Mar 1784 (sweep 177) and recorded "F, S, with a nucleus.  I had some doubts but 240 confirmed the reality."  On 18 Mar 1786 (sweep 538) he logged "F, lE from np to sf, cS. Almost like two joined together."  John Herschel reported from South Africa, "pB; lE; psmbM; precedes a star 10m."


R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" on 23 Feb 1857, described NGC 2648 as "E np sf, mbM."  In addition he noted and sketched a second nebula, "I think Alpha is a very faint ray though likely to be taken at first for a star."  The diagram clearly reveals that Alpha -- drawn as a small nebula extending WNW-ESE -- is CGCG 060-036 = PGC 24469.  The full description and sketch was not included in LdR's 1861 monograph, so JH was unaware when he compiled the GC and Dreyer skipped CGCG 060-036 when compiling the NGC.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2655 = H I-288 = h520 on 26 Sep 1802 (sweep 1111, his second to last sweep) and recorded "vB, cL, lE, suddenly mbM.  I suspect it to be a cl of star."  CH's reduced position is 5' north of UGC 5152.  On 21 Aug 1828 (sweep 170), John Herschel wrote, "vB; lE; in parallel; psmbM, to a nucl = a * 12m; 30".  Has a L * p and another f, at a considerable distance."  Horace Tuttle independently found the galaxy on 8 Apr 1850 with the 15-inch Merz refractor at the Harvard College Observatory and it was reported as HC 12 in the AN #1453 discovery list.  The HCO position is accurate.


According to Michael Hoskin's "Unfinished Business: William Herschel’s Sweeps for Nebulae", NGC 2655 = H I-288, NGC 2908 = H III-977 and NGC 3057 = H III-978 were the last three entries in his third catalogue to officially bring the total to 500 -- added after Herschel's third catalogue had been sent to the Royal Society for publication in 1802.  A month after submission, Caroline discovered that only 497 objects were included and on 26 Sep 1802, Herschel found 6 new nebulae.  Three of these (including NGC 2655) were added by Caroline to the catalogue, and three were saved for a possible additional catalogue.  A few nights later (30 Sep 1802) WH discovered 4 more nebulae but these along with 3 from earlier years that were overlooked were added at the last minute to the proofs to bring the actual total to 510, as WH was finished with his sweeps.

It is circular and without a nucleus."  There is nothing at his position, but 28 sec of RA west and 1' north is UGC 4584.  The "pB star" is 1' west.


In the GC, JH remarked "I find a memorandum to the effect that this neb is lost and was probably a comet, but I cannot recover my authority for the statement.  It is described by H. as "of the last degree of faintness," and it is therefore no way surprising that it should not have been again pereceived without some time and trouple bestowed, and in clear weather."  Biguordan found this galaxy on 8 Mar 1886 and measured an accurate position.  In the remarks section of his second Comptes Rendus list, Bigourdan noted B. 38 was identical  to GC 1696 [NGC 2661], which has an error of 28 seconds in RA.

Another group of ~10 stars is scattered over a 5' region to the NW of the bright star.  This group was visually uninspiring and appears to be an asterism.


18" (2/23/06): the only possible candidate near John Herschel's original position is a mag 11.7 star and a group of five mag 13.5-14.5 stars close south.  Four of the stars are strung along a 5' gently curving arc.  To the northeast is a much brighter 10' string of a half dozen stars that extends towards the northeast.  Neither of these asterisms, though, are probably eye-catching enough to be mentioned as a "course cluster".  Note:  Based on more recent historical investigation, this identification is incorrect.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2666 = h525 on 19 Mar 1828 (sweep 139) and simply noted "The chief * of a coarse cluster."  He made no mention of size, but there are no other objects matching his description nearby.  Karl Reinmuth remarked "nothing like a cluster" in his NGC photographic survey based on Heidelberg plates.


In Jun 2016 Harold Corwin checked JH's sweep record again and found "JH accidentally copied the reduced NPD of the preceding object in the sweep (a double star) into the column for the reduced NPD of this cluster.  The difference in the NPD index between the two objects is 2d 21' 18", leading to a corrected position for JH's "chief *" of 08 38 14.8, 44 40 27 (NPD, 1830) or 08 49 49, +44 42.3 (J2000), very close to the position of the SAO star.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2667 on 18 Feb 1862 while observing and measuring NGC 2672.  His single position is not very accurate, but 7 seconds of time east is CGCG 090-016, the brighter of pair of galaxies.  Max Wolf found NGC 2667, as well as the companion 1.6' NNE on Heidelberg plates and catalogued both galaxies (IC 2410 and 2411) without reference to NGC 2667.  So, NGC 2667 = IC 2410 and NGC 2667B = IC 2411. CGCG (090-016) and MCG (+03-23-007) both label this galaxy as IC 2410, without reference to NGC 2667.


Interestingly, Ralph Copeland, observing NGC 2667 with the 72" on 26 Dec 1873 noted "cF, pS, lE p f, was thought to have an eF companion about 2' nf."  The companion is clearly IC 2411.  Dreyer later reobserved the field in 1876 and apparently was not convinced: "eF; I think it is only a *16 m +/- nf." Due to Dreyer's uncertainty, IC 2411 missed receiving a NGC designation.

14" (4/3/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 178x): fairly rich group of ~60 stars in a 6' or 7' region, elongated N-S. Includes a mix of brighter mag 9.5-11 stars, along with a number of faint mag 14-15 stars.  A mag 9.5 star and five mag 11-12 in a 1.5' N-S string, is on the northeast side.  The cluster is bounded by a striking number of very bright stars including mag 7.6 HD 75105 off the southwest side, mag 8.2 HD 75227 and mag 7.7 HD 75202 off the north side, and mag 8.6 HD 75167 off the south side (20" pair with a mag 11 star).  The group spans at least 12' to 14' if you include these bright stars.  Located ~55' E of IC 2391 (surrounding mag 3.6 Omicron Velorum).


John Herschel discovered NGC 2669 = h3140 on 11 Apr 1834 and recorded "Cluster VIII class.  A L, poor, loose cl of stars, 10...13m."  The position was noted as very uncertain, with the RA to the nearest (+/-) minute. There is nothing resembling even a poor cluster near his position.  Dreyer credited Persian astronomer Al-Sûfi with the discovery of NGC 2669, but Al-Sûfi mentioned IC 2391 instead.


According to Archinal and Hynes in "Star Clusters", in 1930 Robert Trumpler found the most likely candidate for Herschel's missing cluster.  He noted "NGC 2669 - Declination of NGC corrected by +1°.", which corresponds with ESO 165-SC5.  This cluster fits JH's description though Archinal comments that several of the stars are brighter than mag 10...13.  He also mentions that Harvard 3 (from Shapley's 1930 Monograph on star clusters) refers to a part of NGC 2669.

Roughly two dozen stars mag 10-12 are arranged in a "wishbone" arrangement with a distinctive string of stars running SW-NE with the brightest mag 9 star on the SW end, with another string running E-W and a third side running N-S.  The group is ~6' in diameter.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 2671 = D 489 = h3141 on 1 May 1826 and recorded "a very faint nebula, about 6' diameter, with small stars scattered in it - in the milky way."  Dunlop made 2 observations and his position is just 2' SSE of center.  JH made a single observation on 2 Mar 1835 and logged "a pretty rich, irregularly round cluster, not mbM, stars 12..13th mag, place that of the general middle."  JH noted D 489 and D 490 as possible equivalences, though D 490 appears to describe Tr 10 = Cr 203: "very large cluster of pretty bright stars, coarsely scattered, about 1° diameter, following a star 5th magnitude, 396 Argus (Bode)."

William Herschel discovered NGC 2672 = H II-48 = H II-80 = h526 on 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 169) and recorded "a nebula r[esolvable], pL, lbM then towards the extremes and contains one star following the brightness and very near to it."  His position is off by nearly 15' (the reference star was a large distance away) and the nearby star he mentions is the close companion NGC 2673.  Dreyer noted in his 1912 publication of WH's catalogues, that "there was some doubt about the contraction of the rope in Sw. 169, hence in the error in the P.D. of II.48."   One week later he recorded II-80 on sweep 181 as "pB, pL, E, r. I can see 2 or 3 stars in it."  In this sweep his position was accurate to within 2', so the identification is certain.  Another observation of II-80 was on 13 Feb 1787 (sweep 698): "pB, E from a few degrees sp to nf.  The greatest brightness lays to the preceding side, it resembles a small one with another much smaller close to it nf [NGC 2673] with resolvable nebulosity around it."  In this sweep he mentioned he looked for II-48, but couldn't find it.


Coincidentally, John Herschel discovered a very faint galaxy (h527 = NGC 2677 = CGCG 090-021) on 17 Mar 1831 that he assumed was his father's H. II-48.  On 19 Dec 1848, George Stoney discovered NGC 2673, a close companion to NGC 2672 -- noted as a star by both Herschels -- with LdR's 72", but he thought it was h527.  In the GC, JH still listed H II-48 under the entry for NGC 2677 (GC 1707). Finally, in the GC Supplement, Dreyer suggested II-48 = II-80 and they were equated in the NGC.

At 450x, the tiny nucleus occasionally brightens to a stellar point.  A mag 14 star is just 50" SE.  The pair is generally considered an interacting pair, resulting in a faint plume (not seen) extending to the southeast of NGC 2673.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 2673 (eastern component of the double system with NGC 2672) on 19 Dec 1849. He noted a "close double nebula, small star preceding." On 9 Feb 1855, R.J. Mitchell gave a more detailed description but incorrectly assumed NGC 2673 was h527 = NGC 2677: "very close, almost touching; h526 [NGC 2672] is mbM, h527 is smaller and lbM."  Dreyer later added the note "the latter is not h527, but the close companion to [NGC 2673], viz [GC] 1705."  Interestingly, it's possible that both Herschels noted NGC 2673 in their observations, but thought it was a very faint star.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 2674 = LM 1-152 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded "mag 16.0, 0.4' dia, neb?"  There is nothing at or near his rough position (nearest min of RA) and Herbert Howe was unable to find it on two nights at Stone's position using the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory around 1900.


Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 2674 probably refers to PGC 24785, a faint galaxy located 1.2 min of RA due east of Stone's position.  As the Leander McCormick positions in the first list are often off in RA, this identification is fairly certain.  RNGC classifes NGC 2674 as nonexistent and NGC 2674 was not included in the first edition of the "Deep Sky Field Guide" to the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas.

This object (a 5" pair of mag 15.1/16.2 stars) is smaller and fainter than NGC 2679 and appears nearly stellar with just 0.2' separation between the pair and the center of NGC 2679.


Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 2680 on 26 Feb 1851. He recorded an "exceeding close double nebula [with NGC 2679]."  A total of 9 observations were made at Birr Castle, generally describing a very close double nebula within a common envelope or a nebula with a double nucleus.  For example, Sir Robert Ball's description on 12 Jan 1867 reads "Double nebula in Pos 85.5°, preceding on cB, R, mbM, following one F, R, perhaps with a * in the middle."


UGC (4632) calls this a double system (NGC 2679 + 2680) with a "companion superimposed at 0.2' following center, 0.20'x0.15'."  The DSS reveals two, very close stellar objects (northern component brighter) at the east edge of NGC 2679.  These are individually catalogued in NED as NGC 2680 NED01 ("Southern of two compacts (or stars?) superposed on NGC 2679") and NGC 2680 NED02 ("Northern of two compacts (or stars?) superposed on NGC 2679").  NED also has a single entry for NGC 2680 = KPG 176B (from the Karachentsev Isolated Pairs of Galaxies catalogue) at their mean position.  LEDA has a single entry for NGC 2679 = NGC 2680, but no individual entry(s) for NGC 2680.  On the SDSS DR8, two stellar objects just east of the nucleus of NGC 2679 are superimposed.  The northern "star" is classified as a galaxy and the southern component as a star.


After a query from Ivan Maly, I sent an email to Brian Skiff on 3/10/14 asking about the classification of these two objects and he quickly responded, "These are both stars.  I just examined numerous available images using the Goddard SkyView utility (GALEX, DSS, SDSS DR7 and DR8, 2MASS; no UKIDSS coverage unfortunately). Simply doing a blink-comparison of the POSS-I and -II blue plates (POSS-I red has less-good resolution), it is obvious that the northern star of the pair has modest proper motion, while the southern one is essentially fixed.  (I used 'SAOimage ds9' for this.)  Large-scale cut-outs of the Sloan images show no indication that they are other than stars, and the relative motion shows they are unrelated to each other.  Using the SDSS DR7 catalogue, I get V magnitudes 15.1 and 16.2, and separation of 4".66 in pa 192.2 deg for the two stars (epoch 2003.967).  At the epoch of POSS-I the position-angle is close to 180 deg, so presumably in Lord Rosse's time the fainter star would have been to the southeast."

Johann Gottfried Koehler (discoverer of M50 and M60) discovered M67 = NGC 2682 = h531 before 1779 and recorded "A rather conspicuous nebula in elongated figure, near Alpha of Cancer."  Messier independently discovered it on 6 Apr 1780 and logged "Cluster of small stars with nebulosity, below the southern claw of Cancer. The position determined from the star Alpha [Cancri]."  William Herschel first observed the cluster on 26 Mar 1783 using his 6-inch and simply noted a "cluster of stars."  With his 18-inch in 1784 he described "a most beautiful cluster of stars; not less than 200 in view."

13.1" (1/18/85): moderately bright, fairly small edge-on 4:1 SW-NE.  Contains an elongated bright core.  A mag 11 star is 2.4' N of center.  The well-known polar ring was not seen.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2685 = T VI-8 on 18 Aug 1882 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory. His position is ~30 sec of RA too far east and 3' too far north, but the identification is certain.

18" (4/26/08): this member of the compact NGC 2684 group appeared very faint, very small, either elongated or double oriented E-W.  I had a strong impression this was a very close pair; sometimes a single round galaxy was visible but at other moments it was elongated E-W or the fainter companion momentarily popped into view.  The DSS shows a double galaxy just 16" between centers with the eastern component fainter.  Located 1.4' SE of NGC 2684 and 0.9' SW of a mag 12.5 star.  NGC 2687 is just 1.4' NE

17.5" (3/16/96): picked up while viewing NGC 2684. Extremely faint, very small, appears elongated 2:1 E-W.  Located 1.3' SE of NGC 2684 and requires concentration to view. The mag 13 star mentioned in the observation of NGC 2684 is 0.9' NE.  This is an (unresolved) double system with the components oriented E-W. The fainter eastern member is designated NGC 2686B.  Member of a group of faint galaxies along with NGC 2687.


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 2686 on 11 Mar 1858 using Lord Rosse's 72" (along with NGC 2687, 2688 and 2689), while observing the field of NGC 2684.  He described it as "double or is a neb with hazy * close f" and labeled it on the sketch as Beta.  MCG +08-16-036/037 is a double galaxy and the orientation on the sketch (E-W) is correct, so this identification is certain.  RNGC and MCG have separate listings for NGC 2686A and B.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 2687 on 11 Mar 1858 using Lord Rosse's 72" (along with NGC 2686, 2688 and 2689), while observing the field of NGC 2684.  There was no description given (or approximate offsets from NGC 2684), so JH gave a single position in the GC for NGC 2686, 2687 and 2688.  The sketch, though, shows NGC 2687 east or slightly ESE of NGC 2684, with a star just preceding NGC 2687.

18" (4/26/08): this is the faintest of 6 galaxies viewed in the compact NGC 2684 group.  It was a marginal observation (barely glimpsed several times) with averted vision 2.7' NE of a mag 10.7 star.  It was necessary to keep this distracting star out of the field.  Slightly easier NGC 2688 lies 2.3' WNW


17.5" (3/8/97): not found.


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 2689 on 11 Mar 1858 at Birr Castle. It was indicated on the sketch of the NGC 2684 field published in the 1880 Monograph, along with NGC 2686, NGC 2687 and NGC 2688.  Dreyer reobserved the field in 1878, but he noted the "sky is very bad" and the novae were not seen.


John Herschel only included three of the four novae in the GC (1715/1716/1717), so one was left out, but Dreyer assigned NGC 2689 to the 4th nebula in the NGC. Based on the sketch, NGC 2689 can be matched with LEDA 2333935.  This is the faintest known galaxy (V = 16.3-16.4) discovered at Birr Castle, according to Wolfgang Steinicke.


RNGC and PGC misidentify PGC 25042 (at 08 55 15.5 +49 09 04) as NGC 2689.  NED and HyperLEDA equate NGC 2689 with PGC 2333935. The identifications of NGC 2688 and NGC 2689 are discussed by Malcolm Thomson in his Catalogue Corrections.

Multiple observations were made in the next couple of years (13 total) but John Herschel didn't include this nebula in the General Catalog, presumably as no details were given in the 1861 monograph. So, Dreyer added it in the GC supplement (GC 5435).

Due to a very poor position by Stone, this galaxy is not generally identified as NGC 2696 (4 tmin error in RA) is not plotted on U2000 (version 2) atlas.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 2696 = LM 1-153 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory and recorded as "mag 15.8, 0.2' dia, stellar nucleus."  There is nothing near his rough position (nearest min of RA).  Harold Corwin suggests this may be MCG -01-23-004, in which case Stone's RA would be 4 minutes too large (as often the case with L M observations, the dec is fairly accurate but the RA is very poor).  So, this is an uncertain but very plausible identification.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

He placed this object 4' NE of NGC 2699 and a mag ~15.5 star is at this position.

But this offset points exactly to the mag 15.5 star.


RNGC and PGC (as well as other sources based on these catalogues such as Megastar) misidentify PGC 25072 as NGC 2702.  This galaxy is 4.4' N of NGC 2699 but 11 tsec preceding.

Dreyer looked for Tempel's "nova" on 4 Mar 1877 at Birr Castle and reported "looked carefully for nova Tempel [NGC 2703] between [[NGC 2698] and [NGC 2708], saw none, only about midways vF double star, which I first mistook for a nebula."  Ironically, the double star was probably Tempel's "nova"!  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel" called it a "? Neb *14 [not nebulous], *14.5 sp vnr."

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2707 around 1876, along with NGC 2700/2702/2703/2705.  All of these numbers probably apply to faint stars he found while observing the NGC 2695-2698 Group with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri observatory!   A mag 15 star (GSC 4869-855) is close to the NGC position at 08 56 05.5 -03 04 00 (J2000), though this identification is uncertain.  In 1915, Knox-Shaw reported NGC 2705 was not found on Helwan photographs.

This galaxy is an interacting pair with tidal bridge, but the companion was too faint to detect.  NGC 2718, at 180 million light-years distant is similar to the Milky Way — with two dwarf-galaxy satellites (UGC 4703) like the Magellanic Clouds.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2719 = H III-540 = h541 on 28 Mar 1786 (sweep 549) and recorded "vF, S, lE, seems to contain 2 vF stars."  His position is 11 seconds of RA too far west, but the description is accurate.  On a second sweep he apparently added "E 20 degrees np-sf." and this implies the south-following star is certainly NGC 2719A.

NGC 2736 = ESO 260-14 = RCW 37 = Herschel's Ray = Pencil Nebula

09 00 17 -45 56 54; Vel

Size 30'x7';  PA = 20°


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): Herschel's Ray was a striking, bright filament at 130x and a UHC or OIII filter, extending SSW-NNE for at least 20' in length.  Herschel's Ray is brightest along a 5' stretch at the NNE end as it passes to the west of mag 8.3 HD 774433 and continues NNE ending to the west of a mag 9.5 star.  Several very faint stars appear to very close to the northern half of the ray, particularly along the eastern edge, though a mag 11.2 star is also at the western edge.  The ray weakens or thins to a narrow splinter just the east of this mag 11.2 star.  At the NNE tip the filament subtly bends very slightly towards the north and at the SSW end the filament more obviously curves or hooks slightly towards the south as it fades.


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): Herschel's Ray was easily picked up at 105x using a UHC filter.  It extended well over 1/2 of the 38' field, at least 20'x2', oriented SSW-NNE.  This prominent Vela Supernova filament is brightest towards the NNE end near a mag 8.3 star which is just following the NNE edge.  It appears like a thin splinter of light through the field with a weak filamentary structure and variations in brightness, similar to one of the fainter filaments in the Veil nebula.  Several stars are very close to the edge including a mag 11 star near the middle.  I was impressed the appearance was very comparable to the view I had through the 18-inch in Australia.


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an isolated bright eastern filament in the Vela Supernova remnant which is centered over 4° to the west.  At 128x and UHC filter (38 arcmin field), it appears as a fairly faint, thin, nebulous streak extending SSW-NNE over half the field, ~20'x1'!  The surface brightness is roughly uniform, though the northern portion is brighter near a mag 8.3 star off the NE end.  The nebulosity continues past this star and ends with a mag 9.5 star due east of the NNE tip.  On the SSW end the nebulosity gradually dims out.  A few mag 11 stars border the filament, one just off the west edge near the center and a couple further south.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2736 = h3145 on 1 Mar 1835 and recorded "eeF, L, vvmE; an extraordinary long narrow ray of excessively feeble light; position 19 deg±.  At least 20' long, extending much beyond the limits of the field...".  His position and sketch (Plate V, figure 12) agrees perfectly with ESO 260-N14, the brightest piece of the huge Vela SNR, centered ~ 5 degrees WNW.


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 2736 on 26 Jan 1876 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (plate IV, figure 34 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_4_34.php).  Besides a thin ray, he also saw nebulosity spreading out from the southern end towards the west.  In Jan 1885, Barachi commented, "Extremely faint, a long streak across the field, straight, very narrow, with a peculiar group of stars in the n.f. quadrant, forming almost a semicircle, of which the north portion of the streak is the diameter. Streak spreads out at its s.p. end, and becomes a large irregular-shaped whitishness, without distinct contour, which the eye cannot see except by moving the telescope up and down, and only when the back ground is perfectly black and free from haze; even then it requires a little time before it can be seen."


RNGC and NGC 2000.0 misclassify this filament  as a galaxy and I mentioned this error in RNGC Corrections #5.  The first reported connection of NGC 2736 with the Vela SNR was in 2000: http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v543n2/005648/005648.html, two years after the discovery of the SNR itself in 1998.  Estimated age of the supernova is 9-11,000 years.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2753 on 21 Feb 1863 with the 11-inch Merz-refractor at the Copenhagen observatory.  There is nothing at his position (#87 in AN 1500), though he noted a mag 13-14 star was 40" northwest.  Exactly 1 min of time east of his position is CGCG 121-020 = PGC 25603, matching his description.  He mentioned that he couldn't find this nebula again on nights #173 and 229, so the first position was clearly a recording or copying error.

17.5" (2/8/97): this is a faint, close triple star (components mag 15) located 1.3' W of NGC 2758.  In my observation of NGC 2758, this triple appeared nebulous and I sketched it as a probably nonstellar companion (slightly elongated with a nearly stellar core)!  Howe identifies a wider pair close NW as NGC 2757.


Frank Muller discovered NGC 2757 = LM 2-409 in 1886 with the 26" and recorded "mag 15.0, 2nd of 3 [with NGC 2754 and 2758]; *?".  His position is just 0.1 min of RA west of NGC 2758.  There is no galaxy near this offset and Herbert Howe, observing with the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory in Denver, found only an extremely faint double star, dist 12".  Harold Corwin proposes a closer triple star (Muller would have easily resolved the coarser double) at 09 05 25.7 -19 02 52.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 2760 = Sw. VI-34 on 26 Mar 1887.  There is nothing at his position and Bigourdan came up empty. His description mentioned "nearly between an 8 and 9 mag star". About 10' NW of his position is a wide pair of mag 13.6/15.5 stars at 35" separation which are at the midpoint of two mag 9/10 stars matching Swift's description - but the pair seems too wide to be confused as nebulous.


Harold Corwin suggests CGCG 350-021 as a possible candidate, although the flanking stars are mag 11.  Also, this galaxy is 8.5 min of RA further east and 9' north of Swift's position.  More recently (2014) he suggested CGCG 350-016, which is about a half-degree south of Swift's position and 1 min 30 sec west.  Because of the large uncertainties, I'm listing this number as not found. See Corwin's notes.

At first I was inclined to think it double, but with 320 it exhibited a uniform round disc; nor did a friend to whom I showed it see any division. Stars to-night perfectly well defined. In a field with leading stars, or which a diagram was made." On 7 Feb 1837 (his third observation of the planetary), he noted "Viewed past meridian. It occurs in a field with about 40 stars. Diameter 4" or 5" at the utmost; 10" is too large certainly. Very like that of sweep 771 [NGC 2452].  But now the night is good and it bears magnifying. With 320 power the disc is dilated into a dim hazy round nebula; yet there is a peculiarity in its appearance which completely separates it from all nebulae of the same size.

24" (3/9/13): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 1.7'x0.7', fairly sharply concentrated with a very bright core that increases to a small, intense nucleus.  The extension (spiral arm) to the northwest is brighter.  Forms a striking double system (Arp 283) with NGC 2799 1.5' ESE.  UGC 4904 lies 5' S and appears as a fairly faint glow, slightly elongated NW-SE, 25"x20", weak concentration.  The trio forms KTG 22.


17.5" (4/6/91): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, very small bright core, stellar nucleus.  A mag 14 star is 1.6' NNE of center.  Forms a double system (interacting) with NGC 2799 1.5' ESE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2798 = H II-708 on 14 Jan 1788 (sweep 797) and noted "pB, S, stellar."  His position is 3.5' too far southeast.  Nearby NGC 2799 was first seen at Birr Castle.

Ralph Copeland, observing on the 72", discovered NGC 2799 on 9 Mar 1874.  While observing NGC 2798 he recorded "F, cL, vmE 125.9°, pos 102.7°, dist 97.9" from [NGC 2798] or 8.7s f, 21.5" s.  The offsets and description are a perfect match with UGC 4909.  The NGC position is offset to the southeast as Dreyer used WH's poor position for NGC 2798.

18" (2/9/08): this mag 14.5 star was mistakenly thought to be possibly nebulous by Dreyer.  At 225x it appeared clearly as a faint star 2.4' W of NGC 2809 and a similar distance NNW of NGC 2807.


PGC 26212 is = MCG +03-24-030 is misidentified as NGC 2806 in RNGC, MCG and PGC. For completeness, these are my observations of PGC 26212:


18" (3/4/08): very faint, very small, round, 15".  Located 50" WSW of NGC 2807 and about a half-magnitude fainter.


18" (2/9/08): extremely faint, very small, round, 15".  Forms a very close pair with NGC 2807 (just 50" between centers) with NGC 2809 just 3.2' NE.


17.5" (3/12/94): extremely faint and small.  Just visible at moments with averted vision just west of the south edge of NGC 2807 forming a close double system (separation 49").  NGC 2809 lies 3.3' NE.  This galaxy is incorrectly identified as NGC 2806 in the RNGC, MCG and DSFG and NGC 2807 in the second version of the DSFG.


Dreyer discovered NGC 2806 using Lord Rosse's 72" on 22 March 1876 and recorded "A vF * or cS, eF neb p [NGC 2809] (sky bad), forming an equilateral triangle with [2807] and [2809] (susp as neb by d'A, = [NGC 2806])."  At his position is a mag 14.5 star at 09 16 56.7  +20 04 14 (2000).  This star forms an equilateral triangle with NGC 2807 and NGC 2809 and lies due west of NGC 2809.  Since his descriptions and offsets for other objects in the field are exact, there is no mistaking the identity of NGC 2806 as a single star.  Dreyer noted that d'Arrest also suspected this star to be nebulous on 17 Feb 1862.


RNGC, MCG, Deep Sky Field Guide and Uranometria 2000 Atlas misidentify MCG +03-24-030 as NGC 2806.  MCG +03-24-030 is situated just preceding the south edge of NGC 2806.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 2807 on 17 Feb 1863 while observing NGC 2809.  He noted h578 [NGC 2809] follows by 7 seconds in time and 115" north.  His position (measured on 4 nights) and description matches MCG +03-24-031 = PGC 26213.  Several sources such as RNGC, MCG, Uranometria 2000.0 and Deep Sky Field Guide misidentify MCG +03-24-030 (just 50" WSW) as NGC 2807.  d'Arrest did not mention this galaxy.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this was a stunning showpiece globular in the 24"!  The central region displayed an unusually strong concentration with a super-intense 2' core that was unresolved.  A very bright, small halo surrounded the core, which was mottled but mostly unresolved.  The outer halo resolved into perhaps 150-200 mag 14.5 and fainter stars.  The halo gradually thinned out in resolved stars out to 10' diameter. The core was smaller but still unresolved at 350x.  The overall appearance of the three brightness levels mentioned above is unusually symmetrical.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this bright globular (ranked 10th brightest at V = 6.1) is fairly large, ~10' diameter and very compressed with a blazing 2' core.  The halo is noticeably elongated, nearly 3:2.  A dense swarm of mag 14 and fainter stars were resolved in the halo and around the edges of the core but the inner central core was unresolved.  At 228x, there appeared to be some very faint stars lanes streaming into the halo, which were barely unresolved but looked like small tentacles.  A mag 10/10.6 double at 16" is outside the cluster ~10' ESE.  This is by far the brightest concentration class I globular and the only one easily resolved.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this very bright globular was large and elongated, ~8'x6' SW-NE increasing to 2' bright core and a blazing 40" nucleus.  At 144x, this cluster was mottled but with no obvious resolution.  At 166x a large number of extremely faint stars (mag 14-15) popped in and out of view over the entire disc, though the resolved stars could not be held steadily.  Located 1.8° NNE of mag 4.0 Alpha Volantis.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): fairly bright but fairly small at 10x.  Contains a very bright small core.  I wasn't confident of a naked-eye sighting.


Naked-eye (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): faintly visible naked-eye.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2808 = D265 = h3152on 7 May 1826 and recorded "a very bright round nebula, about 3' or 4' diameter, very gradually bright to the centre.  This has a fine globular appearance."  His position is 20' too far northwest, but the identity is certain.


John Herschel recorded 4 detailed observations from the Cape of Good Hope: On the first sweep (8 Mar 1834) he logged it as a "globular cluster, extremely compressed pretty gradually very much brighter to the middle; up to a perfect blaze; diam. in RA = 26.8 seconds; stars of 16th magnitude."  His final observation (9 Feb 1837) notes "a truly beautiful and delicate globular cluster; diameter in RA = 45 seconds, that of the most compressed part 15 seconds; gradually very bright in the middle; all finely resolved into perfectly equal stars like the finest dust, which are seen with the left eye without effort, but the right requires to be somewhat strained to discern them. Runs up to a blaze in the centre."

William Herschel discovered NGC 2814 = H II-868 = h576 on 3 Apr 1791 (sweep 1004) and recorded both as "Two nebulae. The first [NGC 2814] F, S, iF, the second [NGC 2820] F, pL, E. The place is that of the second [NGC 2820], the other precedes it about 30 seconds and is nearly in the same parallel."  Dreyer commented in the notes section "Not seen by d'Arrest, and [John Herschel] only observed the following one (II.869)."  Dreyer assigned h576 to NGC 2820 but John Herschel's position on 30 Mar 1832 (sweep 410) corresponds with NGC 2814, and h579 = NGC 2816 is identical to H II-869 = NGC 2820 (see notes on NGC 2816).

John Herschel discovered NGC 2816 = h579 on 30 Mar 1832 (sweep 410) and noted, "F, pmE".  There is nothing at his position and Bigourdan was unable to find a suitable candidate.  Karl Reinmuth reported "not found at Dreyer's place" based on Heidelberg plates and this is repeated by Dorothy Carlson in her 1940 paper on NGC corrections.


Harold Corwin originally suggested this number might be a duplicate observation of NGC 2742 with a 13 minute error in RA (identical declination).  But Wolfgang Steinicke found (based on my questioning about h576) that JH made a large error (of 3 3/4 degrees) in reducing his declination for h579, and once corrected, h579 = NGC 2816 is a duplicate observation of NGC 2820 (discovered earlier by WH).   In addition, h576 refers to nearby NGC 2814 = UGC 4952 (also discovered by WH).  See Corwin's note for the full story.

V = 11.5;  Size 85"x47"


17.5" (3/25/00): NGC 2818 refers to both an open cluster and a superimposed planetary nebula (identified as NGC 2818A in the RNGC).  The moderately bright PN is nestled on the west side of a faint but fairly rich open cluster.  At 220x it appeared moderately bright, irregularly shaped, ~1.0'x0.8' and elongated roughly N-S.  Excellent view at 280x with a UHC filter and unfiltered at 380x.  The rim is irregularly brighter and gave a weak annular appearance; brightest at the south and southwest rim.  The center is slightly darker but there was no well-defined central hole. The outline is not crisp and seemed to change orientation somewhat with averted vision.


13.1" (4/10/86): the cluster appears as a faint group of 25-30 stars mag 12 to 15, over unresolved haze, though good seeing might resolve more.  Includes a fairly faint planetary (NGC 2818A) on the west side.  At 166x using a Daystar 300 filter, the planetary appeared moderately bright and large, elongated ~N-S.  Also responds well to an OIII filter at 79x.


13.1 (1/28/84): the cluster is a faint group of two dozen stars mag 12 and fainter.  The planetary on the west side of the cluster is a pretty sight using a UHC filiter at 79x.  It appeared fairly faint, moderately large, 1.0'x0.8', elongated N-S or SSW-NNE.


The planetary had been assumed to be the only one to be physically associated with an open cluster, although recent research firmly places the planetary in the foreground.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2818 = D 564 = h3154 on May 28 1826 and recorded a "pretty large faint nebula [star cluster] of a round figure, 6' or 8' diameter; the nebulosity is faintly diffused to a considerable extent. There is a small nebula [PN] in the north preceding edge, which is probably a condensation of the faint diffused nebulous matter; The large nebula is resolvable into stars with small nebula remaining."  His position is 15' southwest of the planetary.


John Herschel recorded on 7 Aug 1837 (sweep 787): "A very curious object which reminds me strongly of M46 and IV. 39 [NGC 2438].  It is a rich cluster of the VI class, stars 12..14m; about 8' dia, gpmbM; all but a sort of vacuity, in which is situated a pB, R, neb; 40" diam; of a character approaching to planetary, having its edges shading off very rapidly, and being but very little brighter in the middle."  His sketch is reproduced on plate V, figure 8 of the CGH Observations. A second observation on 22 Jan 1838 (sweep 809) describes the planetary first and the NGC summary refers to the planetary (in a large cluster).  So the number NGC 2818 could apply to the planetary or the cluster.  RNGC lists the cluster as NGC 2818 and the planetary as NGC 2818A.


Joseph Turner (date uncertain) and Pietro Baracchi (15 Jan 1885) sketched NGC 2818 with the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished Plate VI, figure 65).

NGC 2820A dangles just south of the west-southwest edge.  It appeared faint, small, oval 3:2 SSW-NNE, 18"x12", occasional stellar nucleus.  NGC 2814, a smaller edge-on, lies 3.7' W.


17.5" (4/6/91): fairly faint, very thin edge-on 6:1 SW-NE with tapered ends, fairly low surface brightness, no noticeable core.  Forms a contact pair with NGC 2820A 20" off the southwest tip.  The companion is very faint, very small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, very small brighter core.  NGC 2820 is in a group with NGC 2814 4' W and NGC 2805 13' SW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2820 = H II-869 on 3 Apr 1791 (sweep 1004) and recorded both as "Two nebulae. The first [NGC 2814] F, S, iF, the second [NGC 2820] F, pL, E. The place is that of the second, the other precedes it about 30 seconds and is nearly in the same parallel."  Dreyer equated John Herschel's observation of h576 with H II-869 = NGC 2820, but his sweep data (checked by Wolfgang Steinicke) reveals h 576 = H II-868 = NGC 2814.  In addition, h579 = NGC 2816 is identical to NGC 2820, with John Herschel making a 3 3/4 error in reducing the position for h579.  IC 2458, found by Guillaume Bigourdan on 14 Mar 1899, refers to the northeastern end of this galaxy and not the close companion NGC 2820A off the southwest end that is generally identified as IC 2458.

24" (1/31/14): at 375x; LEDA 2036350 appeared very faint to faint (could hold steadily with averted), extremely small, round, 8" diameter.  LEDA 3529523, a larger galaxy, lies 3.5' ENE and appeared faint, small, elongated 5:3 WSW-ENE, 20"x12.


The identification of this galaxy with NGC 2829 is very questionable and based on the discovery sketch, the best match is a mag 14.5 star 2.9' due west.  PGC 26356, a double system 4.6' W, is often taken as NGC 2832, but it is fainter and a poor match with the discovery sketch.  For completeness, my description of PGC 26356 follows.


24" (3/9/13): at 375x; extremely faint (B = 16.8), very small, round, 12" diameter.  Nearly on a line between NGC 2826 1.9' SE and a mag 12.3 star 1.2' NE.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 2829 on 13 Mar 1850, one of "15 knots in all".  It was included on the sketch of 8 Jan 1851, which showed only a dozen nebulae, east of line connecting NGC 2832 and NGC 2826.  The nearest galaxy to the NGC position is PGC 26356, an extremely faint, double galaxy (brighter western component) situated 2' NE of NGC 2826.  RNGC and PGC identify this galaxy as NGC 2829 (as well as secondary sources based on the PGC).  But, PGC 26356 is directly on a line with NGC 2832 and 2826, contradicting Stoney's sketch. Karl Reinmuth description (based on Heidelberg plates) was "identification doubtful, vF, vS, R, vgvlbM, triangle with 2 st nf and f, NGC 2826 sp 2.1'."


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 2829 might apply to LEDA 2036350, a brighter galaxy 4.6' due E of PGC 26356, though this galaxy is only a fair match with Stoney's sketch.  The best fit to Stoney's sketch is a mag 14.5 star at 09 19 38.4 +33 39 12 (2000).  So, the identification of NGC 2829 is uncertain - it may apply to PGC 2036350 (described here), but more likely is just a faint star 2.9' west of this galaxy.  Seligman and Corwin (as of 2019) favor the single star as NGC 2829.

A sketch made the following year only showed a dozen nebulae and NGC 2833 is placed 12' north of NGC 2832 (actual separation is 11').  The NGC position is 6 sec of RA west and 1.5' north of CGCG 181-027.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 2835 on 13 Apr 1884.  E.E. Barnard made an independent discovery in early 1885 while comet-seeking with his 5-inch refractor.  In The Observatory 8, p123, he wrote "very faint, close between two bright stars, the n.p. of which is about 8 mag, the s.f. is about 9 mag.  A 10th mag star is involved in the following edge of the nebula."  His position (determined with the 6-inch equatorial) was accurate.  After the discovery was announced in The Observatory, Wilhelm Tempel claimed an earlier discovery on 13 Apr 1884 in a note to his "New Nebulae" in AN 2660.  Barnard was credited with the discovery in the NGC, as Dreyer apparently missed Tempel's comment.


Based on photographs taken with the Reynolds reflectors at the Helwan Observatory in 1919-20, NGC 2835 was described as "pF, 7'x4', E10°; beautiful 4-branched spiral with faint almost stellar nucleus and many almost stellar condensations along the arms."

The RNGC misclassified the number as nonexistent.


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 2847 one 15 Mar 1855 with LdR's 72", and noted a "F knot np [NGC 2848]". Harold Corwin identifies NGC 2847 as a star and HII region 0.6' NW of the nucleus of NGC 2848.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2859 = H I-137 = h593 on 28 Mar 1786 (sweep 549) and logged "vB, R, vsmbM, chevelure extending to about 3' diameter".  John Herschel made 3 observations, recording on 1 Apr 1831 (sweep 336), "vB; R; vsmbM to a star; follows a * 7m and is 3' S of it."  A total of 11 observations were made by LdR and assistants and a couple of superimposed stars were noted in the outer halo [on the north side].

William Herschel discovered NGC 2863 = H III-520 = h594 on 25 Mar 1786 (sweep 544) and logged "vF, S, E."  On 9 Mar 1828 (sweep 129), John Herschel wrote, "F; extended between 2 stars 12 and 16 m."


Frank Muller independently found this galaxy (and discovered nearby NGC 2868) in 1886 at Leander-McCormick Observatory, and recorded LM 412 as "mag 14.5, 1.2'x0.6', E 170°, gbM, bet 2 st 12 and 14."  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is about 1 min too far east.  Dreyer assumed this was a different 'nebula' and catalogued it again as NGC 2869.  Howe examined the field in 1899-00 and reported the numbers were identical.  So, NGC 2863 = NGC 2869, with NGC 2863 the primary designation.  Because of Muller's poor position, NGC 2868 precedes NGC 2863 in the sky.

Specifically, a bright scattered 10' field centered 10' SSW stands out at low power.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2866 = h3162 on 31 Mar 1835 and noted a "Cluster class VIII.  Place of a small compact knot of st".  His position is an exact match with the small group of stars ESO 212-SC3 = Pismis 13, though because he placed it in class VIII, Herschel meant to include the scattered stars (bright) in the larger field.  Pismis noted "5 bright stars within 1' region."

John Herschel discovered NGC 2867 = h3163 on 1 Apr 1834 (sweep 435) and called it "The finest planetary nebula I ever remember to have seen for sharpness of termination; 3" diameter; exactly R; no more haziness about them than would be about a star of the same magnitude to-night (which is a favourable one) Light, a pale white = * of 9th +/- mag.

A second companion * suspected (at about half the distance of the 1st by diagram, and at an estimated position of 330°) among multitude of large and small stars."  The next night he observed it again with Thomas Maclear, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, while it was out of the meridian, to check if it might be a planet.  But he noted it had "not moved perceptibly, and is therefore not a planet."


Joseph Turner, observing with the 48-inch Melbourne Telescope on 26 Feb 1878, noted the color was a pale bluish, instead of the "pale white" noted by Herschel.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2885 = h599 on 24 Feb 1827 (sweep 59) and recorded, "eF; vS; E in parallel; RA very uncertain."  There is nothing at his position (1.7' NNW of a mag 8 star not mentioned in his description), but 25 seconds of RA west is UGC 5037, which fits the description as the galaxy is elongated roughly east-west.  Bigourdan rediscovered the galaxy while searching at JH's position on 21 Mar 1890, measured an accurate position for Big. 154 (later IC 538) and noted "does not seem to be NGC 2885."  Dreyer mentioned the possible equivalence with NGC 2885 in the IC description.


Sir Robert Ball, an observing assistant on LdR's 72", recorded on 10 Jan 1867, "3 objects seen close together, of which one is probably a nebula, the other possibly also, and third a star?  All these are eF, and would perhaps not be seen unless on so good a night as this is."  From the description, Ball picked up NGC 2885 and probably nearby IC 2474 and CGCG 121-99.


RNGC misidentifies CGCG 122-006 as NGC 2885.  CGCG and UGC misidentify IC 2474 as NGC 2885.  Finally, MCG labels NGC 2885 as IC 538.  Malcolm Thomson analyzed the identifications in a Webb Society Quarterly Journal article, July 1990.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fascinating bipolar planetary at 260x using a UHC filter.  A very bright knot is situated on the SW end with fainter extensions along the rim to the SE.  A matching knot with a lower surface brightness is on the north side.  This knot is also elongated, making another short arc.  Overall, NGC 2899 is noticeably elongated with dimensions of ~1.6'x1.0', oriented NW-SE.  At 520x both knots or arcs gradually increase in brightness to their centers and occasionally show very faint stellar nuclei.  The overall surface is noticeably mottled at this power, though darker in the center.  The open cluster IC 2488 lies 50' S.

48" (4/18/15): this superb spiral was observed at 375x.  Several luminous patches were visible along the central bar, which trends SSW-NNE, including a patch (NGC 2905) at the northeast end near the beginning of the western spiral arm.  Another patch is at the south end of the core with a third near the southern end of the bar where the outer eastern arm emanates.  The outer western arm extends south for a length of ~4', just beyond the southern edge of the main body.  The outer eastern arm emerges from the south end of the galaxy, curls east and shoots north. Although the surface brightness becomes quite low, the arm extends well beyond the main body for a total length of ~7'!  At the northern end is a low surface brightness larger patch about 5.5' NE of center.  The tips of the spiral arms are over 9' apart.


24" (2/22/14): excellent view at 200x and 375x.  This beautiful barred spiral is sharply concentrated with an extremely bright, mottled core.  A prominent central bar runs along the major axis, extending ~2'x0.4' SSW-NNE.  The central bar is the brightest portion of an more oval, brighter central region, ~2.0'x1.0'.  Just beyond the northeast end of the central bar is a bright, irregular "knot" (NGC 2905) where the northern spiral arm attaches.  This arm bends sharply to the west (clockwise), but only curves for ~1' and quickly fades, as if it was angled towards us.  A prominent arm (more cleanly separated from the central region) is attached at the south-southwest end of the bar where there is another brighter, irregular "knot".  The southern arm bends east and then north, paralleling the orientation of the bar and extending as far north as the core, perhaps just beyond a mag 13.7 star 2' ESE of center. A darker dust lane separates this arm from the central region.


18" (2/14/10): beautiful view of this barred spiral at 175x.  The galaxy extends 2:1 SSW-NNE, roughly 8'x4', with a slightly brighter bar running through the major axis.  The center is sharply concentrated with a very bright clumpy core.  At the SSW end of the main body a faint arm emerges and sweeps around to the east.  Near the NNE end of the central bar is a brighter knot (NGC 2905) and beyond the knot is a fainter and less defined arm that curves around a short distance to the west.


17.5" (1/31/87): this is one of the brightest non-Messier galaxies.  Very bright and large, elongated 5:2 SSW-NNE, 10'x4'.  A very faint knot is involved on the NNE side 1.2' from center = NGC 2905.  An extremely faint knot is also symmetrically placed opposite the core on the SW end 1.2' from center.  The galaxy has a dusty, mottled appearance with knots and arcs easily visible with averted vision.


17.5" (3/23/85): a second knotty region is definitely visible on the SW edge.  Lord Rosse mentions these two knots as "thickened regions".


13.1" (12/22/84): very bright, elongated bright core.  Contains a very faint knot at the north end = NGC 2905.

John Herschel recorded on sweep 244, "I. 56 is vB; E; gbM; r[esolvable].  Long attentions shows a vF, L, R, neb attached n f."  NGC 2905 = h604.II is the "neb attached n f" and refers to the northeast spiral arm (or a brighter region in the spiral arm).


Lord Rosse first observed this galaxy on 24 Mar 1846 and noted "a tendency to an annular or spiral arrangement discovered."  He commented the night was bad, though.  NGC 2903 was probably the second galaxy (after M51) in which spiral structure was noted. On 9 Mar 1848 Romney Robinson, director of Armagh Observatory and a regular observer at Birr Castle, commented "Night excellent, a spiral seen in an oblique direction, resolved well, particularly towards the vB centre."  LdR was a bit more conservative in his assessment of spiral structure and didn't include this galaxy in his table of 16 spirals in the 1850 Philosophical Transactions paper, though a published sketch from 5 Mar 1848 shows multiple spiral arms with a knot embedded (NGC 2905).  Dreyer later commented, "the engraving does not agree with the numerous sketches taken later..."


William Lassell published three different sketches of NGC 2903 made in 1862 with his 48-inch on Malta. (plate II, Fig. 12).  They all showed a "wavy" or curved body with "hooks" at the ends of the spiral arms.

48" (4/18/15): NGC 2905 is the brightest of several luminous patches along the central bar.  This irregular knot is located very near the north-northeast end of the central bar at the point where two spiral arms (extending west) emerge from the arm.


24" (2/22/14): just beyond the northeast end of the central bar is a fairly bright, irregular "knot" (NGC 2905) where the northern spiral arm attaches to the bar.  This arm bends sharply to the west (clockwise), but only curves for ~1' and quickly fades.


17.5" (5/10/86): very large knot or arc at the NNE edge of a spiral arm in NGC 2903.  Easily visible with averted vision.


13.1" (12/22/84): very faint knot or arc at NE edge of arm of NGC 2903.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2905 = H I-57 = h604.II on 16 Nov 1784 (sweep 318) and recorded (together with NGC 2903) "cB, cL, a small bright spot in the middle; at first sight appears very much elongated, but by careful attention it appears to consist of two; the nf of which less bright than the sp, though nearly of the same size and shape with the former, it has also a brightish spot in the middle but not nearly so brilliant as the other; dist of the center about a minute."


On 25 Mar 1830 (sweep 244), John Herschel recorded, "[NGC 2903] is vB; E; gbM; r[esolvable].  Long attentions shows a vF, L, R, neb attached n f."  NGC 2905 is the "neb attached n[orth] f[ollowing]" and refers to a brighter starcloud of large HII region in the northeast spiral arm.  George Stoney's sketch at Birr Castle on 5 Mar 1848 shows multiple spiral arms, along with a distinct embedded knot on the northeast side.  RNGC classified this number as nonexistent (Type 7), although Type 35 = nebulous region in a galaxy, would probably be more appropriate.

17.5" (2/20/88): mag 14.3 star situated 3.6' NE of NGC 2911.  Misidentified as a "nova" by Schultz.


Herman Schultz discovered NGC 2912 on 3 Apr 1870 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory and recorded "eF; follows h608 [NGC 2911] some seconds about 2' N; but not observable".  I'm not sure of the meaning of his last comment but 1.3' ENE of NGC 2911 is PGC 27167, an extremely faint and small, low surface brightness galaxy, which the RNGC identifies as NGC 2912.


But this galaxy is too faint to be included in the CGCG and MCG and is extremely unlikely to have been seen by Schultz with a 9.6" scope.  I missed detecting this galaxy in my 17.5" and it was not found by Bigourdan, though of course it was not difficult in Lowrey's 48".  Instead, Corwin suggests NGC 2912 more likely refers to a mag 14.3 star 3.6' NE of NGC 2911.

NGC 2915 is classified as an unusual Blue Compact Dwarf.  A significant percentage of its mass is within an extended neutral hydrogen halo that extends to nearly 20'x12' and within a massive halo of dark matter.


A very faint globular, E3, lies 43' SSW.  At 200x, three faint stars were resolved over a 1' low surface brightness hazy glow with no concentration.  In addition two brighter field stars are situated at the outside edge of the glow.  At 260x, a fourth superimposed star was glimpsed, though these are possibly line of sight stars and perhaps the cluster, itself, was unresolved.  Although situated 43' SSW of NGC 2915 the precise position was pinned down moving 13' W of a mag 7.7 star using a 16" pair of mag 12/14 stars (situated at the midpoint of this line) as a reference.

18" (10/17/17 - OzSky):  This observation, made at 2:30 AM with the object at an elevation of ~20°, completed the entire NGC!  At 91x it took a few minutes to identify the field with certainty as the general region is fairly uniformly rich and no detached Milky Way patches stood out. Using a printed finder chart, I identified a few distinct asterism within this Milky Way star field.  John Herschel referred to a very large field, 1 to 1.5 degrees, but my eye caught a brighter, more condensed region centered about 09 35 15 -46 52 that was noticeably elongated SW-NE and extended ~15'x6'.  At the southwest end was mag 8.6 HD 83152 and at the northeast was mag 9.4 HD 83265.  This group is identified in SIMBAD as [KPS2012] MWSC 1694.


To the east of this grouping is a much smaller 6' string oriented WSW-ENE (centered about 09 36.4  -46 58) with a mag 9.9 star at the WSW tip.  Close  east is mag 8.6 HD 83444 and a curling stream of stars is to its south.  Finally, just to the southwest of this field is mag 7.7 HD 82729 as well as a distinctive 2' group of 4 stars including mag 9.2 HD 82851.


John Herschel discovered NGC 2932 = h3179 on 3 Mar 1837 and recorded "This is about the middle of an enormous cluster of 1 deg or 1.5 deg, very rich in stars of all magnitudes, from 8m downwards, which merits registry as a sort of telescope Praesape.  It may be regarded as a detached portion of the milky way."  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

William Herschel discovered NGC 2938 = H III-963 on 2 Apr 1801 (sweep 1096) and logged "eF, S, iF."  This is one of 15 far northern galaxies with large systematic errors.  A corrected position matching UGC 5115 was published in 1911 using plates taken at the Greenwich Observatory with the 30-inch reflector.  Dreyer repeated this position in the notes to his 1912 edition of WH's catalogues.


By examining the original sweep records, Wolfgang Steinicke found that the irregular errors were a result of the northern sweep not being aligned with the meridian (off in azimuth by 7°).  The reduced positions found by Caroline Herschel, were made of course, assuming a meridian sweep.  Once corrected the identifications of these 15 galaxies is revealed.


John Herschel observed what he assumed was his father's III-963, and recorded h612 as "eF; has a coarse double star 3' following."  His position and description is very close to a mag 15 star.  He used his father's description and added "D * f 3'." in the GC description.  The MN article equates h612 with a faint star preceding the double star.  So, NGC 2938 (= UGC 5115) is only equated with H. III-963, and not h612.

A mag 12 star, superimposed on the western component VV 83a = MCG +06-21-071 is just 30" WSW.  The western component of Arp 129 appeared fairly faint, fairly small, roundish, nearly even surface brightness?  Although easily visible, the view is significantly impaired by the 12th magnitude star and the galaxy was only visible on the east side of the star.


18" (4/14/12): faint to fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:3 E-W, ~30"x18", slightly brighter core.  Arp 63 is a merged double system with a third very faint companion 30" SE, which was not seen.


The double system Arp 129 lies just 3.8' NE.  The eastern component (MCG +06-21-072) appeared faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.  There is a relatively bright star superimposed on the western component (MCG +06-21-072), making confirmation difficult.


17.5" (4/25/98): extremely faint, very small, elongated 2:1 ~E-W, slightly brighter core but overall low surface brightness.  Collinear with two mag 13 stars 3.4' and 4.4' NE.  This double system was not resolved under noticeably hazy sky conditions and soft seeing.  UGC 5146 = Arp 129, another double system, lies 3.7' NE.


Johann Palisa discovered NGC 2944 on 27 Mar 1886 with the 12-inch refractor at the Vienna University Observatory.  His micrometric position in AN 2782 matches UGC 5144.  This is a disrupted double or triple system in contact.  The listed dimensions (from UGC) are for the combined system.  The same night Palisa also discovered NGC 2926 and Samuel Oppenheim discovered NGC 2981.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.


NGC 2944 is in the Arp category of Spiral Galaxies with small, high surface-brightness companions on arms.  Vorontsov-Velyaminov also considered this a pair of galaxies, although VV 82a appears to be double itself.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 2947 = LM 1-156 on 6 May 1886 and reported "mag 15.0, 1.1' dia, iR, gbM."  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), but 2.2 minutes o RA west is MCG -02-25-004 = PGC 27309.  Since this galaxy matches in declination, and the LM positions are generally 1-2 minutes of RA too large, this identification is very likely.


Stephane Javelle independently discovered NGC 2947 on 20 Apr 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at Nice and measured an accurate micrometric position.  Dreyer assumed J. 1-165 was new so it was recatalogued it as IC 547.   Finally, NGC 2947 was independently found by Lewis Swift on 20 Feb 1898, listed as XI-95, and catalogued a third time as IC 2494.  Swift's position was 10 seconds of RA too far west and 3' too far north.  Howe measured an accurate position that was adopted in the IC.  So, NGC 2947 = IC 547 = IC 2494.  MCG labels the galaxy as IC 547, as the position is accurate.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2953 = h3182 on 18 Mar 1836 (along with NGC 2954 = h3181) and noted as a "suspected nebula".  A note was added "These suspicions have been so constantly verified on re-observations, that I have little hesitation in registering it as an object in the catalogue."  Only a rough position was given, but the offset is 6' south of NGC 2954, which was measured on the same sweep and whose position is pretty accurate. There are nothing non-stellar near his position, but within 1' of this offset is a mag 14.5 star (isolated, so there are no other good candidates) and Harold Corwin suggests this is probably the "suspected nebula."  RNGC classifies the number nonexistent.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2973 = h4018 on 5 Feb 1837 and recorded "eF, pS, *8 f[ollowing]."  It was included in a "supplementary nebulae" list at the end of the Cape catalogue (h4016 to h4021) that Dreyer identified as "h o n" (Herschel Omitted Object) in the NGC.  There is no nebula at his position, but nearby is a double star at 09 41 32.4 -30 05 22 (J2000).  In addition, an 8th magnitude star is 4' due east, matching JH's description.  There is also a wider triple star at 09 41 34.7 -30 02 54, which is another candidate.

About three dozen stars are resolved with many of the brighter mag 10.5-11.5 stars in a zig-zag pattern extending west to east.  The brightest mag 10 star on the southeast end forms a wide 30" pair with an 11th mag companion.  Another mag 12.5/13.5 pair at 15" is less than 2' NE.  A 4' line of four mag 11-11.5 stars oriented NW-SE passes through the center and the remaining brighter stars are scattered within the outline.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 2982 = D 468 = h3184 on 24 Jun 1826 and recorded "a very faint easily resolvable nebula, extended about 10' long, and 4' or 5' broad: no central condensation."  His position is 8.5' west of the center of the cluster.


JH probably found the cluster on 28 Feb 1837 and logged "a cluster of about 20* 11m, and 2 of 10m, forming an oblong nearly in parallel; place of preceding *10m".  But no bright star is near his position.  He modified the declination 30' further north when he recorded this object as GC 1910 (repeated by Dreyer in NGC) but this position does not correspond with a cluster either.  But an additional 10' north of the GC/NGC position is this group of brighter stars and his RA matches the southwest member of a wide pair of mag 10 stars at the southeast side of the group.  JH did not list an equivalence with D 468, so he may have felt it was a different object due to the discrepancy in position.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2984 = H III-34 = h633 on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 172) and recorded "vS, the faintest imaginable.  I was a great while before I could verify its being a nebula; however after having convinced myself with 240x, I saw it also very well with 157.  The evening is uncommonly beautiful."  There is nothing at his position (except stars), but 1 min 19 sec of RA west and 3.5' south is UGC 5200.  This is an unusually poor position (observed on only this one sweep).  John Herschel made two observations but didn't measure a good position, so its not clear what object he saw.   Dreyer carried over his poor position into the NGC.


Stephane Javelle independently found the galaxy on 22 Apr 1892 and placed J. 1-168 (later IC 556) accurately.  Karl Reinmuth mentioned he couldn't find NGC 2984 in Dreyer's place using Heidelberg plates and questioned if it was equal to IC 556, probably as there are no other reasonable candidates in the vicinity.

48" (2/19/12): this disrupted galaxy is sharply concentrated with a very bright central region that is elongated ~5:2 SSW-NNE, ~1.0'x0.4'.  The central region is well concentrated with an intense core that brightens to a brilliant nucleus.


I initially noted a faint arm extending 30" SSW of the central region but on a second eyepiece look I noticed this arm is twice that length, though the surface brightness is quite low in the outer portion.  A long, brighter tidal arm stretches 2' NNE, placing the central region off-center along the 3.5' major axis.  This arm or tail has a low surface brightness though brightens in a patch at the NNE end (2.2' NNE of center).  A 2000 multi-wavelength study in AJ,120, 1238 concludes this patch (identified as Arp 245N in NED) is a tidal dwarf galaxy still in the process of formation. The western edge of the arm has a subtle curvature.  With averted vision, extremely low surface brightness haze forms a bridge extending southeast from the core of NGC 2992 towards NGC 2993 (3' between centers).


13.1" (3/24/84): moderately bright, small, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, bright core.  Forms an interacting pair with NGC 2993 2.9' SE.


13.1" (3/3/84): fairly faint, small, roundish, small brighter core.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2992 = H III-277 = h635 on 8 Feb 1785 (sweep 371) and recorded "Two [along with NGC 2993], vF, stellar, the most north and preceding [NGC 2992] is the largest.  240x showed the same.  Distance 3 or 4'.  The place is that of the preceding."  His position was ~45 seconds of RA too large (perhaps only recorded to the nearest min).  John Herschel measured an accurate position on 16 Dec 1827 (sweep 111) and noted "Not vF; R; bM; 30"."  Bindon Stoney noted a mottled appearance with LdR's 72" in 1852.

48" (2/19/12): this is the smaller member of an excellent interacting pair (Arp 245) with NGC 2992 3' NW.  At 488x it appeared very bright, moderately large, sharply concentrated with an intense central core that brightens to a very small brilliant nucleus.  A single spiral arm is attached on the north side of the core and just begins to sweep east, but fades out after a length of ~0.6'.  There is no counterpart on the south side, but extremely faint haze or a bridge can be seen with averted to the northwest of the core, extending towards NGC 2992.  FGC 938, an extremely faint superthin, was glimpsed 3.9' SW.

John Herschel discovered NGC 2995 = h3189 on 5 Apr 1837 and noted a "Cluster VIII class; at least 20* 11m and upwards, and many smaller."  There is no clustering at his position and the ESO and RNGC list the number as "not found" and "nonexistent", respectively.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 2995 may refer to a "clump of stars roughly 20-25 min across centered about 10' north of JH's position."  This scattered group (likely not a cluster) seems to fit JH's description, though its been low on my priority to confirm from the southern hemisphere.

Herbert Howe corrected the RA in his Nov 1900 list of NGC corrections (repeated in the IC 2 notes).

48" (4/22/17): Gorgeous grand-design spiral at 375x!  Appeared very bright and large, with the arms stretching roughly 7' E-W.  The galaxy is sharply concentrated with a round, intensely bright nucleus ~30" diameter.  The spiral arms were sharply etched by intra-arm dust and appeared similar to a photograph of the galaxy.  One thick arm is attached to the core on the west or southwest side.  It curls counterclockwise on the north side towards the east (fairly flat curvature) and includes a slightly bright patch on the northeast portion [1.6' from center].  This arm continues and bends south, passing just inside a mag 14.5 star [2.5' E of center], and then quickly fading out to the south of this star.  The second prominent arm is attached to the core on its northeast side.  It curls counterclockwise to the east on the south and contains a brighter knotty section (numerous HII regions are embedded) nearly 1' in length that's just inside a mag 12 star 2.2' SW of center.  This arm turns abruptly to the north as it curls around the west side and ends on the northwest side of the halo.


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 215x, this beautiful, asymmetric face-on spiral extended ~7'x4.5' and was sharply concentrated with a very bright 40" core.  The spiral structure is unusual with a very long, relatively thick arm that curves from west to east on the north side of the core.  This arm then bends south on the east side and contains a very faint 20" HII knot situated northeast of the core [1.6' from center] and symmetrically placed opposite a mag 12 star in the outer halo on the southwest side.  This HII region is identified in NED as NGC 2997:[MM 81] 306, from the 1981 paper "Morphology and Kinematics of the Ionized Gas in NGC 2997" by Milliard and Marcelin in A&A, 95, 59.  A mag 14.5 star is near the end of this arm and due east of the core.  To the west of the end of this arm the light level noticeably dips (this is a gap between the arms) as well as on the southeast side of the halo, giving an asymmetric appearance.


A second fainter outer arm running roughly SW to NE also wraps around the galaxy on the west and north side but at further distance from the core.  This outer arm nearly reaches a mag 12 star on the southwest side (the one opposite the knot mentioned above) and then can be followed with more difficulty to the east where it attaches on the south side of the core.


13.1" (1/18/85): fairly bright, very large, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, 4.5'x3.0', sharply concentrated with a bright core, no nucleus.  A mag 13 star is at the SW edge of the halo 2.0' from center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2997 = H V-50 = h3188 on 4 Mar 1793 (sweep 1033) and recorded "vF, vS, lbM, lE about 8' long and 5 or 6' broad, a little from sp to nf about 10 or 15°."  This galaxy is the 4th most southerly object he discovered.


James Dunlop observed the galaxy on 7 May 1826 and recorded D 622 as "a faint elliptical nebula, 2.5' long and 1.5' broad, with a small star involved in the western margin.  His position is 15' too far NE, but the star involved on the southwest side seems to confirm the equivalence.


John Herschel made two detailed observations (h3188): on 28 Jan 1835 he logged "pB, vL, R, very suddenly a little brighter in the middle, to a pretty distinct round nucleus 4" in diameter. Diameter of nebula = 15 sec of time. The nebulous atmosphere extremely dilute. A very remarkable object."  On a later sweep he recorded "F, vL, first very gradually then very suddenly much brighter in the middle, to a nucleus (exactly like Halley's comet) as now (Feb. 16, 1836) seen in the equatorial; round; diam. in RA = 24 seconds. Has a 11th mag star S.p. just at the edge."
