17.5" (7/10/99): fairly faint, fairly small, round, 0.8' diameter, gradually increases to a small bright core and stellar nucleus at moments with concentration.  The galaxy is bracketed by two mag 13-14 stars 2.8' WSW and 2.2' ENE.


Lewis Swift found IC 1005 = Sw. VII-44 on 7 Jun 1888 and reported "F; S; R; BM."  There is nothing at his position but ~1.0 min of RA east is NGC 5607 and his description is appropriate.  This galaxy was discovered by William Herschel in 1785.  So, IC 1005 = NGC 5607.  Most sources identify this galaxy was NGC 5607 only and ignore the IC designation.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1013 = J. 1-291, along with IC 1017, on 16 Jun 1892.  His published offsets match CGCG 133-060, though Dreyer made a 1 degree error in north polar distance in the IC 1.  Javelle caught the errorn and noted it at the end of his third catalogue (Erratum au Premier Catalogue).  Dreyer included the correction in the IC 2 Notes.  Wolfgang Steinicke misidentified LEDA 214272 as IC 1013 and this error was repeated by Corwin and loaded into NED.  MCG, CGCG, PGC and HyperLEDA fail to identify CGCG 133-060 as IC 1013, probably due to the original IC error.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1027 = Sw. VII-45 on 23 Jul 1887 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R; another or a few F st. nr."  His position was just off the south side of UGC 9331 so the identification is certain. In 1900, Howe reported "Swift suspected 'another near'.

Lewis Swift found IC 1028 = Sw. VIII-81 on 1 Sep 1888 and reported "pB; S; R; F * close nf."  There is nothing at his position, but all modern catalogues identify IC 1028 = UGC 9368 (first given in the CGCG).  This galaxy is situated 15' SE of Swift's position.  But in August 2017, I noticed that IC 895 likely had 10 minute error in RA, so that IC 895 = NGC 5273, and Harold Corwin followed this lead and found IC 1028 (as well as IC 1045), also discovered on 1 Sep 1888, shared the same 10 minute error in RA.  The corrected position lands on the north edge of NGC 5739, and this galaxy has a 14th magnitude star off the northeast edge, matching the description.

This is an unusual situation with a brighter IC galaxy (discovered by William Herschel) in the field of a fainter NGC galaxy (discovered by John Herschel).


William Herschel discovered IC 1029 = H II-696 = Big. 185 on 15 May 1787 (sweep 736) and recorded "pB, S, E."  His position matches UGC 9361.  This galaxy is the brighter of a pair of edge-ons with fainter UGC 9347 9.6' NW.  When JH observed the field, he picked up UGC 9347, measured the position accurately (mentioning the star at the edge), but assumed it was his father's II-696.  JH used his position for h1838 in the GC and Dreyer followed in the NGC (NGC 5673 = h1838, but not H II-696).


When Bigourdan observed the pair of galaxies on 14 Jun 1887, he assumed UGC 9361 was new, measured an accurate position, and Dreyer catalogued Big. 185 as IC 1029.  This is an unusual situation where an IC object was discovered earlier by WH!  Note:  Malcolm Thomson argues in his IC identification notes that NGC 5673 = IC 1029.  See NGC 5673 for more.

Lewis Swift found IC 1056 = Sw. VII-50 on 4 Jul 1888 and reported, "eeF, L, R; forms an arc of a small circle with 2 sts; 3 pB sts nr sf in form of arc of a large circle."  His position was just off the west edge of this galaxy.  Swift first discovered this galaxy on 8 Apr 1888, but his description for IC 1057 differed and the position was 3' off, so he assumed they were different.  But IC 1056 = IC 1057.  The higher number should be the primary based on historical precedence.

R.J. Mitchell discovered IC 1066 = J. 1-324, along with IC 1067, on 16 May 1855 using LdR's 72".  He assumed he was observing the double system NGC 5765, but his description and sketch clearly refers to the IC pair.  He recorded "2 neb with 3 B st near, both F, bM.  The north one has a double star close sp, and is E np sf; the s one is perhaps also slightly E sp nf."  A diagram in the 1880 publication is a perfect match with IC 1066 and IC 1067 (close northeast of a double star).  The pair of galaxies was found again on 3 May 1856 while searching for NGC 5775!  Dreyer realized that Mitchell's pair was different than NGC 5775, but without a position he wasn't able to include it in the NGC.


Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again on 28 May 1891, measured an accurate position, and it was catalogued as IC 1066.  Javelle is credited in the IC, as the connection with the Birr Castle sketch was never made.

On 29 Jun 2000 I also viewed UGC 9710 in my 17.5" and recorded, "fainter of a very close pair with IC 1087 [33" between centers].  Glimpsed with averted vision only as a very small, elongated glow, ~20"x10" E-W.  It was difficult to hold IC 1087 and UGC 9710 simultaneously.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1100 = Sw. IX-45 on 22 Jun 1889 and logged "vF; pS; lE; bet 2 stars."  His position is 1.2' NW of UGC 9729.  This galaxy was probably discovered by William Herschel on 26 Apr 1789 (sweep 930) and noted H II-818 as "pF, cL, R, vgbM."  CH's reduced position is 52 sec of RA east and 2' south of UGC 9729.  Dreyer notes in the 1912 "Scientific Papers", that the listed RA in GC and NGC was 2 tmin too large (the actual error is ~ 2 min 45 sec).  Because of this error, Bigourdan and d'Arrest were unable to locate NGC 5881 and Swift assumed his rediscovery was new, though Dreyer noted in his "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that "II-818 is probably = IC 1100."


UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 all label this galaxy as IC 1100 (because of the unambiguous position) instead of NGC 5881.  I wrote up this case in RNGC Corrections #6 and it is discussed in Corwin's notes.

18" (6/30/11): this supergiant cD galaxy is the central galaxy in AGC 2029 (z = .078 at 1.0 billion light years!).  At 280x, it appeared very faint, very small, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~15"x10".  Visible continuously with averted vision.  The galaxy is centered within a 9-member circlet of 12th- to 14th-magnitude stars and squeezed between a mag 14.7 star 27" E and a mag 15-15.5 star 47" WNW (just slightly south of a line connecting these stars).  No other members of the cluster were seen.  I also viewed IC 1101 at a similar magnification in a 24" f/3.3 and logged it as "faint, very small, oval 3:2 N-S, ~20"x14".  Could just hold steadily with direct vision."


Wikipedia states this galaxy is the largest known in the universe, from 5-6 million light years.  A 1991 paper by Uson, Boughn, & Kuhn (ApJ, 369, 46) gives a slightly smaller, though still extremely large diameter of 4 million light years.


Edward Swift, the son of Lewis Swift, discovered IC 1101 = Sw. IX-47 on 19 Jun 1890 at the age of 19.  Lewis noted that he and Edward disagreed on the description after the telescope was moved, and as a result no description is given in Swift's 9th discovery list.  In his survey of NGC/IC objects around 1900, Herbert Howe found it to be "extremely faint and very small.  A star of mag 13 follows 1.5 seconds...and another precedes 2 seconds, a little north."  UGC does not label their entry (UGC 9752) as IC 1101.


This is a super-giant cD in the center of AGC 2029 at a distance of 1.07 billion light years (slightly larger redshift than AGC 2065!).  IC 1101 is certainly one of the most distant galaxies discovered visually (and possibly the most distant)!

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 1122 = B. 192 on 4 Jun 1889 and recorded "mag 13.5; 30"-40" diameter, eF stellar nucleus."  Dreyer also credited Barnard with the discovery based on his announcement of a new nebula found on 15 May 1890 while searching for the asteroid Eucharis. But Barnard's observation referred to NGC 5931 instead.  HyperLeda misidentifies IC 1122 as NGC 5931, but IC 1122 = LEDA 1326415.  Corwin and Thomson concur that IC 1122 is not equal to NGC 5931.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1124 = Sw. VIII-88 on 28 May 1889 and reported "eeF; vS; vE; 2 pB st. in field n."  His RA is 30 seconds too large but the description fits.  Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again and recorded J. 1367 as "pB, elongated in p.a. 250°, 30" to 40" length, mag 12-13 stellar nucleus." with an accurate position.  Dreyer realized that Javelle's object was the same as IC 1124 and noted this in the IC Notes/Corrections appendix, along with Javelle's accurate position.


Swift VIII,#88.  15hr 28m 21s +23° 49'.1

Confirmed galaxy: This is not an error in the context normally found and I enter it only for the historical significance.

Javelle made an observation some 14 years after Swift and noted the presence of a nebula, (he numbered as J.1367), which he measured from the 7.3Mv star DM+24°2874 resulting in coordinates of 15hr 27m 49s +23° 48'.2 which are at quite some variance with those given by Swift as to RA.  However, when this object is examined on the Palomar print there can be no doubt that despite the very inaccurate Swift coordinates this is definitely Swift's object #88 as can be established by reference to his description in which he stated "eeF; vS; vE; 2 pB st. in field n," and the south following of these 2 stars is Javelle's DM+24°2874.


Dreyer obviously concluded that the Javelle observation was a duplicate as he not only equated the two observations (Notes and Corrections to the Index Catalogue 1888-1894.  NGC/IC page 377.), but he also has no reference to any identity for J.1367 in his IC II, however, he did employ Swift's coordinates which are in considerable error, fortunately the modern catalogues do not reflect this, rather their coordinates are in keeping with those given by Javelle.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1125 = J. 2-789 on 10 Jun 1893.  His position is on the northwest side of UGC 9888 and the identification is certain.


Harold Corwin suggests that IC 1128 (discovered by Lewis Swift on 28 May 1889) is probably IC 1125 with a 5 minute error in RA and a 5 arcmin error in declination.   The CGCG identifies CGCG 022-018 = UGC 9939 as IC 1128.  This galaxy is much closer to Swift's position (similar RA, but 12' to the north).  But this galaxy has a companion (CGCG 022-017) that Corwin feels that Swift would have also picked up.  Most modern sources (including HyperLeda) follow CGCG.

Édouard Stephan independently found the galaxy on 27 Jun 1876, measured an accurate position in list VII-2 (later NGC 6020), and was credited by Dreyer with the discovery.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1149 = Sw. 10A-8 = Sw. XI-182 on 16 Jun 1892 and reported, "eeF, pS, R, in centre of rhombus of 4 stars, v diff."  His position is close west of UGC 10108, which is surrounded by several stars, although a trapezoid of 4 stars is a better description.  This galaxy is Swift's final catalogued discovery made in Rochester before moving to Lowe Observatory on Echo Mountain in Southern California.  His first discoveries there were in 1895.  Interestingly, that year he discovered a comet, while searching for "the last nebula discovered at the Warner Observatory...just prior to the dismantling of that institution, had never been catalogued or published, so on the morning of August 21st, the nebula being near the meridian, it occurred to me to look it up and secure, perhaps, a more accurate position...…I saw to my astonishment a beautiful comet instead of the expected nebula."   The comet's position that night was close to UGC 313, but I have no other evidence that was Swift's target.


Swift reobserved IC 1149 again on 16 Sep 1896 from Echo Mountain and reported it in his 11th discovery list with a slightly modified position (25 seconds of RA too small) and description ("in center of trapezium"), probably to make sure Dreyer didn't miss these discoveries.  Howe measured an accurate position in 1900 and suggested Swift's two entries were identical.  He described the surrounding stars as a rhomboid [trapezoid] and measured the separations and position angles.  All 5 objects Swift recorded as "new" that night were reobservations of objects he found in 1892, when he only reported 8 new objects in a short list between his formal 10th and 11th lists.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1158 = Sw. X-33 on 7 July 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  While searching for Wolf's comet of 1884 he found a nebula described in his logbook as "vF, R, 1' dia, vgbM, an 8m star 22' exactly following."  His rough position (no offsets) and the description clearly applies to this galaxy.   Barnard found it again less than a month later (4 Aug), looking for d'Arrest's Comet!   Lewis Swift made an independent discovery on 17 July and reported the discovery in his 10th list. Barnard never published the discovery or informed Dreyer, so Swift is credited with the discovery in the IC.

Although this galaxy lies between 2 stars, his comment can be made to apply to most galaxies.  Corwin states that "Swift's position is not very good, and the fact that he does not mention either object in his description of the other, casts some doubt on the identification."

48" (5/15/12): this number is generally taken as the fainter, southwest component of the interacting and connected pair NGC 6050 in AGC 2151.  It appeared as a faint, diffuse glow attached to the southwest side of the brighter component, but was not individually resolved at 375x.  There was a very weak central brightening and a very faint nucleus.


Lewis Swift found IC 1179 = Sw. VII-71 on 3 Jun 1888 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R.  11th of 12."  His position falls very close to the merged double system NGC 6050, discovered by Swift on 27 Jun 1886, and catalogued as Sw. IV-26.  PGC, SIMBAD and HyperLeda assign IC 1179 to the much fainter southwest component (NGC 6050B), but Corwin, Malcolm Thomson and I doubt that Swift could have resolved the pair.  Additionally Swift described NGC 6050A as "eeeF" (at his limit) but NGC 6050B is much fainter and furthermore he makes no mention of the nebula being double!  So, almost certainly IC 1179 is a duplicate observation of NGC 6050.  In the IC, Dreyer questioned if IC 1179 was a duplicate of NGC 6054 (it's not) and this is repeated in several sources such as Carlson.

24" (6/21/17): at 375x; faint, very small, round, 12" diameter [core of the galaxy only].  Fainter component of an interacting pair (Arp 172) with brighter IC 1178 30" NNW.


17.5" (5/13/88): extremely faint and small, possibly elongated.  Forms a very close pair 20" SE of IC 1178 in AGC 2151.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1181 = Sw. VII-72, along with IC 1178, on 3 Jun 1888 and noted "eeeF; S; R.  12th of 12."  His position is a good match with PGC 57063, the southeast component of douby system Arp 172.  But Harold Corwin warns for IC 1178, "... the fact that he does not mention either object in his description of the other, casts some doubt on the identification."  Gerard de Vaucouleurs called this galaxy IC 1181B in the "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies" (RC1).

48" (5/5/16): at 488x; moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated ~E-W, contains a bright core that increases to the center.  A mag 14 star is 1.3' W and a mag 17.8 star was occasionally visible [34"] east.


The brightest knot or condensation (likely a tidal dwarf galaxy) in the tidal tail was faintly visible 1.2' due east of IC 1182.  It was generally visible as a very faint, small glow, slightly elongated E-W, ~10"x7".  NED identifies this galaxy as IC 1182:[S72] d from the 1972 paper by Alan Stockton titled "Blue Condensations Associated with Elliptical and S0 Galaxies".  This "knot" formed the western vertex of an obtuse isosceles triangle with a mag 17 star 40" NE and a mag 15 star 40" SE.  The portion of the tidal tail extending directly out of IC 1182 (past the mag 17.8 star) was not seen.


48" (5/15/12): fairly faint to moderately bright, small, irregularly round, ~20" diameter, brighter nucleus.  Located 1.4' E of a mag 14.3 star.  Similar NGC 6054 lies 2.0' S.   The jet extending out of the east side of the galaxy and the blue knots 1.2' E were not noticed (though not looked for).


17.5" (5/13/88): very faint, very small, slightly elongated.  Situated between two mag 14.5 stars 1.4' W of center and a mag 15 star following.  Easier than IC 1183 2.1' SSE and NGC 6054 2.5' SW in AGC 2151.  IC 1185 lies 5.4' SSE.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1182 = J. 1-372 on 11 Aug 1892.  According to Harold Corwin in his Abell 2151 article, IC 1184 is a double or triple star 1.6' SE.  The UGC questions if IC 1182 = IC 1184, which is does not.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 1183 = Big. 203 = J. 372a on 1 Jun 1888.  Stephane Javelle picked it up again on 11 Aug 1892, as well as IC 1182.  But the original discovery was made by Lewis Swift on 27 Jun 1886, along with several other members of the Hercules Galaxy Cluster.  His description for Sw. IV-27 (later NGC 6054) reads "eeeF; pS; lE; f * v nr sp; 9th of 10."   His position is 13 seconds west of CGCG 108-128 = PGC 57073 (similar offset as NGC 6043, 6045, 6047, 6050) and his comment "faint star very near south-preceding" applies (the star is 1' southwest).  So, NGC 6054 = IC 1183.  Due to Swift's poor position MCG, PGC and RNGC misidentify CGCG 108-121 as NGC 6054 and the galaxy described here is called IC 1183.  See NGC 6054 for more.

24" (7/9/13): at 282x this AGC 2151 member appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, small, round, 20" diameter, gradually increases to the center.  Brightest in a small trio with IC 1192 1.7' NW and IC 1194A = PGC 84742 1.3' N.  Also nearby is IC 1193 3.3' SSW.


IC 1194A is located at Javelle's position for IC 1194, not the brighter galaxy 80" S (described above) that is generally assumed to be IC 1194.  It's possible Javelle assumed the brighter galaxy was a star, though it was clearly nonstellar in my scope at 282x.  IC 1194A appeared faint to fairly faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1194 = J. 1-377, along with IC 1192 and 1193, on 13 Aug 1892.  His position is a good match with the fainter lenticular 1.4' NE of IC 1192, which is commonly identified as IC 1194A = PGC 84742.  His position is also 1' north of the brighter elliptical (CGCG 108-152 = PGC 57172), which is described in my notes. CGCG 108-152 is identified as IC 1194 in most modern sources.  Perhaps Javelle made a 1' error in measuring the offset from his comparison star?  Interestingly, his offset is 1' too far north for nearby IC 1193 adding some support to this suggestion.


Corwin comments that "Perhaps he mistook the brighter object as a star, though it should have been clearly nebulous in the Nice 28-inch."  Malcolm Thomson and Corwin both identify IC 1194 = PGC 84742 based on the positional match, though the data here is for CGCG 108-152 as I'm not convinced.

24" (7/18/17): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 0.5'x0.4'.  Contains a stellar nucleus surrounded by the core of the galaxy.  An extremely low surface brightness outer halo was suspected.  A mag 10.5 star is 4' NE.  Located 12' SSE of mag 7.6 13 Herculi and 14' SW of mag 7.3 15 Herculi.


IC 1206 forms a close pair (similar redshifts) with CGCG 079-086 just 1.3' SSW of center.  The companion was very faint, small, round, low surface brightness, 12"-15" diameter.  A mag 16 star is close off its west edge [20" from center].


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1206 = Sw. VII-81 = Big. 208 on 3 Jun 1888 and reported "eF; S; R."  His position is just off the northwest edge of UGC 10293, so the identification is certain although he missed the close companion.  Bigourdan found it again on 28 Jun 1890 while searching for a comet discovered by d'Arrest.  He noted it was probably equivalent to Sw. VII-81 in his Comtes Rendus publication.  Dreyer credited both in the IC 1.

In 2016 Yann Pothier suggested to Harold Corwin that Arp 312 = PGC 59071/2 is Swift's IC 1232.  The RA is essentially matches, though the declination is off by +38'.  But there is a bright star near SE with a wide companion, matching Swift's description.  This is probably the best candidate, though not certain due to the error in declination.  Steinicke classifies the number as nonexistent.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1243 = Sw. IX-72 on 15 May 1890 and reported "pF; pS; vE; r."  There is nothing at his position but Howe examined the field on two nights in 1898 and found "five 12-14 mag. stars in a line, at an angle of 0 degrees [N-S], the length of the line being 45".  A star of mag. 14 immediately precedes the northern end of the row."  This asterism is 3' SW of Swift's position.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1250 = Sw. IX-77 on 23 Jun 1890 and reported "pF; S; cE."  His position is within 30" of LEDA 2565010, though I have concerns about this identification as his description doesn't seem appropriate. LEDA 2565010 is quite faint (V ~15), so I would expect Swift to have called it “eeF” or “eeeF”, instead of “pF”. Also visually only the 12" core was seen, yet his description says “cE".  The same night he discovered IC 1237, which he called “eF”. Yet IC 1237 appeared much brighter visually (at least a magnitude) than IC 1250.  But I don’t see another good candidate for the identification of IC 1250, unless his observation refers to NGC 6338, which is roughly a minute of RA east. Harold Corwin agrees with my brightness and elongation discrepancies and is placing colons (uncertainty) on the position in his IC table.

Rudolph Spitaler discovered IC 1257 on 7 July 1890 while searching for Barnard's Comet C/1888 RI using the 27" refractor at Wien University Observatory in Austria.  His micrometric position is accurate.  Barnard independently discovered it the next night while searching for his comet with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  In fact, Barnard initially mistook it for the comet!


Harlow Shapley listed IC 1257 as an open cluster (1930) and Sven Cederblad as a nebula (1946).  Brian Skiff reports in 9/96: Barry Madore to take a handful of short exposures of it at the Palomar 200", and has run through a first-cut data reduction.  The color-magnitude diagram shows that it is unquestionably a globular cluster, which is moderately heavily reddened:  it has the telltale marks of a metal-poor halo cluster, which are (a) a blue horizontal-branch population and (b) a steep red-giant branch.  See Harris et al. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....113..688H for the discovery announcement.

Dreyer catalogued the second observation as IC 1281, but queried "? = 1279".  Howe took a look at the field with the 20" refractor at Denver in 1899 and reported "I see only one nebula in the vicinity and call it 'vF, pS."


But Swift's second position happens to fall close to CGCG 200-010 = PGC 61527, a close pair of extremely small and faint galaxies, and Zwicky and Herzog identified this pair as IC 1279 in the CGCG (Volume III).

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1284 on a photographic plate taken with the 6" Willard lends on 31 May 1892.  He noted "an unknown nebulous star [BD -19° 4953].  It is shown on the photograph to be nearly symmetrically surrounded with a faint diffused nebulosity about 15' in diameter.  Perhaps this nebulosity is a little denser and more extensive following.  Visually with the 12 inch, I cannot be certain of seeing the nebulosity on account of the brightness of the central star." He later described nearby IC 1283 in AN 3111.  Barnard's position matches the mag 7.6 star involved.

24" (8/12/18): at 375x; IC 1285 is an asterism of 4 stars within 30".  On the NW side are the brighter two; a 10" pair of mag 14.1 and 14.8.  Close east are two mag 15.5/15.7 stars are 18".  The faintest star (SE end) was difficult in fairly poor transparency due to wildfire smoke.  Located 6.6' NW of NGC 6602.


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 1285 = B. 224 on 8 Aug 1888 and logged a mag 13.3 star accompanied by a few additional fainter stars that perhaps might have some traces of nebulosity.  There is no nebulosity.  Just a small group of 4 stars.

18" (8/12/07): this was a difficult observation to confirm as this large, very faint reflection nebula is illuminated by mag 5.7 HD 170740 (unequal double ∑2325 = 5.9/9.2 at 12") and the bright star naturally has some surrounding scattered light.  Adding a wide bandpass Deep Sky filter the glow definitely brightened and increased in size.  The contrast improvement was easy to see by blinking with the filter.  It was difficult to estimate a size as the haze faded into the background, but appeared ~15'-20' in size.  Open cluster NGC 6649 lies 38' NE.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1287 on a plate taken with the 12" Willard lens on 29 Jun 1892.  He noted (AN 3111) "the 5.5 mag star BD -10° 4713 is shown to be nebulous.  The star is surrounded by a large diffused nebulosity, somewhat extended in a direction nf and sp.  A telescopic examination [probably with the 12" refractor] with a very low power confirms the photograph."  Base on photographs at the Helwan observatory in Egypt in 1919-20, it was described as "a very large patch of faint, diffuse nebulosity around Boss 4687 extending chiefly to the south of it.

The glow elongates further to the NW of the core [this is the central bar].  An extremely small HII knot, ~5" diameter, occasionally popped in the same position near the NW end of the "bar" [18" NW of center].  There was a hint of an arm curling further northward towards a mag 13.5 star [0.8' NNE of center].  A mag 13 star is 1' WNW and two mag 11.5 stars further NW are collinear with the galaxy.


LEDA 214690 was glimpsed 3.7' NE.  At 375x it appeared extremely faint (B ~16.7), very small, round, 12" diameter.  It only occasionally popped with averted vision but verified as the position was consistent.

Appears to have a very faint quasi-stellar nucleus, along with a faint superimposed star very close southeast.  A mag 13.5 star is less than 1' N of center.  An HII region in the northwest spiral arm was not seen, though the transparency was fairly poor.  Two mag 11-11.5 star lie 2.4' and 3.4' NNW (collinear with the galaxy) and a mag 9.8 star is 4.2' SW.  Situated in a busy star field.

24" (8/12/15): At 220x + UHC filter, the rim was clearly brighter, particularly along the south side.  But the west side of the planetary was weaker with a darker indentation, creating a "C" appearance, open to the west. A very faint, fairly thin outer shell was visible with careful viewing.  This envelope was roughly the thickness of the brighter rim.  Increasing to 375x and removing the filter, I counted 8 or 9 superimposed stars including several around or just off the edge. The stellar planetary K 4-8 lies just 4.7' NW in the same high power field and NGC 6712 is 24' WNW in the same low power field.


K4-8 was easily visible unfiltered as a mag 14.5 "star", the middle of 5 stars in a shallow 51" arc, concave to the northwest. Excellent contrast gain adding a UHC filter at 220x, so it was very easy to identify.


33" (9/16/07): at 200x appeared weakly annular with a slightly darker hole in the center and slightly brighter rim except on the west edge where there was an indentation or darker notch taking a small bite out of the rim.


18" (7/22/06): at 220x and UHC filter this fairly bright, large planetary was crisp-edged, slightly elongated ~E-W, ~1.5x1.3' in size.  The rim appeared slightly brighter, particularly along the south side giving a weak impression of annularity.  Several stars bracket the planetary and four or five mag 14-15.5 stars appear within the disc at 325x without a filter.  I viewed this object along with NGC 6712 and the stellar planetary K 4-8 in the same low power field of view!


17.5" (6/30/00): fairly bright at 220x using a UHC filter as a roundish disc, ~1.6'x1.4'.  The surface brightness is irregular and it appears slightly brighter along the southwest and northwest portion of the rim.  The unfiltered view at 280x also reveals a mottled appearance with a mag 13.5-14 star situated right at the west edge and a mag 14.5 star in the interior (a bit offset from center).  A couple of extremely faint stars are at the following edge. Located 24' ESE of NGC 6712.

Truman Safford discovered IC 1295 = Sf 82 on 28 Aug 1867 with the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at Dearborn Observatory in Chicago and recorded "pB, pL, gbM."  Heber Curtis first recognized it as a planetary nebula in 1919.  Burnham's Celestial Handbook and the Sky Atlas 2000.0 mislabel this planetary as IC 1298.


In 1919, Heber Curtis reported it was undoubtedly a planetary nebula based on a Crossley photograph and described it as "Exceedingly faint; a faint, hazy ring about 2' x 1.5' in p. a. 90°±. The central portions are relatively vacant, and it is fainter along and at the ends of the major axis. There are three faint stars at the center, of which one is probably the central star."

At 488x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, 40" diameter with a round, very small bright nucleus.  Surprisingly, two faint, spiral arms were just visible extending from the nucleus!  A brighter arm is attached at the south side and winds counterclockwise towards the southwest.  It was often visible with averted vision.  The fainter arm on the north side curving northeast required more effort and was only occasionally visible but confirmed.  A mag 13.8 star is close preceding (26" W of center).

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1296 visually on 2 Oct 1893 with the Lick 36-inch refractor.  His description in AN 3200 reads "this nebula is about 1/2' diameter.  Not round.  A little brighter in the middle.  About 14th magnitude." His position matches this faint spiral, located just 4' NW of M57.


In a paper written by James Keeler in 1899 ("The Ring Nebula in Lyra"), he noted "Barnards small nebula.—The negative obtained with two hours’ exposure shows that the small nebula discovered by Professor Barnard with the 36-inch refractor in 1893 is a left- handed, two-branched spiral. The extreme diameter on the photograph is about 30."

Howe contacted Swift, who responded with a corrected declination of IC 1301 placing it 35' further north.  This places IC 1301 7' N of UGC 11438 = CGCG 256-018, which CGCG, RC3 and Malcolm Thomson identify as IC 1301.  But this galaxy does not match Swift's description of the surrounding stars.  Harold Corwin notes that 15' N of the corrected position is IC 4867, found visually by Burnham on 21 Jun 1901 while measuring O∑ 182, and this galaxy matches Swift's description, so is a much more likely candidate.

At ~30", this HII knot is slightly larger than Hubble V and more uniform in surface brightness but the brighter portions of Hubble V have a higher surface brightness.  This is the easternmost of four HII knots along the northern side of Barnard's Galaxy.


18" (7/12/10): easily visible unfiltered at 225x and stands out fairly well at 285x as a 25" knot (irregularly round). Situated 1.7' NW of a mag 12/14 double star at ~8" separation.  This is the slightly fainter of a similar pair of HII knots at the north end of NGC 6822 with Hubble V just 3' W.


17.5" (9/1/02): the eastern of two HII regions at the north end of Barnard's galaxy. Easily visible with averted vision at 220x without a filter and there is mild contrast gain using an OIII filter at 140x.


17.5" (7/14/99): following of a pair of HII regions with Hubble V at the north end of NGC 6822 = Barnard's Galaxy. Visible with direct vision at 220x and 280x without a filter. There was a mild contrast gain using a UHC filter at these magnifications.


17.5" (8/21/98): easily visible at 220x without a filter as a 30" round knot along with Hubble V just 3.1' W. Because I had no problem viewing this HII region without filtration I didn't blink or use an OIII filter.

Francis Leavenworth discovered IC 1308 = LM(S) 791 on 18 Jun 1887 with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick observatory.  Leavenworth missed seeing the galaxy but picked up the two bright HII regions at the north end of the galaxy instead.  Apparently, NGC 6822 was assumed to be the HII region Hubble V close preceding IC 1308 (Leavenworth credited both objects to Barnard) as the IC description for 1308 reads "eF, eS, lE, gbM, 6822 p 12s" (which actually refers to Hubble V).  E.E. Barnard independently discovered the two HII regions on 7 Jul 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.


Although the IC position matches this HII region and Howe also reobserved it and noted the double star close SE, Paul Hodge didn't label it as IC 1308 in "The HII regions of NGC 6822", P.A.S.P. 100:917-934, Aug 1988 or in "A Catalogue of diffuse nebula and emission-line stars in NGC 6822", 94:444-452, June 1982.  But Hubble's seminal 1925 paper on NGC 6822 (http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/full/1925ApJ....62..409H), mentions nebula X is identical to IC 1308.

It didn't stand out well at this power due to the rich environment but the glow had a noticeably higher surface brightness than the unresolved Milky Way glow.  The view was improved at 220x; a faint sprinkling of stars are superimposed (8-10 with averted vision) and the 2' cluster has an irregular outline.  Appears similar to a partially resolved globular.  A nice mag 12/13 double star [9" separation] is off the NE end 1.5' from center.  The view holds up well at 410x and one or two additional faint stars were resolved.


Rev. Thomas Espin discovered IC 1310 on 19 Sep 1893 with his 17-inch reflector at his private observatory in England while sweeping for red stars.  He simply recorded "faint nebulosity"  Very close to his position is this faint cluster, which was independently catalogued as Berkeley 50.


Probably due to the IC description, Cederblad included IC 1310 in his list of bright nebulae as well as Beverly Lynds, although there is no nebulosity.

Rev. Thomas Espin discovered IC 1311 on 6 Oct 1893 with his 17-inch reflector at his private observatory in England while sweeping for red stars.  He recorded an "extremely faint nebula within a circle of bright stars."  His position (though mentioned as approximate in his discovery list) is fairly accurate.  The Lynga 5 position, though, is incorrect (repeated in Sky Catalogue 2000 and Skiff & Luginbuhl).

Rudolph Spitaler discovered IC 1317 = Sp 23 on 30 Sep 1891 with the 27-inch refractor in Vienna.  His position is accurate, though he called it a "planetary nebula = mag 12 star, size 1/4' or slightly less, easily visible."  Based on a Crossley plate taken Lick Observatory (1912), Charles Perrine also described a "faint planetary about 15" in diameter" (perhaps using Spitaler's comment).

IC 1318 = LBN 223 = LBN 234 = LBN 245 = LBN 251 = Ced 176 = Sh 2-108 = Gamma Cyg Nebula = Butterfly Nebula

20 22 14 +40 15 24; Cyg


18" (7/13/07): Both portions of the "Butterfly Nebula" were easily visible at 12.5x in my 80mm finder using an H-beta filter and were an amazing sight in my 18-inch at 73x using both H-beta and UHC filters as they stretched across the entire 67' field of field and separated by a wide dark lane (LDN 889).


IC 1318d (centered ~1° east of Gamma Cyg) passes through two 7th magnitude stars (HD 194789 and HD 194908) and is very prominent near these stars.  This swath of nebulosity courses mainly SW and NE from these stars.  To the west of the bright stars, the nebula is bifurcated into two forks by a dark lane.  To the north and NE of the stars, the nebulosity spreads out wider and is interspersed with darker regions.  Overall the surface brightness of this section is fairly high but varies quite a bit in intensity and is slightly brighter on the following side of the NE end where it contrasts with the wide dust lane that separates IC 1318e to the SE.


IC 1318e is situated roughly 35' SE of IC 1318d on the opposite side of dark nebula LDN 889.  This bright section passes through several wide double stars and gently curves as it sweeps from SW to NE.  The overall length is at least 35'x10' (not as wide as on photographs but nearly as long).  One or two darker spots or regions lie within the nebulosity although it appears as a single continuous piece without as much structure as IC 1318d.


IC 1318b is possibly the brightest piece of the IC 1318 complex and is located ~2° NW of Gamma Cyg (Sadr).  At 73x and either H-beta or UHC filter, it appeared very extended SW-NE or WSW-ENE, roughly 40'x8' and passes through a mag 8 star.  This section was easily visible at 12.5x in the 80mm finder using a H-beta filter.  The brightest portion is to the NE of the mag 8 star and a number of similar mag stars are involved with this portion.  Removing the filter, this section was still visible though the highest contrast was using a UHC filter.  To the SW of the star, this river of nebulosity takes a mild bend and flows more towards the south.  Another fainter section of nebulosity (not included in the size estimate) spreads out to the NNW of the mag 8 star.


12.5x80mm (7/13/07): viewed in 80mm finder using an H-beta filter.  The two roughly parallel brightest sections to the east of Gamma that form the "Butterfly Nebula" (IC 1318d and 1318e) were obvious as extremely large parallel strips oriented ~SW-NE and separated by a wide dark lane.


16x80 (8/23/84): extremely large complex of irregular emission nebulae surrounded Gamma Cygni (position given) with six sections visible at 16x using a UHC and H-beta filters.  Overfills the 4° finder field!  The most prominent section is an isolated patch NW of Gamma at the edge of the field (IC 1318b = Ced 176c = LBN 251 = DWB 82) and next are two parallel strips just east (IC 1318d = LBN 249) and SE of Gamma (IC 1318e = LBN 245) that have fairly sharp edges.  Observation from Mt Rose (above Lake Tahoe) using the finder.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1318 on a photographic plate taken with the Willard lens in 1892.  He simply mentioned "A photograph which I have made in 1892 with five hours of exposure was Chi Cygni, shows Gamma Cygni to be surrounded by numerous large patches and strips of nebulosity." (Astronomy and Astro-Physics, Vol XIII, No. 3, March 1894).

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1346 = J. 1-407, along with IC 1354, on 7 Aug 1891.  There is nothing at either of his positions but their relative positions point to IC 1346 = MCG -02-53-019 and IC 1354 = MCG -02-53-021.  Harold Corwin worked backwards and found that Javelle misidentified his offset star, which caused the poor positions.  He found the second galaxy again on 26 July 1892 and measured an accurate position.  As a result IC 1354 is better known as IC 1350.

The central two nuclei are separated by only 7" N-S, but were resolved cleanly at 976x.  The fainter southern nuclei was faint, very small, round, ~10" diameter, while the northern core was nearly moderately bright and ~15" diameter.   The outer nuclei were both 20" from the center; the western one (catalogued as LEDA 3938837) was moderately bright, fairly small, round, ~15" diameter and the eastern one very faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.

An extremely compact companion (IC 1365 NED02) is at the edge of the halo on the west side.  It appeared very faint, round, ~6" diameter.  The main glow forms an isosceles triangle with a mag 12 star 1.7' E and a mag 12.4 star 1.7' SSW.

At 610x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, fairly high surface brightness, 15"-18" diameter, sharp bright stellar nucleus.  A mag 16 star is just 10" E of center and a mag 14.5 star is 0.9' NE.  Located 3.5' W of a mag 10 star.


An extremely faint galaxy (V = 17.6) was seen 12" W of center of IC 1370.  In addition, LEDA 1219013 is a double system only 23" W of IC 1370.  Both components (V = 17.0/17.6) were barely resolved at 610x.  LEDA 1219124 is a brighter galaxy (V = 16.8) 0.9' WNW of IC 1370.  Finally, LEDA 1217822 (V = 15.8) is a thin low surface brightness edge-on 2.2' SSE of IC 1370.  IC 1365, a quadruple merging system, lies 30' NW.


24" (9/16/17): at 375x; faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.  At first I thought it had a faint stellar nucleus, but this a 16th mag star at the east edge. IC 1368 lies 15' W.


24" (8/12/15): at 375x; faint, very small, round, ~10"-12" in diameter.  Forms an extremely close "pair" with a mag 16 star [10" east of center], close to the edge of the small halo!


An extremely faint, stellar or nearly stellar object was occasionally glimpsed close to the west [by 24"].  This was probably LEDA 1219013, itself a double system, with a B magnitude close to 17.  IC 1370 is located 3.5' S of a mag 9.5 star and the same distance west of a mag 10.1 star, so it forms the southwest vertex of an isosceles right triangle with the two stars.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1370 = J. 1-422 on 5 Oct 1891 and recorded "vF, 2 F st inv".  At least one of these "stars" (as in my observation) is likely one of the components of this multiple system.  On the SDSS, there are a total of 5 galaxies, with at least 4 apparently interacting.

17.5" (8/22/98): the "Elephant's Trunk" is an unusual cometary globule (associated with star formation) on the west side of IC 1396, a huge but faint HII complex. The highest contrast was using a UHC filter at 100x.  A 15'x5' lane was evident oriented WSW-ENE, particularly by gently rocking the scope back and forth. The "tail" of the globule or elephant's "trunk" heads west and is weakly illuminated on the edges, particularly on the south side.  Near the "head" is a mag 9 star (HD 239710) and a pretty double star (∑2813 = 9.2/9.6 at 10") to the west is embedded in the lane.  With careful viewing the "trunk" shows variations in width and opacity.  The head is located ~18' W of the triple star ∑2816 (5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12"/20").


17.5" (8/12/96): This HII region is most prominent with a UHC filter at 100x surrounding the triple star (HD 206267 = ∑2816 = 5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12" and 20") at the center of a scattered cluster although nebulosity is not apparent throughout the field.  About 25' away is also a pretty double star whose components are aligned with the triple star.  The surrounding 1° field contains a scattered cluster of brighter stars which are fairly uniformly distributed.


In the 16x80 finder unfiltered, the entire cluster is clearly encased in a faint glow at least two degrees in diameter though the nebulosity seems to be more prominent along the curving lanes of the cluster.  The Daystar 300 filter gives a mild enhancement but dims the stars so the overall view is not as pleasing.  Mu Cephei (Herschel's Garnet Star) is at the northeast edge of the nebulosity, ~1.5° from the center.


18" (7/11/10): Barnard 161 is an easy 6' circular dark patch within IC 1396 (north of center) just 13' N of ∑2819 = 7.4/8.7 at 13" and 25' NE of the triple star ∑2816 = 5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12" and 20".  Stands out fairly well at 73x.  There are extensions to the north of this cometary dark nebula that I didn't see.


16x80 (9/29/84 and 8/26/89): using a UHC filter appears as a very large, irregular nebulous glow (about 2° diameter).  Very faint but definite when compared without filter.  Surrounds ∑2816 = 5.8/7.7 at 12" and a large, faint, scattered star group.  Visible without a filter as an extremely large, hazy region surrounding ∑2816 and fainter stars.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1396 on a photographic plate taken with the Willard lens in 1893.  He commented in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Clusters connected with the Milky Way" (Astr. & Astro-Phys. 13, 177-182 (1894)) that "A magnificent specimen of these [nebulous masses] I have found on one of my plates in Cepheus which was given an exposure of seven hours.  This a mixture of bright stars and nebulosity.  The diffused portion of this nebulosity conforms in its peculiarities with the general structure of the Milky Way, showing it be actually mixed up with the ground work of star.  The brightest star of this group is DM +56° 2617."

Truman Safford discovered IC 1427 = Sf. 52 on 14 Sep 1866 and reported "vF, vS, Neb M[iddle]."  His position is 15 seconds of RA too far west.  There are no other nearby galaxies so this identification is secure.

24" (10/3/13): at 225x using an NPB filter, IC 1454 (Abell 81) appeared fairly bright, round, 30" diameter, crisp-edged.  The planetary displayed a relatively large, brighter rim that was unevenly lit, and a small (~12"), slightly darker center.  Unfiltered the annularity was more difficult to confirm, though the rim appeared slightly brighter on the south side.  A pair of 14th magnitude stars are just off the NE side and a mag 13.4 star is 1' SE.  Situated 4.3' W of mag 7 HD 215867.


18" (10/13/07): easily swept up at 175x, located 4' W of mag 7.0 HD 215867.  Compared views unfiltered and with UHC, OIII and NPB filters.  Best seen using OIII, though NPB gave the most natural view with brighter stars. Two faint mag 14/15 stars are very near the NE edge (brighter star barely off edge) with a brighter mag 13 star 1' SE.  At 225x using the NPB filter, IC 1454 appeared round, ~25-30" in diameter with an impression of an irregular surface brightness.  The rim sometimes appeared slightly brighter with a weaker center giving a very subtle annularity.


18" (10/9/04): easily picked up at 73x just 4' WNW of a 7th magnitude star as a small, well-defined disc.  Visible unfiltered at 160x; a couple of mag 14/15 stars are barely off the NE edge of the planetary and a 13th magnitude star lies 1' SE.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  The disc was perfectly round, ~25" diameter with a very crisp edge.  The surface brightness appeared a bit irregular but could not verify annularity at this power.


17.5" (10/13/01): picked up at 100x without filter as a faint, small disc situated 4' WNW of a mag 7 star.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears as a round, 25" crisp-edged disc.  At 220x without filter a faint mag 14/15 pair is at the NE edge.  Very nice view using a UHC filter at 140x-220x; the PN was slightly elongated ~E-W but no other details are visible.

13.1" (8/11/85): at 88x and OIII filter, fairly faint, fairly small, round.  Located 4' W of a mag 7 star that detracts from viewing.  At 166x with a UHC filter; easy to view, moderately large.  Two very faint stars are involved near the NE edge.


William Denning discovered IC 1454 on 9 Aug 1891 with his 10-inch reflector (announced in Observatory, 15, 104).  He noted it was "rather a difficult object, except on a good night, though I picked it up with a power of only 40.  It is noteworthy as being situated in the midst of a region containing very few nebulae."  IC 1454 was found by Abell in 1955 on the POSS and listed as #67 of 73 new planetary nebulae.  Abell recognized the earlier IC designation but included it in his list as it wasn't previously recognized as a planetary.  In his second list (1966) IC 1454 was renumbered as Abell 81.

Spitaler found it again just two weeks later on 6 Oct with the 27-inch refractor at Vienna University Observatory.  Spitaler reported, "Faint, round nebula of 1/4' - 1/2' diameter, brighter middle, forming a right-angled triangle with two stars mag 11 with the nebula at the right angle. Between the nebula and the preceding star 11 there is a star 12 closer to the star than to the nebula. I do not see the nebula NGC 7403. It's curious that Coolidge did not notice my nova; or is NGC 7403 identical to the Nova?"  But Coolidge's object is probably a single star, like all his other reported discoveries.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1459 on 13 Dec 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  While searching for Brorsen's Comet (5D/Brorsen), he ran across IC 1459 and several other NGC galaxies.  A position computed the next night is just 40" south of center.  Barnard published the discovery in a short note titled "An unsuccessful search for Brorsen's Comet 1889-90" in Astronomische Nachrichten 125, 43 (1890).  He mentions on the night of December 13th, "several unrecorded nebulae found.  One of these, in wide field with [NGC] 7418 and 7421 but not in NGC, deserves special notice.  It was small, about 1/2' in diameter, cometary and rather brighter, with a 12m nucleus."  He added "Careful filar-micrometer observations were made of it and will be printed in a list of nebulae measured here", but apparently this never occurred.  Two nights later he discovered IC 5264 when he reobserved the field.


Lewis Swift independently discovered the galaxy on 10 Jun 1896 (other dates given in different publications) and described Sw. XI-220 (later IC 5265) as "B, cL, R, betw 2 stars p and f; nf of 2 [with IC 5264].  His position was 25 seconds of RA too large and 4' too far south, but the identification is certain.  He questioned if his object was identical to IC 1459 (in the first Lowe Observatory list in Astr. Journal).  It is.  Corwin notes that Dreyer questioned if IC 5265 might be identical to NGC 7418, but it's not.  Knox-Shaw included this galaxy in a list of new nebulae found at the Helwan Observatory and published in 1912.  He questioned if it was identical to IC 5295, but didn't make the connection with IC 1459.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1461 = Sw. IX-98 on 20 Oct 1889 and reported "eeeF; vS; R."  There is nothing at his position, but 10' north is CGCG 430-036 and this is probably Swift's object.  Howe found this galaxy again 10 years later while searching for IC 1461 and measured an accurate position (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1502 = Sw. X-56 on 15 Oct 1891 and recorded "vF; S; vF * close."  His position is accurate.


The UGC has two entries: The RA for UGC 12105 has a typo of 1 hour of RA too small, with the correct RA is listed under UGC 12706.  The dimensions and PA are slightly different, so it was measured twice on the POSS.  Also, this galaxiy lies in two different declination zones of the MCG (+12 and +13) and also in two different CGCG fields (344 and 359), so it has 6 entries in these 3 catalogues!

Sherburne Burnham discovered IC 1523 on 19 Aug 1889, while checking if mag 4.0 Omega Psc was double using the 36-inch Lick refractor.  His offset of 164" west is a good match with this faint galaxy.  E.E. Barnard found the galaxy again (or perhaps he also observed it with Burnham) at Lick, probably with the 36-inch, and reported it directly to Dreyer.  His position matches the bright star.

Truman Safford discovered IC 1524 = Sf 87 on 23 Sep 1867.  His published discovery list in 1887 is missing his description and there is nothing at his position.  But 20 seconds of RA west and 1.6' north is MCG -01-01-011 = PGC 73151, the brighter of a north-south pair of galaxies.  Lewis Swift independently found IC 1524 on 5 Nov 1891 and recorded Sw.

There is nothing near Swift's position, but Harold Corwin found that Swift made an error of 30 minutes of time (too small) in recording his RA.  Once corrected, his RA is just 9 seconds too small and the dec matches perfectly, as well as his description of the nearby stars.  So, IC 1524 = IC 1490.  MCG, PGC, HyperLeda, WikiSky, etc. misidentify MCG -01-01-012, the fainter southern galaxy,, as IC 1524.

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran): IC 1537 is the low surface brightness eastern portion of NGC 55.  The following notes only refer to this portion of the galaxy: Continuing further ESE (from the central section), the surface brightness drops significantly very quickly and a large, elongated dark wedge appears to take a bite out of the galaxy.  Just as the galaxy begins to brighten again towards the ESE end, there is another bright round knot and a second very small piece just detached to the ENE.  At the ESE tip the galaxy brightens a bit more and has an irregular, patchy appearance with a couple of brighter stars superimposed.


17.5" (11/1/86): the eastern portion appears tilted at a slight angle to the main western portion.


13.1" (11/5/83): the very faint eastern portion is near detached from the bright WNW section.


8" (9/25/81): very large, very elongated, brighter to the west, very faint eastern section.


Lewis Swift found IC 1537 = Sw. XI-2 on 23 Sep 1897 and reported "eeeF; vL; eE; close f NGC 55; f of 2 [with NGC 55]."  He included a long note at the end of his discovery list: "This with its associated companion is a remarkable nebula.  I am undecided as to whether it is all one, or consisting of two, the preceding half very very bright, very larg, exceedingly elongated as Sir John Herschel describes it, and the following half exceedingly exceedingly faint, very large, exceedingly elongated, partly overlapping the other.  If single it is curved, if double are inclined to each other.  I am included to think they are two distinct nebulae, one reason being that the brighter ends sharply, which would be improbably if the brighter merged into the fainter.  The brighter was discovered by Dunlop, but he could not have seen the fainter.  As Sir John Herschel does not mention with a sign as being a remarkable object, lends plausibility to the idea that it was not seen even by him."


But Dunlop's size estimate of 25' includes the faint eastern portion and John Herschel's sketch of NGC 55 clearly shows the fainter eastern section!  Corwin's position is centered on the brightest portion of the eastern half.

Many sources including MCG, ESO, PGC, NGC 2000.0, HyperLEDA and SIMBAD identify ESO 350-033 as IC 1554, in fact as far back as the 1921 Helwan list of observations.  ESO 350-033 is situated 14' SSE of Stewart's position, which would be an exceptionally large error by Stewart.  Furthermore, although ESO 350-033 is elongated, the position angle is 25° (SSW-NNE), whereas Stewart reported an orientation of NNW-SSE (about 30° off from ESO 350-033).


Wolfgang Steinicke lists the number as "not found" and Malcolm Thomson came to the same conclusion.

Herbert Howe followed up on Swift's observation and noted "..the discoverer says that a "wide D * close p point to it."

Although the IC identification is not certain due to a poor discovery position by Swift, MCG -02-02-059 is much more likely to be Swift's object.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1556 = Sw. XI-4 on 10 Sep 1895 and reported "eeeF; pS; R; ee diff[icult]".  There is nothing near his position and it was reported "Not shown" on plates taken at the Helwan Observatory in 1919-20.  HyperLeda doesn't assign IC 1556 to a galaxy and both Steinicke and Seligman lists the number as not found or lost.   But 12' due north is a pair of galaxies.  Assuming he picked up the much brighter galaxy, then IC 1556 = MCG -02-02-059 = PGC 2100.  NED identifies IC 1556 with fainter MCG -02-02-057.  See Corwin's notes for more on this number.

Herbert Howe discovered IC 1557 = Ho III-1 on 6 Nov 1899 with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.  While observing and measuring  NGC 161 (discovered by Swift), he mentions "I noticed another nebula 2' south of 161."  In his list of new nebula (MNRAS 60, 611, 1900), Howe adds "eF, vS" and "attended by a star of mag 14, a trifle south, and by another, which follows the nebula closely."  Although his position is accurate, the MCG, PGC, RNGC, HyperLeda and Roger Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 incorrectly equate NGC 161 with IC 1557. The original error was likely made in the MCG.

13.1" (10/20/84): appears as a "faint star" possibly nebulous at the south edge of NGC 169, forming a close contact system (Arp 282).


R.J. Mitchell discovered IC 1559 = Big. 245 = J. 3-819 on 18 Sep 1857 using LdR's 72" and described NGC 169 as "S; d. neb; the n one is E, sp/nf; bM."  IC 1559 is the fainter southern component.  It was confirmed a month later on 22 Oct 1857 and reobserved by Lawrence Parsons in 1866.  Mitchell assumed his observation of a double nebula referred to NGC 160, though, with the second object catalogued later as GC 80.  But comparing the description to the field, it's clear that Mitchell was referring to NGC 169 and its close companion to the south.


Herman Schultz observed the field on 5 Sep 1867 (9.6" refractor) and also suspected NGC 169 to be double ("is probably S globular, and seems sometimes to be divided into two separate objects.").  In the 1880 publication Dreyer notes that Mitchell mistook his object for h32 = NGC 160, but the "double nebula" should apply to h82 = NGC 169.


Because of all the confusion Dreyer dropped GC 80 from the GC Supplement and added GC 5107 [= NGC 162] to a faint star east-northeast of NGC 160 that Schultz and Lawrence Parsons noted as nebulous.  As a result IC 1559 did not receive a NGC number despite being observed twice by Mitchell, later by Lawrence Parsons and even suspected by Schultz.  It was discovered again independently by Bigourdan on 7 Oct 1885 and by Javelle on 20 Nov 1897 and included in the IC as 1559.  Dreyer credited "LdR", along with Bigourdan and Javelle, with the discovery.

IC 1611 is fairly bright, irregular shape, elongated SW to NE, ~1 diameter.  A couple of very faint stars were resolved at the edges, though this object appears to be primarily an emission nebula (DEM S 106).  A mag 12.5 star lies 1' NNE (blue supergiant RMC 16) and a mag 13 star is 1' ENE.  IC 1612 lies 2.4' SSE and Kron 22 4' SE.

The background glow of the SMC is relatively bright in this region so the cluster is set over a background glow that seems to extend more noticeably to the W and SW.

48" (10/26/16): I spent a few minutes identifying OB associations in the patchy northeast section section of IC 1613. At 375x I was able to pinpoint a half-dozen faint or fairly faint "knots", generally 12"-15" in diameter within a 1.5' region.  The identifications below are from Paul Hodge's 1978 study "The structure and content of IC 1613" and the Borissova et al. 2004 paper "The catalogue of OB associations in IC 1613".


[H78] 10 = [BKG04] G7, the brightest patch, is on the west edge and seen as moderately bright, small, 12" diameter.  A star or stellar object is involved.  Close northeast and southeast are [H78] 13 = [BKG2004] G11 and [H78] 14 = [BKG2004] G14, both easily seen as fairly faint glows, ~15" diameter.  [H78] 17 = [BKG2004] G25 is very faint knot 1' E of [H78] 13 and [H78] 15 = [BKG2004] G15 was visible 30" S of [H78] 14.  [H78] 11 = [BKG2004] G10 was also easily seen as a 12" knot 1.5' N of [H78] 10.


18" (9/15/07): faint, very large, irregular glow, roughly elongated 4:3 SW-NE, ~8'x6'.  A mag 10.5 star is just at the west edge of the glow. A very small knot (HII region?) or core is faintly visible just 2' E or ENE of the mag 10.5 star.  There appears to be a very faint detached piece to the northeast about 7' from the mag 10.5 star.  Located ~12' S of  mag 7.2 HD 6375.


13.1" (12/22/84): faint, large, extremely diffuse.  This Local Group member appears as an irregular hazy region with a large brighter section to the NE and a fainter section to the SW.  No visible core.  Several brighter stars are in the field includes a star at the SW edge.  Located 46' N of 26 Ceti.


Max Wolf discovered IC 1613 on a plate taken with the Bruce 16-inch telescope in September 1906.  Wolf's position (given in 1885 coordinates) is ~10' south and 1.5 minutes of time preceding the galaxy.  As he used BD stars to measure positions, it's very possible the coordinates for the "densest part" are for 1855.  If so, his position is near the center of IC 1613!


William Baade first showed it was extragalactic in 1935 and a year later Hubble included it as a Local Group member.  The distance is ~2.4 million light years.

Three fainter stars lie NW and NE with the galaxy nestled inside this group of stars.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1616 = Sw. XII-5 on 24 May 1897 (or 1898) and recorded "extremely faint, pS, close to 3 st like belt of Orion."  His position is 2.5' NW of ESO 412-004 and the three stars are off the south side.  Harold Corwin notes that although Swift listed 1897 as the year of the discovery in his 12th list, he includes 2 others found on 24 May 1898.  So assuming they were all found on the same night it is more likely this object was found in 1898.  If that's the case, this one of his last few discoveries.

IC 1633 is the brightest cD galaxy at the core of AGC 2877, a member of the Phoenix Supercluster.  Several nearby companions were easily seen in the field; a total of 17 galaxies were logged within 16' of IC 1633 using a 25" on 10/15/17 and the 30" on 10/18/17.  Still, I certainly could have viewed more if I had spent additional time.


James Dunlop discovered IC 1633 = D 437 = Sw. XI-13 on 5 Aug 1826 and recorded "an extremely faint small nebula; round, with a very minute bright point in the center."  Dunlop's position is 6.6' SW of ESO 243-046, but this is a typical error and there no other brighter nearby candidates.  Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy on 29 Sep 1897, assumed it was new, and logged Sw. XI-13 as "vF; S; R; no B* near; vF one following."  His declination was 2° too far north in his 4th Lowe list, but corrected in the large AN table.  Dreyer credited Swift and DeLisle Stewart (who measured the position on an Arequipa plate taken in 1899) with the discovery, but not Dunlop.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1667 = Sw. XI-16 on 6 Oct 1896 and reported "eF, pS, R, no * near, 8m * in field nf".  There is nothing near his position.  MCG suggests MCG -03-4-039 = IC 1667.  This galaxy is 1 min of time east and 3.5' north of Swift's position, though there is a mag 8.4 star 11' ENE that would have been in Swift's field.  So, despite the poor position (more common in his later years) and no mention of IC 93 = IC 1671, which he "discovered" twice and lies only 5' ESE, MCG -03-4-039 is a reasonable candidate.

At first glance I noticed a fairly high surface brightness knot ~20" in diameter but with careful viewing, faint extensions were seen oriented E-W, increasing the size to ~0.9'x0.3'.

24" (10/1/16): moderately bright and large, oval 3:2 NW-SE, ~45"x30",well concentrated with a small bright core.  A mag 14.3 star is 50" ENE.  There was an impression of brighter regions to the northwest and southeast of the core.  Perhaps these are portions of arms or an inner ring.  Forms a pair with CGCG 502-035 (often identified as IC 96) 5' SSW.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1672 = J. 3-857 on 6 Dec 1899.  His micrometric position matches UGC 872.  This galaxy was probably discovered earlier by Truman Safford on 1 Dec 1866 and reported as Sf. 69 (later IC 96) in the 1887 Dearborn Observatory discovery list.  Safford's position is poor and is equal distance from CGCG 502-035 and IC 1672.  See 96 for more.

IC 1695 is the brightest member of Shakhbazian 40, which corresponds with the central region of AGC 193.  Nine additional galaxies ranging from V = 15.0 to V = 17.0 were visible in the 488x field: Shkh 40-14, 40-23, 40-29, 40-39, 40-43, 40-44, 40-56, 40-57, UGC 967.


18" (12/3/05): I forgot about my observation of IC 1695 two months ago and assumed it was part of the NGC 524 group.  But with a redshift of z = .048 compared to .008, this galaxy lies six times further away in the heart of AGC 193 and Shk 40!  At 225x it appeared faint to fairly faint, small, irregular round, slightly brighter core.  The core or a stellar knot seemed offset to one side (double galaxy).  A mag 12 star is less than 1' NW.  This description is quite similar to the one two months back.


18" (10/8/05): The brightest member of AGC 193 and Shakhbazian 40 appeared faint, small, irregularly round.  Situated just 43" SE of a mag 13 star.  In moments of better seeing this galaxy appeared double with an extremely faint knot or extension to the northeast of the core of the main galaxy.  The next day I checked the DSS and this observation matches the image!  This distant cluster has a redshift of z = .048 which corresponds to a distance of over 700 million light years.  The only other member seen was UGC 967, located 7.5' NW.

E.E. Barnard found IC 1712 on 10 Dec 1888 while observing his comet discovery C/1888 RI with the comet nearly occulting the galaxy!  He wrote in his notebook, "The comet's nucleus passed some 30" N of the nucleus of the nebula.  The comet is probably 5 times as bright as the nebula and is a great many times larger."  The discovery was reported directly to Dreyer, who catalogued it again as IC 1712, though Barnard's position is nearly identical to NGC 584.  Barnard later added the comment “NGC 584” in his notebook, obviously after getting around to checking the NGC, so he was aware of the equivalence but perhaps never passed this information along to Dreyer.


Based on a photograph taken between 1914-16 at the Helwan Observatory in Egypt, IC 1712 was misidentified as LEDA 1028168 in the 1921 observatory bulletin.  This galaxy is located 7' WNW of NGC 578 and too faint to have been picked up by Barnard with the 12-inch.

There is nothing near his position (01 32 54 -13 30.0, for 2000) or even searching east or west several degrees.

13.1" (11/5/83): very faint, moderately large, diffuse, ill-defined, elongated NNW-SSE, no central condensation.  Forms a pair with NGC 672 8' NE.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 1727 photographically on 29 Nov 1896 with his 20" reflector from his Starfield Observatory in England.  He reported (AN 3429) "It is nearly as large as NGC 672 and distant from centre to centre 8' only; nucleus consists of 6 faint stellar condensations forming a straight line in the direction south following to north preceding and there are 6 or 7 very faint condensations of nebulosity near the preceding margin; 15th mag star on the north preceding margin and a 16th mag star at the south following end of the nucleus."  Roberts was very amazed that this galaxy was missed by WH, JH and at Birr Castle (7 observations of NGC 672) and he felt this object must have "come into the state of visibility during the past half century."

At 488x, this is a very interesting annular planetary with a relatively thick brighter rim that appears clumpy and a dark center.  The rim dims, though, on the west side, so the annularity is incomplete.  Overall the impression is a thick crescent spanning 270°.


18" (11/17/08): immediately picked up at 175x as a small bluish disc, ~12" diameter.  Situated within a distinctive 20' curving chain of stars that passes through much of the field.  Very good contrast gain using an OIII filter.  At 450x, the planetary is slightly elongated WNW-ESE, ~15"x12", and weakly annular.  At 800x it appeared irregularly brighter along the rim with a knotty structure, particularly along the northern half.  Located 30' SE of mag 3.4 Epsilon Cas.

The spectrum consists of a bright band having wavelength of about 5000.  Therefore, this object has been assumed to be a gaseous nebula."


Based on Crossley photographs, Heber Curtis (1918) described, "central star about mag 14.  Nearly round disk 13" in diameter, with an indistinct ring effect, strongest in the north and south and fading out along an axis in pa 90° [E-W]."

ESO 477-020, situated just 3.4' SW, appeared slightly fainter (nearly fairly faint), small, slightly elongated WSW-ENE, 30"x20".  A mag 13.5 star is 1' ENE and a mag 15.5 star was just visible 1' SE.

ESO 477-022, situated 11' NE, was very faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 ~E-W, brighter along the major axis, ~40"x20".  Situated 3' NNE of a mag 9.5 star.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1768 = Sw. XI-33 on 8 Oct 1896 and reported "eeeF; pS; R; 3 9m st near sf form equilateral triangle; ee diff[icult]."  His position is about 4' S of ESO 477-021 and the three bright stars are south-following.  But his position is also 3' SE of ESO 477-020 and the MCG chose this galaxy as IC 1768.  As ESO 477-021 is brighter by a 1/2 mag or so, it is much more likely the one Swift found.  Swift's combined 11th list gives the discovery date on the 18th but he apparently left for a trip to the east coast on that date and in an earlier published list in AJ, the discovery date is stated as 8 October.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 1773 = Big. 372 on 24 Dec 1897 while searching for NGC 804.  As Swift's RA was 22 seconds too large Bigourdan mistook a faint star for NGC 804 and when he picked up Big. 372 = NGC 804, he assumed it was new.  So IC 1773 is a rediscovery of NGC 804 with discovery priority to Swift. See Corwin's notes.

24" (12/28/16): at 432x; faint, very small, round, 20" diameter, low surface brightness patch with no structure.  UGC 1597 = Mrk 1018 is 16' NW and logged as fairly faint, slightly elongated N-S, 25"x20".  Two 13th magnitude stars are 50" NW and 1.0' W and a mag 14.5 star is 1.0' ESE.


In the 1980s, prominent broad lines appeared in the optical spectrum of Mrk 1018, a black-hole system and it was classified as a Sy1. The leading explanation for this change is that the accretion rate onto the black hole increased, energizing more of the gas and expanding the size of the broad-line region. But in 2016 it was found that in the past five years, Mrk 1018 had returned to its original state. This unusual transition is thought to be due to a decrease in the black-hole accretion rate.

John Herschel discovered NGC 823 = h196 on 14 Oct 1830 and recorded "A vF double star enclosed in a vF neb."  Herschel also observed this nebula at the Cape (h2460) and gave the same description.


Lewis Swift found this object on 8 Oct 1896 searching for Comet 1889V (Brooks).  Sw. XI-34 (later IC 1782) was described as "vF; D* of = mag in nebulosity.  Curious object."  He added the note "This appears like a nebulous double star, but I think it is simply a double star in a nebula.  There is a vast difference between a nebulous star, and a star in a nebula."  Dreyer must have missed the close match of Swift's and JH's position and their descriptions are virtually identical.  So, NGC 823 = IC 1782.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (10/13/07): NGC 896 and IC 1795 form a bright, detailed HII region at the NW corner of the huge IC 1805 HII ring ("Heart Nebula").  This complex is split into three or 4 distinct sections by dust lanes (LDN 1359).  The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'.  To the west of the mag 10 star is a dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, moderately high surface brightness patch (NGC 896) of 2' diameter.  To the east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and following this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length.  It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has a small, brighter patch.  Initially, I thought the complex ended here on the NE side, but then additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west for several arc minutes increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.


17.5" (11/27/92): observation at 100x using an OIII filter.  This is the northeastern section of a large emission complex with NGC 896.  Very large, about 10' diameter, roundish, fainter than NGC 895 but still moderately bright.  A mag 9.5 star is embedded at the SE edge and several fainter stars are superimposed.  A small detached piece of nebulosity is visible about 10' N with a mag 11.5 off the south edge and several fainter stars are at the edges or superimposed.  NGC 896 and IC 1795 form the NE component with the IC 1805 ("Heart Nebula") complex spread out to the SE.

IC 1805 = LBN 656 = W4 = Ced 7 = Sh 2-190 = LBN 654 = Cr 26 = Mel 15 = Heart Nebula

02 32 42 +61 27; Cas

V = 6.5;  Size 100'x80'


18" (10/13/07): IC 1805, which is dubbed the "Heart Nebula", is a cluster (Cr 26 = Melotte 15) involved with a huge emission complex (LBN 654) . The central cluster Mel 15 was striking at 73x, consisting of a 20' scattered group of mag 8 and fainter stars (I estimated 17 stars mag 8-10.5). Embedded within the group is a smaller, fairly rich, 4'x2.5' oval ring with over three dozen stars. Most of the stars are located along the irregular ring, itself, and not in the interior. On the SW side is the brightest member mag 8 HD 15558, an O5-type giant, which has a mag 10.5 companion at 10" separation (ADS 1920). The central region is richest around this pair with 9 or 10 stars in total packed into a 1.6' region.


Adding an OIII filter, the cluster was encased in a fairly bright, irregular glow, ~12-15' in diameter and extending mostly to the east of the cluster. There appears to be dark lanes or obscuring dust involved as the surface brightness is irregular with brighter filaments within the glow. Fainter nebulosity extends to the east and then abruptly bifurcates into two branches, one heading NE and the other SE. There's a sharp border to the nebulosity at the split as the sky directly east immediately darkens, adding to the contrast.


Following the stream of nebulosity to the NE, it extends roughly 20' in that direction but then curves back sharply towards the west where it meanders for 30'-40', ending about 30' N of the cluster. Only 20' E of the bend at the NE corner is the fairly large open cluster, NGC 1027 (see notes) .


The southern river of nebulosity can be followed around in a huge loop. First it gently curves to the south or SSE for ~40' and then loops back sharply towards the west (this band forms the southern boundary of the "Heart") for at least 40', heading towards a distinctive N-S string of 5 stars with a length of 6'. This group is catalogued as Markarian 6 = Stock 7. At the south end of Mrk 6 are two doubles, ∑264 = 8.6/9.8 at 17" and ∑263 = 10/11 pair at 17".


At this point, the rim bends to the north and brightens noticeably in a 10' patch. It dims and continues on further to the north, passing about 25' W of the cluster and fades out pretty close to NGC 896, a nearly isolated bright patch to the NW of the main structure.  Near the northwest end of IC 1805 is Tombaugh 4, a low surface brightness cluster that requires high power to partially resolve.


I had now traced around the entire outline of the "Heart Nebula" visible on wide-field images, scanning over a degree and a half from north to south and perhaps 1.25° in extent from west to east. The entire outline, including the weaker interior glow, was also visible at 12.5x in my 80mm finder using an OIII filter, although without the detail visible in the main scope.


NGC 896 and IC 1795 are parts of a fairly bright, detailed region at the NW corner of this huge ring. The complex appears split into three or 4 distinct sections by dust lanes (LDN 1359). The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'. To the west of the mag 10 star is a dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, moderately high surface brightness glow (NGC 896) of 2' diameter. To the east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and east of this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length. It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has another small, brighter patch. Initially, I thought the complex ended here on the NE side, but additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west, increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.


Comparing my descriptions to the MegaStar outline, I noticed that the cluster Mrk 6 (perhaps it's an asterism) is not plotted, although the brighter stars are, of course. Secondly, the outline shows a large gap between the NW end of the Heart and NGC 896. Visually, it appeared the Heart Nebula extended closer to 896. Finally, I picked up additional nebulosity to the north of NGC 896 not shown on MegaStar. At the section of the rim ~25' W of Mel 15 is the "bright-rimmed cloud" BRC 5, which was not noticed visually, though contains many T Tauri candidates.


17.5" (11/27/92): about 125 stars forming a bright, very large 40' field at 100x.  In the center is an oval ring consisting of about 30 stars within a 4'-5' diameter including a bright 8th magnitude multiple star (Stein 368).  The brighter stars in the outer region form a rough incomplete circular outline.  Using 100x with an OIII filter, the associated nebulosity (LBN 654) is clearly entwined within a large portion of the cluster.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1805 photographically with the discovery communicated directly to Dreyer.  The NGC position is off by 1 tmin in RA (same as IC 1824 = NGC 1027).  Barnard gave a corrected position in his Atlas of the Milky Way.


The Heart (IC 1805) and Soul (IC 1848) nebulae are part of the Cas OB6 Association, a sprawling complex of gas, dust and massive O- and B-class stars at a distance ~7500 light years in the Perseus Arm.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1814 = Sw. XI-40 on 22 Dec 1897 and reported "pB; pS; vE."  There is nothing at his position but 40 seconds of RA east is NGC 964.  This galaxy was discovered by John Herschel on 1 Sep 1834 and described as "B, pmE, psbM, 30" long; position 215.7 degrees."  So, IC 1814 = NGC 964, with discovery priority to Herschel.

24" (12/6/18): at 260x, this number possibly applies to the double star HDO 60, a mag 9.2/10.5 pair at 9" separation.  It was easily separated at 220x, though when discovered the separation was considerably less and the pair might have appeared nebulous.  Bu 261, a close mag 7.9/9.2 pair at 3", lies 5' NW with a very wide mag 10.5 component 1' SE.


SIMBAD identifies ESO 416-015 as IC 1845.  At 260x, this galaxy appeared fairly faint, fairly small, oval 3:2 NW-SE, 30"x20", slightly brighter core, fairly low surface brightness.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 1845 = Sw. XI-44 on 22 Dec 1897 and noted it as "eeF, S, R, D[ouble] * np".  There is nothing near his position except a mag 10.3 star, which hardly could be called "eeF".  Corwin suggests this number refers to the double star, a mag 9.2/10.3 pair at 9" (only 5" separation in 1870), which is situated 1 minute of RA west of Swift's position.  Furthermore, there is a very bright and wide double roughly 4' NW that would fit Swift's position.  ESO suggested ESO 416-015, situated about 40 seconds of RA east of Swift's position, might be IC 1845 (this is the identification adopted by SIMBAD, but there is no double star northwest, so this identification seems less likely.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1846 = J. 3-952, along with IC 1850 and 1852, on 7 Jan 1896.  His position matches UGC 2265 = PGC 10573 and this identification is secure.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1109, discovered by Albert Marth in a large group, refers to IC 1846, though Marth's RA is 2 minutes east.   Marth's positions for NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117 are off by differing amounts, so this identification is very insecure and other assignments are possible.


UGC, MCG, CGCG, PGC and HyperLeda label this galaxy as IC 1846, but NED and SIMBAD give NGC 1109 as the primary designation with IC 1846 as an alternate designation.    See my notes, Corwin's notes and Courtney Seligman's entry for NGC 1109.

18" (10/13/07): I only took a fairly quick look at this huge HII region ("Soul Nebula" or "Baby Nebula") at the end of the evening after a long examination of IC 1705 ("Heart Nebula").  In comparison, portions of this object clearly have a higher surface brightness using an OIII filter at 73x.  Near the center is an E-W elongated, scattered group of stars (Cr 32), ~10'x4' in size.  On the west end are two mag 7.3/8.3 stars (2' pair of O-class stars: HD 17505 (the primary ionization source) and HD 17520) with a number of fainter stars huddled nearby.  About 60' to the ENE is another larger, scattered group (Cr 34).  Weak nebulosity is evident throughout the field without a filter.


Adding an OIII filter greatly increases the contrast and nebulosity is fairly prominent in several different sections.  About 20' E of Cr 32 is a brighter, elongated patch.  To the east of this patch is a dark lane or intrusion and on the eastern side is a brighter, 10' circular glow (IC 1871) with an irregular outline. IC 1871 is located roughly 45' ENE of Cr 32.  This patch is irregular in surface brightness with brighter streaks.  A larger region spreads out to the east of the cluster increasing the total length to over 1.5 degrees.  I also noticed brighter regions of nebulosity to the west of Cr 32, but didn't take notes on this area or try to follow the entire outline of the complex.


17.5" (10/2/99): at 100x, this large but weak grouping is dominated by a 2' pair of mag 7/8 stars which are both surrounded by several close, faint companions.  The surrounding one degree field is undistinguished but it appears weakly concentrated around the bright pair.  Faint nebulosity is visible in portions of the field.  At 220x, the view is striking with ~12 stars huddled around the southern mag 9 star including a nice pair of mag 12 stars nearly collinear and equally spaced.  The brighter mag 7 star (∑306) is surrounded by 8-10 companions.  The 20' field is fairly rich but scattered with a matched pair of mag 9 stars ~10' N.


Using a UHC filter at 100x, the field is immersed in a very large, faint nebulosity about a degree in length, elongated E-W.  A large, bright region elongated N-S is at the east end, ~35  following the core, and seems detached from the main cloud.  It surrounds a weak scattered group (Cr 34) that is devoid of stars in the center.  The main body of nebulosity has a sharper border and is generally brighter to the north of the core and fades into the background on the south side.  The outline is interesting on the north side with irregular extensions and bulges.  A small brighter circular patch stands out at the west end about 10' W of the core.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1848 photographically and notified Dreyer directly.  The IC description reads "Cl, st F, extends 8 min. f, in F neby."  The Heart (IC 1805) and Soul (IC 1848) nebulae are part of the Cas OB6 Association, a sprawling complex of gas, dust and massive O- and B-class stars at a distance ~7500 light years in the Perseus Arm.

The NGC identification from Marth of this galaxy is very uncertain, although it was correctly placed by Javelle (IC 1850).  The galaxy chosen by the RNGC is probably incorrect.

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1111, found by Marth in 1863, refers to this galaxy although Marth's RA is 1.0 minute further east.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1852 = J. 3-956, along with IC 1846 and 1850, on 7 Jan 1896.  His position is a good match with UGC 2293 = PGC 10660.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1112, found by Marth in 1863, refers to this galaxy though his position 1 min of RA further east.  Marth's positions for NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117 are all off in RA, so this identification is not definite but very possible.  See my notes, Corwin's notes and Courtney Seligman's website entry for NGC 1109.



Albert Marth discovered NGC 1112 = m 77 on 2 Dec 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and logged "F, pS".  This is the third in a group of 8 galaxies he discovered that night, several of which (NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117) have identification problems because of poor positions or possibly he confused faint stars as nebulous.


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 1112 may refer IC 1852 = UGC 2293 = PGC 10660.  Stephane Javelle discovered this galaxy on 7 Jan 1896 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory.  Marth's position is exactly 1.0 min of RA following IC 1852 and matches in declination.  CGCG, UGC and MCG label this galaxy IC 1852, while RNGC, PGC, RC3 and Megastar identify it as NGC 1109.  RNGC classifies NGC 1112 as nonexistent.  Finally, HyperLEDA equates IC 1852 with NGC 1109.  Although NGC 1112 = IC 1852 is a reasonable match, given all the problems in this region this identification is very uncertain.

E.E. Barnard found IC 1883 on on 26 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  His discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer and not announced in any of his papers.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by Lewis Swift on 18 Oct 1884 and recorded in his first discovery list as I-5 (later NGC 1212) with the description "S; R; vvF.  Right angled with 2 stars.  In field with Algol".  Swift's position is poor, 40 seconds of RA west of UGC 2560, but his description of the two stars applies to this galaxy.  Barnard and Dreyer assumed this was probably a new object due to Swift's poor position.  So, NGC 1212 = IC 1883, with discovery priority to Swift.

Lewis Swift found IC 1943 = Sw. XI-55 on 3 Oct 1897 and recorded "pB, S, R".  There is nothing near his position but Harold Corwin suggests Swift may have made a 10 minute error in RA.  If so, then IC 1943 = NGC 1411.  The dec matches and the description is appropriate. Swift made a similar error of 10 minutes in RA for four objects discovered on 1 Sep 1888; IC 895, IC 1028, IC 1045 and IC 511. See Corwin's notes for IC 1943.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): IC 1947 is a faint companion to NGC 1356, located just 2.2' SW of the much brighter galaxy.  At 260x it appeared faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~0.5'x0.25'.  Forms the west vertex of a small triangle with a mag 12.7 star 1' NE and a mag 11.7 star 1.3' SSE.


DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 1947 = DS 206 from a plate taken on 14 Oct 1898 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.

24" (11/23/19): at 375x; moderately bright, large, slightly elongated, 1.5'-2' diameter, small brighter core seemed offset north of the center.  At times a brighter "spine" or central bar was visible extending in a N-S orientation.  The surface brightness was fairly low and irregular with a patchy appearance.  This galaxy is situated just 9' N of 4.3 magnitude Tau 5 Eri and it helped to place the star outside the field.


ESO 548-036, 6.1' SSW, was fairly faint (quite easy), elongated 5:2 ~N-S, ~40"x16", small bright core.   A mag 12.7 star is 1.4' N.  This galaxy is situated just 6' NW of the mag 4.3 star!


13.1" (10/10/86): fairly faint, very large, diffuse, oval WNW-ESE, weak concentration.  Located 9' N of the bright star Tau 5 Eridani (V = 4.3) that detracts from viewing.  Member of the NGC 1332 group?


DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 1953 = DS 213 from a plate taken in 1899 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  He reported "vF, cL, spir or ring neb."  Based on photographs taken at the Helwan observatory in 1927-31, IC 1953 was described as "F, R, 2' dia, spiral with a pF ncl, vlE [bar] 160°, [spiral arms] showing condensations and absoprtion on the preceding side."  ESO 548-040, 2.6' NW of IC 1953, was also reported as new.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x this was a surprisingly bright and detailed IC galaxy that was missed by John Herschel!  Appears elongated ~2:1 WSW-ENE, ~2.8'x1.4' with a broad concentration to a large, brighter core.  With direct vision a small brighter nucleus was visible at the center.  There was a strong impression of spiral structure with slightly enhanced arcs (probably portions of spiral arms) extending east of the core on the south side and west of the core on the north side (this is consistent with images of the galaxy).


Robert Innes discovered IC 1954 in 1898 with the 7-inch Merz refractor at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope.  His discovery position in MN, 59, p339 is 12 seconds of RA too large.  DeLisle Stewart also found this galaxy on a plate taken on 14 Oct 1898 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.

Lewis Swift found IC 1963 = Sw. XI-56 on 7 Sep 1897 (given as 27 Sep in his fourth discovery list from Lowe Observatory) and logged "pB; S; eeeE; a hair line 90°.  See note."  The note mentions "these [along with IC 2135] are the most interesting nebulae I have ever seen, especially No. 56 [IC 1963], which is a nebulous hair-line of one uniform size from end to end."  His second position was 37 seconds of RA too far west, but the description matches IC 335, which Swift discovered 10 years earlier.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1970 = Sw. XI-57) on 17 Nov 1897 and recorded "eeeF; vS; eeE; a ray, 90°; B * following."  His position is 7' too far west-southwest, but the identification is certain based on the description.  DeLisle Stewart measured an accurate position using an Arequipa plate taken in 1901 and noted "eF, vS, eE at 75°."  Stewart's position angle is accurate.

17.5" (1/12/02): moderately bright, moderately large, elongated nearly 2:1 NW-SE, 1.3'x0.7', bright core.  Situated in a group of three mag 11/12 stars with a mag 12 star 1.6' SE.  Located 38' SE of NGC 1398 in northeast Fornax.


Lewis Swift found IC 1981 = Sw. XI-58 on 26 Dec 1897 at Echo Mountain in the San Gabriel mountains and recorded "eF, eS, lE, * close nf".  His position is 37 seconds of RA west of ESO 482-029 = PGC 13520, though the identification is certain.  The correct RA was reported in Robert Baker's 1933 "Catalogue of 985 Extragalactic Nebulae in a Region in Fornax and Eridanus".  This galaxy was probably discovered by John Herschel in 1835, but his position for NGC 1412 = h2574 was 40' too far north (either a recording or copying error).  So, NGC 1412 = IC 1981, both with poor positions.


Both NGC 1412 and IC 1981 were reported as not found in 1935 at the Helwan observatory on plates taken in 1927-31 (Bulletin 38).  ESO and MCG use only the IC designation but both designations are given in NED, HyperLeda and SIMBAD.  Included in my RNGC Corrections #6 and Corwin's notes.

17.5" (12/16/95): IC 348 is an unusual object consisting of a scattered group of stars with associated nebulosity situated near a large dark cloud virtually devoid of stars.  The cluster consists of 15 stars of varying magnitudes in a 6' group located 5'-10' S of Omicron = 38 Persei (V = 3.8).  The brightest star in the group is mag 8.4 SAO 56680, which has two nearby companions and the group is clearly encased in a fairly bright reflection nebula, ~3' diameter.  The star at the southwest end of the cluster is a nice close evenly matched double (∑437 = 9.8/10 at 11").  The immediate 50' low power field to the south is strangely devoid of almost all stars! (Barnard 3 and 4).  Omicron also has a halo but this appears to be scattered light.


E.E. Barnard found IC 1985 on a plate taken 6 Dec 1893 at Lick Observatory.  The IC position matches the brightest star in the IC 348 cluster. So, IC 1985 = IC 348.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1993 = Sw. XI-62 on 19 Nov 1897 and logged "eF; L; cE; 7 1/2m in contact; ee diff."  In his Astronoical Journal list (15th object is the 5th discovery list from Lowe Observatory), Swift mentions the star "nearly obliterates it" and has a note "it seems strange, although in close contact if not partly superimposed on the star, that it was not found long ago.  I think it would, could it be detached from the star, be quite an interesting one.
