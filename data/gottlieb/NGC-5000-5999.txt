William Herschel discovered NGC 5003 = H III-655 on 9 Apr 1787 (sweep 725) and recorded "vF, pS, lbM".  There was confusion in the transit time and he gave a range of 3 minutes in RA (offset 5-7 min 26 sec preceding and 2° 57' north of 19 CVn).  UGC 8228 is located 7 min preceding the offset and 3' south, and Harold Corwin found that additional systematic errors account for the other differences.  UGC 8228 is not labeled NGC 5003 in the UGC, MCG (+07-27-033) or CGCG (217-013).  RNGC and PGC misidentify MCG +07-27-037 = PGC 45732 as NGC 5003.

At 220x it appeared faint, fairly small, round, 0.8' diameter, almost even surface brightness.  Located 1.5' N of a mag 10 star, which is the southeast of three stars in a 2.5' string with two mag 12 stars.  This galaxy is generally identified as IC 4381.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 5008 on 18 May 1862 and noted a mag 10 star preceded by 1.1 seconds of time and 95" north.  There is nothing at his position and his object was not recovered by Bigourdan or Reinmuth.  Harold Corwin found that UGC 9073 = PGC 50629 is exactly 1 hour of RA east of d'Arrest's position and a mag 10.5 star precedes by 1.2 seconds, but it is just under 90" south (not north).  So NGC 5008 = UGC 9073.


Stephane Javelle independently discovered this galaxy, along with a nearby companion to the northeast, on 15 Jun 1895 and listed them as J. 1294 and J. 1295 in his discovery papers.  Dreyer, of course, assumed they were new objects and catalogued the pair as IC 4381 and 4382.  So, NGC 5008 = IC 4381. Because of the poor NGC position, this galaxy is known as IC 4381 in modern catalogues and RNGC classifies NGC 5008 as "Not Found".

17.5" (5/27/00): at 220x this moderately bright GC appeared 6'-7' diameter with a very bright 2' core and ~50-60 stars resolved.  At 380x, perhaps 75 stars were resolved, mostly in the outer halo and the edges of the small, bright, concentrated core.  A brighter mag 12 star is just NE of the core, but most of the resolved stars are mag 13.5-15.  The halo is fairly rich, but unevenly distributed with more stars resolved on the north side.  Towards the edges of the halo the globular thins out and appeared straggly, with a maximum diameter 8'-9'.


17.5" (5/10/86): at least 50 stars resolved mostly in the outer halo which reaches 6' diameter.  Contains a very bright core that is very mottled.  Many stars are superimposed over the core.


13.1" (5/21/82): outer halo of faint stars resolved.


Johann Elert Bode discovered M53 = NGC 5024 = h1558 on 3 Feb 1775.  Charles Messier independently discovered it on 26 Feb 1777.


William Herschel made his first observation on 30 May 1783 with his 6-inch and noted "more than a suspicion of stars."  On 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 170) he described M53 as "one of the most beautiful objects I remember ever to have seen in the heavens; The cluster appears under the form of a solid ball consisting of small stars quite compressed into one blaze of light, with a great number of loose ones surrounding it and distinctly visible in the general mass.  See fig. 2 [which shows it resolved into numerous stars]."


John Herschel described it on 6 May 1826 as "A most beautiful highly compressed cluster. Stars very small, 12...20m; with sc st to a considerable dist; irreg R, but not globular. Comes up to a blaze in the centre; indicating a round mass of pretty equable density."  On 25 May 1827, he logged "Seen by Mr. Baily. A fine compressed cluster, with curved appendages like the short claws of a crab running out from the main body."


Wilhelm Struve found it again in 1825 or 1826 and included it in a list of 9 "Nebulae dectae" in the appendix to his main catalogue of double stars.  In his 1844 Bedford Catalogue, William Smyth called M53 a "brilliant mass of minute stars" and a "ball of innumerable worlds."

48" (4/20/17): at 488x; very bright, very large, elongated 5:2 N-S, some spiral structure is evident.  Very well concentrated with an extremely bright, elongated core roughly 1'x0.5'.  A low surface brightness spiral arm extends from the core on the north side and hooks sharply south on the west side of the halo.  It brightens and appears to end just west of a superimposed mag 14.5 star, situated 1.3' NNW of center.  A detached section of this arm was also seen due west of the core, just west of a superimposed mag 15.7 star [0.9' WSW of center].


Although arm structure was not distinguishable on the south side, a brighter knot was visible (at the sharp bend of an arm) 2.4' due S of center.  It was roughly 15" in diameter and aligned with the major axis of the core.  This HII complex is listed in NED as NGC 5033:[EKS96] 229, from the 1996 "An Atlas of H II Regions in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies" by Evans et al.


24" (5/22/17 and 5/27/17): at 124x and 282x; very bright and large impressive spiral, elongated 5:2 N-S, ~7'x2.8'.  Sharply concentrated with a very bright, very elongated core region and an enhanced central axis or bar that increases to a sharp, intense nucleus.  There is a strong impression of spiral structure in the halo with slightly brighter and darker regions.  A very weak enhancement or HII region is 2.4' due south of center with an hint of an arm segment curving through this patch.  An extremely faint, nearly stellar knot (only identified with a DSS image) is 1.3' W of center just northwest of a dim mag 15.7 star in the halo.  A brighter mag 14.5 star is superimposed 1.4' NNW of center.

Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant on 1 Mar 1851, noted "an appendage [arm] preceding."  The arm was mentioned again on 19 Apr 1862: "The patch p[receding] is vF, yet distinctly seen as far as in sketch, but I suspect it joins n end of neb."   R.J. Mitchell, observing on 3 May 1858, noted "I also think I see a neb knot sf, in the direction of major axis of neb, but was interrupted by clouds."  This "knot" is mostly likely the HII complex NGC 5033:[EKS96] 229, situated 2.4' south of center.

The other stars are mag 10 and fainter, except for a mag 9.4 star on the southwest side.  At lowest power, another 15'x5' (elongated NW-SE) bright, scattered group also caught my attention.  It is situated to the southwest of the NGC star cloud and contains many more brighter stars.  Mag 7 HD 114886 is on its southeast end, along with at least a half-dozen additional mag 8-9 stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5045 = h3475 on 16 Jun 1835 and reported "A great cluster or a surprisingly rich portion of the milky way.  It contains 34 stars 11m, and perhaps 150 or 200 of less magnitudes in the field."  At his position (given here) is a rich milky way field, but no distinct cluster.  The RNGC description is "NOCL?".  SIMBAD gives a position 3 min of RA further west, though there is no cluster there either.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 5045 might be a duplicate observation of NGC 5155, nearly 10 min of RA following.  JH's descriptions are quite similar, however both objects were recorded on the same sweep, so this would require some kind of mix-up on his part.

17.5" (5/10/86): about two dozen faint stars resolved at 286x over a faint background haze.  Very weak concentration with no core.  Appears similar to a faint, resolved open cluster.  A mag 9.5 star is off the east side, 6.5' from the center.


8": faint, fairly large, pale, no resolution.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5053 = H VI-7 = h1569 on 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 170) and recorded "an excessively faint cluster of stars intermixed with resolvable nebulosity 8 or 10' diameter.  The stars are so small that they cannot be seen without the greatest attention. 240 verified it beyond all doubts."  There is nothing at his position, but 2 min of RA west is this low surface brightness globular.


John Herschel described the GC as "vL; eF; a cluster of stars 19 or 20m, with 4 or 5 = 15m; irreg R, vgvlbM; diam at least 8 or 10'.  A most curious and interesting object.  The stars are just discernable.  So faint, might easily be overlooked."  He also mentioned the RA of his father was "very much out" so he nearly lost the observation.

48" (4/21/17): at 488x and 697x: very bright, large, very irregular 3-armed spiral.  Strongly concentrated with an intensely bright core and quasi-stellar nucleus.  A thin strong arm is attached to the core on the west side.  It shoots nearly straight north, aiming east of a mag 14 star 2.3' NW of center and quickly dimming as it heads towards MCG -03-34-040, a companion 2.6' NNW of center.   A second arm begins on the north side of the core.  It curls east towards a mag 13.5 star, 1.3' NE of center, and separates from the core.  It then dims to a very low surface brightness and curves south, ending ~2' SE of center.  A third arm starts on the east side of the core and extends south, ending at a brighter patch or HII region [1.2' SSE of center].  NGC 5044, the brightest of a fairly rich group, lies 27' NW.


MCG -03-34-040 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, thin edge-on 6:1 NNW-SSE, 0.6'x0.1', fairly low even surface brightness.  The major axis of the axis "points" towards the core of NGC 5054.  The northwestern spiral arm of NGC 5054 heads towards this galaxy, but fades out before reaching it


24" (6/1/13): bright, large, elongated nearly 2:1 NNW-SSE, ~3.5'x2'.  Contains a large, bright core with a sharp, bright nearly stellar nucleus.  The overall outline and surface brightness is irregular with spiral structure evident.  A relatively thin, straight arm is attached on the west side of the core and shoots ~1.2' NNW, separating well from the central region. A second, lower contrast arm is attached at the NE side of the central region and hugs tightly along the eastern side of the core.  This arm was not resolved until it extended south of the central region.  A small, brighter knot (~10") is visible just north of the central region [~40" N of center]. A mag 13.5 star is just off the NE side, 1.3' from center, and a mag 14 star lies NW of the western arm, 2.2' from center.  Forms a pair with MCG -03-34-040 2.6' NNW. The companion appeared faint, small, very elongated 7:2 N-S (major axis aligned with the nucleus of NGC 5054), 22"x6", even surface brightness.  The NGC 5044 group (7 NGCs) lies 20'-30' NW.


8" (5/26/84): fairly faint, contains a brighter middle with a diffuse outer halo of low surface brightness; the edge of the halo is difficult to define.  One or two faint stars are involved.  NGC 5017, NGC 5037 and NGC 5044 all lie to the west.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5054 = H II-513 = h1568 on 31 Dec 1785 (sweep 503) and logged "cF, iR."  A second observation on 7 May 1787 (sweep 732) reads "pB, almost cB, pL, iF, but mbM."  JH noted "vF; R; 20"."

48" (4/20/17): This gorgeous spiral is sharply concentrated with a bright, mottled oval core that increases to an intensely bright nucleus.  Several low contrast dust lanes surround the core, particularly on the south side of the core, separated thin sections of spiral arms. A long, relatively broad dust lane crosses the halo E-W, roughly 2' south of center.  A very low surface brightness arm or section of the outer halo is visible beyond (south) of this dust lane.  A mag 9.3 star is superimposed in the outer halo [3.7' WNW of center].


48" (4/7/13): The "Sunflower Galaxy" is a classic example of a floccelent spiral with many short fragments forming the arms.  At 375x it appeared extremely bright and large, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 8'x4'.  A large, intense, mottled core increases to a small, brilliant nucleus.  The outer halo was resolved into several tightly wrapped spiral arcs that are separated by thin dust lanes.  The arm structure is most evident along the south side of the galaxy with the easiest arm at the outer edge, particularly where it separates at the western end.  The galaxy extends just beyond a mag 9.3 star (HD 115270) at the northwest edge.


UGCA 342, probably a detached section of the outer halo of M63, lies 8' WSW of center and 1.2' S of a mag 10.7 star.  It appeared extremely faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 E-W, 20"x10", very low surface brightness.


17.5": very bright, large, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 6'x3'.  There is a faint outer extension to the WNW (outer spiral arms?) that reaches extremely close to mag 8.7 SAO 44530 just 3.7' from the center.


13.1" (5/26/84): very bright, elongated NNW-SSE, broad moderate concentration, stellar nucleus.  The southern edge is more sharply defined while the northern side is more diffuse and extensive.  A mag 8.5 star is off the NW edge.


Pierre Méchain discovered M63 = NGC 5055 = h1570 on 14 Jun 1779.  On 18 Mar 1787 (sweep 717), William Herschel recorded "E from np to sf., 5 or 6' long and near 4' broad, a bright nucleus, very brilliant."  On 9 Apr 1787 (sweep 725) he logged "vB, 9 or 10' long, considerably broad, the brightness confined to a small place."  JH logged "B; pmE; vsmbM, almost to a *, pos 30° np to sf.  The sf end more diffused.  Has a bright star np and a double star following."


On 9 Mar 1850, LdR (or observing assistant George Johnstone Stone) noted M63 was "another fine and bright spiral."  Later observations couldn't confirm the spirality, though the galaxy is included in the list of 14 "Spiral or curvilinear" nebulae in LdR's 1850 PT paper.


Basen on Mt Wilson 60-inch photographs, Pease (1918) described M63 as a "bright, beautiful spiral 8' x 3' in p.a. 98°. Has an almost stellar nucleus. The whorls are narrow, very compactly arranged, and show numerous almost stellar condensations."

13.1" (7/5/83): fairly large, diffuse, no definite edges, almost round.  NGC 5087 lies 32' NE.  Member of the M83/Cen A group.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5068 = H II-312 on 10 Mar 1785 (sweep 709) and recorded "F, L, iR, brightest in the middle, but very gradually."


Julius Schmidt rediscovered it on 21 Jan 1865, published an offset from a nearby 9th mag star, but thought he had found comet Bruhns (AN 64, 63).  The next year (AN 64, 271), he retracted the observation and stated it was probably another comet or nebula.  Johann Palisa measured an accurate position on 20 Mar 1884, though referred to it as Schmidt's nebula from 1865, without reference to Herschel's original discovery.

Ormond Stone found NGC 5069 = LM 1-197 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  Stone's rough position (nearest min of RA) is just 17 sec of RA east and 1' south of NGC 5066, discovered two years earlier by Albert Marth on 30 May 1864. In the NGC description, Dreyer questions if NGC 5066 = NGC 5069 as the positions are fairly similar, and Harold Corwin equates the numbers.

Lewis Swift found NGC 5070 = Sw. III-67 on 3 Jun 1886 and recorded "eeF, eS, vf * v close, looks like a D* at first; another nr; 6 in field., H.III.117 [NGC 5076], II.193 [NGC 5077], III.118 [NGC 5079], R nova [NGC 5088] and GC 5730 [NGC 5072]."  Swift's position for NGC 5070 is 19 tsec of RA preceding and 2' south of NGC 5072 and falls in an empty section of sky.


The only galaxy nearby that matches this description is NGC 5072, which has a 14th magnitude star superimposed on the south end, giving the initial impression of a faint double star. So, based on Swift's description, NGC 5070 = NGC 5072.  Heinrich d'Arrest discovered this galaxy on 26 Apr 1867 and placed it accurately.


The RNGC misidentifies MCG -02-34-023 as NGC 5070.  This faint edge-on is located 3' NNE of NGC 5072.  The RNGC misidentification is listed in my RNGC Corrections #3, although misstated that the RNGC reversed the identifications of NGC 5070 and NGC 5072.

John Herschel discovered NGC 5086 = h3486 on 7 Apr 1837 within a group including NGC 5082, NGC 5090 and NGC 5091.  He described NGC 5086 as "eF, R, 15", the 2nd of a group of 4" and placed it 10 sec of RA west and 50" south of NGC 5090, the brightest in the group.  There is no galaxy at this offset, though very close to his position is a pair of mag 14-15 stars at 17" separation that Harold Corwin identifies as NGC 5086.


The RNGC misidentifies ESO 270-003 as NGC 5086.  This galaxy is located 3.4' due south of NGC 5090.  This error was noted in my RNGC Corrections #5.   ESO likely misidentifies ESO 270-001 as NGC 5086.  This galaxy is 12 sec of time west of NGC 5090 and 2' south.

See observing notes for NGC 5100.  The equivalence with NGC 5100 is uncertain and Reinmuth and Carlson identify NGC 5106 with a star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5106 = H II-22 on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 108) and recorded a "a vS and F neb, sp 59 Vir.  Its A.R. is about 13h 06 1/4m [No polar distance recorded].  While I looked into the finder to determine its situation I lost it, but shall endeavor to find it another night."  Dreyer noted in "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" there is no nebula in WH's place and this number probably refers to NGC 5100 (found by Marth), which is 35 sec preceding and 30' north of the assumed place of II-22."  In his NGC correction list, Dreyer repeats "II.22 must be = 5100."   Harold Corwin notes there are inconsistencies with this identification, so the identity NGC 5106 = NGC 5100 is "provisional".  See his notes for more.


Karl Reinmuth probably looked for NGC 5106 at the NGC position and reported "=*14.0; 13 14.3 +09 15 (1860) neb susp."  This was repeated by Dorothy Carlson and by the RNGC.

See observing notes for NGC 5111.  As far as RNGC 5111 = PGC 46719, it appeared very faint, small, slightly elongated E-W, 25" diameter, low even surface brightness.  A mag 13 star lies 1' NE.  Located 8' SW of NGC 5111 and a similar distance north of mag 7.8 SAO 157895.  The NGC identification is uncertain as Swift's position was poor and NGC 5110 may be a duplicate observation of NGC 5111.


Lewis Swift found NGC 5110 = Sw. III-71 on 3 Jun 1886 and recorded "eF, pS, R, in line with 2 pB stars".  His position is 6 sec of RA west and 2.4' south of NGC 5111 (discovered by WH).  This galaxy is collinear with two mag 12 and 13.5 stars to the northwest, matching Swift's description.


RNGC and PGC misidentify  PGC 46719 as NGC 5110.  This galaxy is 13 sec of RA west and 3.5' south of Swift's position.  More importantly, it is not in line with "2 pB stars" as Swift noted.  But Malcolm Thomson feels this galaxy is still a reasonable match.


Harold Corwin equates NGC 5110 with NGC 5111 as this galaxy is in a line with two mag 12-13 stars to the northwest.  In this case, Swift's position is 12 tsec E and 4' too far south.  Based on the description, NGC 5111 is a better match, though I'm surprised Swift would call this galaxy "eF" as the V magnitude is 11.7.

Lewis Swift probably found the galaxy again on 22 May 1897 and reported it in discovery list XI-156 (later IC 4236).  There is nothing at Swift's position, but exactly 10' north is NGC 5118.  So, likely IC 4236 is a duplicate of NGC 5118.  See Harold Corwin's notes for some discrepancies with Swift's published data in earlier lists.

18" (7/7/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): picked up at 228x as a rich, compact swarm of faint stars to the south of two mag 9.5 stars.  About two dozen mag 13-14.5 stars are resolved in a 2.5' circular region over haze.  A single brighter mag 11 star is near the east end of this small group.  Located just 2.5' SE of mag 9.5 HD 116492 and 5' SW of mag 9.5 HD 116628.  NGC 5155, a very rich and large Milky Way field, is immediately northeast.


Listed as "no cl?" in RNGC although shows up quite nicely at the eyepiece.  See identification notes.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5120 = h3496 on 16 Jun 1835 NGC 5120 and recorded "Cl class VI; oval; 4' l by 3' br; stars 12...16; an extremely rich clustering patch in the milky way, which is here superb."  About 3' southwest of JH's position is a fairly rich group of stars. This cluster is identified as Ru 166 in Lynga #5 and the Sky Catalogue 2000, and RNGC says "no cl?".

48" (4/13/10): at 330x there was a fascinating amount of structure in the wide, equatorial dark lane that bisects the galaxy.  The dust lane varied in width with fine structure resolved along its ragged, crenated edge.  The interior of the dust lane also varied in brightness with a bright patch close to the center, just following a bright mag 12 star near the south edge of the lane.  This patch is elongated with some structure and may be the visible portion of the obscured core.  Clouds interrupted this brief observation.


48" (5/9/18): at 610x and 813x; using a DSS2 (Red) finder chart, I easily star hopped over to the globular cluster [VHH81] 7, the first one discovered in NGC 5128 in 1980, starting at the double star HJ 4587 = 9.4/9.5 at 5".  I didn't see the see the GC initially at 610x, but bumping the power up to 813x it was identified with certainty about 30" SE of three brighter mag 15-16 stars.  The globular (V = 17.2) seemed stellar and was glimpsed for brief moments several times at the same position.


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I didn't take detailed notes with the 24", but the appearance was mesmerizing at 200x.  The equatorial dust lane was more full of contrast and exhibited finer texture and scalloped detail at the edges than I've observed previously in smaller scopes from Australia.


20" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 230x, Cen A nearly filled the 15' field.  The 15'x1' dark rift was fascinating with a scalloped, wavy edge and a thin streak was easily visible near the center within the rift.  This was easily the most detailed view I've ever had of Centaurus A.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 186x, Centaurus A appeared very bright with a large, prominent dust lane cutting a dark swath through the center from NW-SE.  The SW hemisphere is a bit larger and more prominent and contains a bright star.  There is a mag 12 star within the dust lane (west of center) with two very faint stars at both the NW and SW borders of the lane.  Some faint haze is superimposed near the center of the dark rift, following the star superimposed on the lane.


17.5" (3/12/88): bright, large, very large prominent dust lane oriented NW-SE.  The SW hemisphere is larger and brighter.  A star is superimposed at the south edge of the dust lane (west of center) and a bright star is superimposed on the SW hemisphere (south of center).


13" (4/24/82): wide dust lane bisects galaxy with the southwest hemisphere dominating in terms of size and brightness.  A very faint star is at the southwest edge of the dust lane.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5128 = D 482 = Centaurus A = h3501 on 29 Apr 1826 using his 9-inch f/12 homemade speculum reflector from Parramatta (near Sydney). It was discovered on the second night he started recording deep sky objects -- NGC 4945 was discovered just 20 minutes earlier!  He reported "A very singular double nebula, about 2.5' long and 1' broad, a little unequal: there is a pretty bright small star in the south extremity of the southernmost of the two, resembling a bright nucleus: the northern and rather smaller nebula is faint in the middle, and has the appearance of a condensation of the nebulous matter near each extremity.  These two nebulae are completely distinct from each other, and no connection of the nebulous matters between them.  There is a very minute star in the dark space between the preceding extremities of the nebula; they are extended in the parallel of the equator nearly."  His sketch (Figure 20) shows two parallel bands with a star between at one end.


John Herschel made several observations: on 1 Jun 1834 he logged "A most wonderful object; a nebula vB; vL; lE; vgmbM; of an elliptic figure, cut away in the middle by a perfectly definite straight cut 40" broad; pos = 120.3 ; dimensions of the nebula 5' by 4'. The internal edges have a gleaming light like the moonlight touching the outline in a transparency." On his next sweep he describing "[Two nebulae, or two portions of one separated by a division or cut.] The cut is broad and sharp. The two nebulae are very nearly alike. Perhaps the slit is larger towards the N.p. end, where there is a star between them. There is certainly a very feeble trace of nebula, an island as it were, running from this star between the sides of the slit."  He included a small sketch in a letter written a few days later to his Aunt Caroline (see plate IV, figure 2).


Pietro Baracchi made a detailed observation on 9 Apr 1885 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  He wrote in part "...two very elongated streaks running near one another with their inner edges parallel leaving a channel between them quite dark, about 9' long 50" broad.  A very very narrow streak like or string seems to emanate rom a star with the channel towards it n.p. end and run along its axis for about 3'.  This narrow streak is very faint.  The channel seems to open into a slightly wider spine bounded by much fainter nebulosity into a form a little elongated, irregularly approaching an elliptical shape.  But this n.p. end of the channel is not quite closed.  It leaves a perfect dark opening in the open n.p. of the object..."


In 1918 Heber Curtis mentioned Cen A as "almost certainly belong to the class of edgewise spirals with dark lane" based on descriptions or sketches, though in 1933 simply classified it as "diffuse.  Edwin Hubble, in his 1922 paper "A general study of diffuse galactic nebulae", thought it might be an emission nebula and included it in a table of "Diffuse Nebulae with Emission Spectra", along with M42, the Veil, M8, M16, M17, etc.  The Helwan Observatory description from 1921, based on a 30-inch photo from Knox-Shaw, also states "large patch of structureless and possibly gaseous nebulosity.", though no spectrum was taken. The Shapley-Ames catalogue (1932) classified it as an external nebula and in 1947 Harlow Shapley called it as an irregular galaxy.

At 76x (27 Panoptic), barely stands out as a distinct group as it resides in a very rich star field. Includes over two dozen mag stars roughly 11th magnitude. Two mag 8.5/9.5 stars (HD 116721 and 116689) to the NW by 6' and 9' are collinear with the center of the cluster.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5138 = D 312 = h3503 on 26 May 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 reflector at Parramatta.  He recorded "a pretty large faint nebula, about 5' diameter, irregular branched figure, resolvable, with considerably compression of the stars towards the central point. This precedes a star of the 7th mag, and a group of small stars follows, about 10' north of the nebula."

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x in excellent seeing, the view was absolutely stunning as the field was packed with thousands of pinpoint stars to the edge of the 30' field!  I noted the circular ring of stars near the center mentioned previously, but the large number of brighter, densely packed stars in the core and halo, superimposed on an incredibly rich mat of fainter stars was the real show.  The cluster is only broadly concentrated with very large, brighter core ~10' in diameter and the star density thins out very slowly all the way to 35' diameter.

Broadly concentrated with large, brighter core of at least 10' in diameter.  The core is extremely densely packed with layers of stars.  The elongated halo gradually thins but has no definite border out to 30'!  This is the largest and brightest globular in the sky (V = 3.7) and an obvious naked-eye blur, but lacks the strong central condensation of NGC 104 = 47 Tucana.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): although I've mentioned this feature on previous observations I was surprised to be drawn to a 1' circular ring of stars just north of the geometric center which is mainly filled with unresolved glow and appears like a darker "hole" near the center.  A second smaller and less distinct 30" ring of stars and darker center is adjacent to the south with the two rings externally tangent in the middle.


After the observation I checked John Herschel's description and found these comments on the star rings in the center: "One of these rings, 1.5' in diameter, is so marked as to give the appearance of a comparative darkness like a hole in the centre.  My attendant (J.S.) called up, who saw the hole and darkness, and described it as I have done above. On further attention the hole is double, or an oval space crossed by a bridge of stars. Position of axis = 150."


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x in excellent seeing, the view was absolutely breathtaking with wall-to-wall pinpoint stars in the 37' field!  There was a clear 3-dimensional effect with the 11.5-12.5 magnitude stars seemingly floating over a dense mat of fainter stars with the streamers in the halo reaching the edges of the field. I don't recall a more impressive view in the 12" from Australia, where the cluster was higher in the sky.


13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): In very good seeing early in the morning of the 20th, Omega Cen was a mesmerizing sea of a couple of thousand stars at 200x.  I set Omega just outside the field and let it drift through the field a few times.  The outer halo was an amazingly dense swarm of 12-13th magnitude stars over a background of fainter pinpoints of lights spilling over the edge of the field.  Very broadly concentrated to a large, brighter center although there is no well-defined core.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was the first object I viewed at Bargo with Les Dalrymple's 12" and I was not disappointed.  At 140x, it filled 2/3 of the field (over 25') and resolved into perhaps a few thousand stars down to the center.  The cluster seemed almost 3-dimensional with a lattice of brighter mag 12 stars superimposed on a dense background layer of mag 13-14 stars.  The density was generally uniformly high in the elongated halo except near the edge although the core shows more non-uniformity with a couple of darker patches.


17.5" (3/12/88): very large, very bright, fantastic at 220x with several hundred stars resolved in excellent seeing from east of Mt. Hamilton.  Very faintly visible to the naked eye in good conditions near the horizon from northern California.


13.1" (3/24/84): large, mottled disc covered with faint stars, well resolved outer halo.  Similar view but even better resolution on 2/23/85.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, very large, very broadly concentrated, about 25' diameter, over 100 stars resolved mag 12-13, many in curving streams over the entire disc.  Visible naked-eye.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): very prominent naked-eye as Omega Centauri culminated within 5° of the zenith from this southern location.  Huge in 10x30mm, though no resolution.


Ptolemy catalogued Omega Centauri = NGC 5139 = Lac I-5 = D 440 = h3504 as a star in the Almagest (150 AD).  Edmond Halley discovered its nebulous nature telescopically in 1676-77 from the island of St. Helena.  He included it in a short list of a half-dozen "luminous spots or patches" found while cataloguing southern stars.  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille reported "Naked eye, a 3rd mag star [10 Cen] in a fog. Telescope, [Half-an-inch aperture, 8x magnification] like a big diffuse comet."  James Dunlop first resolved the cluster on 7 May 1826 with his 9-inch speculum reflector and described "a beautiful large bright round nebula, about 10' or 12' diameter, easily resolvable to the very centre; it is a beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre; the stars are rather scattered preceding and following, and the greatest condensation is rather north of the centre: the stars are of slightly mixed mags, of a white colour. This is the largest bright nebula in the southern hemisphere." Of course, the cluster is an easy naked-eye object. Johann Bayer catalogued it as a 4th magnitude star (Omega) in the early 17th century.


John Herschel first observed Omega Centauri on 26 Feb 1834, a few days after setting up his 20-foot telescope in South Africa.  He wrote in his diary, "a most superb object - entirely resolved into stars of 13...14m.  All very nearly of the same size & most beautfilly graduating in respect of central condensation."


In a detailed observation on 20 Apr 1836, he recorded "Globular; Omega Centauri; diameter full 20'. It much more than fills the field. When the centre is on the edge of the field, the outer stars extend fully half a radius beyond the middle of it. The stars are singularly equal, and distributed with the most exact equality, the condensation being that of a sphere equally filled. - Looking attentively, I retract what is said about the equal scattering and equal sizes of the stars. There are two sizes 12th mag and 13th mag, without greater or less, and the larger stars form rings like lace-work on it. One of these rings, 1.5' in diameter, is so marked as to give the appearance of a comparative darkness like a hole in the centre. There must be thousands of stars. To the naked eye it appears as a star of 5th mag or 5.4, rather hazy. There is a * 9m on the S.p. border of it, about 4' or 5' south of centre, and several 8th mag are scattered far away.  My attendant (John Stone) called up, who saw the hole and darkness, and described it as I have done above.  On further attention the hole is double, or an oval space crossed by a bridge of stars.  Position of axis = 150°.  Altogether this object is truly astonishing."  The position in John Herschel's General Catalogue, as well as the NGC, is 10' too far north.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): gorgeous low power Milky Way field at 76x, but it was difficult to identify the cluster not having a finder chart.  Initially I was drawn to a striking asterism in the field consisting of a distinctive group of four stars forming a rough 8'x3' parallelogram with brightest member mag 7.8 HD 117356, but the enclosed stars were no richer than the surrounding field and it looked like an asterism.  Then I noticed that 12' S of the mag 7.8 star was an eye-catching double star = HJ 4591 (10.2/10.4) at 7" surrounded by a few faint stars over unresolved haze.  Increasing the magnification to 228x, this rich knot resolved into three dozen mag 14 and fainter stars in a 2'x1.5' roundish cluster with the double star on the following side and this was clearly NGC 5138.

Interestingly, the first observation by JH also describes a double system (probably following his father's lead): "vF; two close together, or one E nearly in meri.  A star 11m N."  His second observation simply states "eF, E, involves a star at the S end."  Dreyer's observation at Birr Castle on 4 Apr 1877 mentions "found only one neb, vF, vS, stellar no other neb found."


Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy again on 19 Mar 1887 and recorded it in list VI-58, but his position was 1 tmin too far west.  Dreyer, assuming it was new, catalogued it as NGC 5162.  So, NGC 5174 = NGC 5162.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 5189 was the last of 78 objects that I logged on 4/11/08 and the perfect end to a great evening with the 24".  At 200x using a UHC this amazing planetary displayed an extremely complex morphology.  Through the center is a bright, high surface brightness "bar" elongated WSW-ENE and ~1.5'x0.4' in size.  This central feature has an uneven surface brightness with a mottled texture. A mag 12 star is superimposed just north of the west-southwest end and the fainter central star is just south of the bar.  A close double star (~3.5") is superimposed just south of the west-southwest end.  At this end a spiral extension hooks around counterclockwise to the north and passes through a faint star and ends at a very faint small knot just north of the superimposed star.  A bright 10" knot is just south of the ENE end of the central "bar".  Attached to this knot is another extension that sweeps towards the southwest, ending less than 1' S of center.  About 50" E of the bright knot is another 10" knot that appears detached.  A mag 12 star is ~50" SW of this knot, just outside the halo of the planetary.  All of the brighter features are within a much fainter oval envelope, ~2.5'x2.0'.


18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the "Spiral Planetary" is certainly one of the most remarkably structured planetaries and would be famous if located in the northern hemisphere.  At 128x using a UHC filter, a high surface brightness "bar" at least 1' in length, elongated SW-NE forms the main body of the planetary.  The bar is slightly curved and has an irregular surface brightness.  On the NE end is a prominent bright knot, roughly 6" in size.  Nebulosity hooks below this knot, extending below the bar.  Above the southwest end of the bar is the brightest superimposed star and a hook of nebulosity sweeps up to the northwest, wrapping above this star.  The entire structure is encased in a much fainter oval envelope.  A total of five stars are superimposed including a very close double that is just south of the southwest end of the bar and the 14th magnitude central star situated southeast of the center of the bar.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this is a bright, strange-looking PN with a complex bar structure dubbed the "Spiral Planetary".  At 140x and UHC filter, it resembles a small barred spiral galaxy with prominent bar extending SW-NE with curved tips, ~1' in length embedded within a fainter, slightly elongated halo of ~2'x1.5'.  A few stars are superimposed.  At 186x, the "bar" is irregular and knotty with a bright knot at one end.  A mag 11 star is at the SW end with a couple of faint stars on the opposite end. The faint 14th magnitude central star is just south of the bar.  Located 6' NNW of mag 7.2 SAO 252366 in a rich star field in the NE corner of Musca.  NGC 5189 was a fascinating sight!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5189 = D 252 = h3514 on 1 Jul 1826 using his homemade 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector. This is one of three or four southern planetaries that he identified.  He recorded a "very faint nebula, about 25" diameter. It is very near a star of the 8th mag, and near the north following extremity of a crescent of very small stars." His position is off by 15', but the description is adequate to identify.


John Herschel recorded "A very strange object.  A nebula of oval fig, but having a central and brighter axis somewhat curved, and terminating in two masses brighter than the rest; diam about 90" or 100".  It involves 3 stars, one of which with 320 is double.  The principal star is 10m, the others eS; a multitude of other stars in field."  Sketched on Plate VI, figure 1.


Joseph Turner also made an excellent sketch of the planetary in 1874 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate VII, figure 68).  Figure 69 is based on Albert Le Sueur's earlier sketch.


Williamina Fleming found the planetary again in 1901 on a Harvard objective prism plate taken at the Arequipa station and reported it as new in Harvard Circular 60.  Dreyer missed the equivalence in position with NGC 5189 and recatalogued it as IC 4274 =  Fleming 96.  The North Polar Distance in the IC has a typo of 115°.  It should read 155° based on the original position, matching NGC 5189.

48" (5/12/12, 4/7/13, 4/30/19, 5/3/19): during these observations through Lowrey's 48" I focused on some of the stellar clusters and brighter knots in the spiral arms, which have a very high contrast with the large, dusty, darker regions between the arms.  The "southern" arm nearly merges with the core on the northeast side.  Two clusters and a cluster/HII region were seen as faint "stars" very close east and northeast of the core.  [BGG2008] A1 is a mag 17.5 "star" 30" NE of center and similar [BGG2008] 3cl-b is 30" E of center. The designations are from a 2008 study by Bastian et al.  A stellar HII region ([CCM69] 37A) is only 10" NE of 3cl-b.


As this arm unwinds clockwise to the west, two close very small, fairly bright knots ([CCM69] #77 in Carranza, Crilon and Monnet's "Kinematic Study of Ionized Hydrogen in M51" in A&A, 1, 479) are visible 1.6' W of center, just SE of a star.  A small bright knot (#71) is further out on this arm, 2.3' SW of center. The section of the arm between these knots is quite bright and mottled.  The southern arm then continues to swing around on the east side and heads north, with a lower surface brightness bridge to NGC 5195.


The "northern" arm begins on the south or southwest side of the core, and a series of small knots (#60/67) are along the inner south side, roughly 1' from center.  As the arm unwinds on the east side of the core, a large bright knot (#52) resides ~1.4' ESE of center.  The arm is quite bright in a large, clumpy region (#27/29) as it heads north in the direction of NGC 5195.  At the closest point to NGC 5195 are 4 very small knots; the brightest is #10, 2.6' NNE of center.  Very close southwest is #8 and just northwest is #5.  This arm has a sharp bend and shoots west on the north side and includes a moderately large, brighter patch (#90/91) 2' NNW of center. The arm fades somewhat as it unwinds further along the western edge of the halo.


48" (4/2/11): during this observation I focused on the attached companion NGC 5195. The entire connecting arm was always a prominent direct vision feature of the pair with variations in brightness and width along its length.  The arm brightened as it connected to NGC 5195.  The slightly oval core was extremely bright but nevertheless a very bright stellar nucleus punctuated the center.  The spiral arms had an extremely high contrast and appeared etched in the eyepiece like a photograph with a great deal of knotty structure.  The outer arm that sweeps clockwise to the north and then around the west side extended much further south (~5' from center) than I had ever previously seen and separated quite a bit from the main spiral.  Sprays of nebulosity looped off of NGC 5195 to the north (see notes).


18" (7/2/11): first view of type IIb supernova 2011dh in M51, which was discovered after the last time I could observe.  The magnitude was ~13.3.  The progenitor star of SN 2011dh is possibly an extremely unusual yellow supergiant with a massive blue companion that was leeching material off the yellow supergiant.


17.5" (3/28/87): stunning spiral structure, connecting arm visible with direct vision.  First observation with 17.5" on 23 Mar 1985.


13.1" (4/24/82): very bright, very large, bright nucleus.  Two winding spiral arms are obvious with a dark gap between the arms on the west side.  The connecting arm to NGC 5195 is definite although near my visual threshold.  There is a sharp bend in the outer arm at the south end of the galaxy. After this point, the arm trails faintly north to NGC 5195 located 4.6' from center.


8": bright, large, hint of spiral arms.


Charles Messier discovered M51 = NGC 5194 = h1622 on 13 Oct 1773 with a 3.5-inch refractor.  Johann Bode made an independent discovery on 5 Jan 1774, along with the first drawing using his 3-inch refractor.  Using his 12-inch (20-ft focal length) on 20 Sep 1783, William Herschel commented (clearly interested if it was a cluster), "most difficult to resolve; yet I no longer doubt.  In the southern nebula I saw several stars by various glimpses, in the northern also 3 or 4 in the thickest part of it, but never very distinctly."  Viewing with his 18.7-inch on 29 Apr 1788, he described "Two, the most south vB, L, surrounded with a beautiful glory of milky nebulosity with here and there small interruptions that seemed to show the glory at a distance."  On 12 May 1787 he recorded "B, a very uncommon object.  Nebulosity in the center, with a nucleus surrounded by detached nebulosity in the form of a circle; of unequal brightness in 3 or 4 places; forming altogether a most curious object."  He apparently never observed M51 with his 48-inch reflector (40-foot focal length).  John Herschel described M51 as "A very bright round nucleus surrounded at a distance by a nebulous ring" and as a "double ring, or rather one-and-half rings rather like an armillary sphere."


M51 was the first galaxy in which spiral structure was clearly seen.  The discovery was made by Lord Rosse (William Parsons) using his newly completed 72-inch Leviathan in the spring of 1845 (replacing the earlier 36-inch scope).  No observing logs were kept of the earliest observations, so the exact date in unknown, but spirality was not reported by Romney Robinson (director of the Armagh Observatory) and James South (double star observer) during their observation on 5-6 March 1845, which focused on resolvability.  In early April 1845 (possibly the 6th), William Parsons observed alone and "discovered" the spiral structure, producing a stunning sketch that was circulated at the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Cambridge in June 1845.  By 1850, M51 had been observed at least 28 times and a second, more dynamic sketch implying motion, was published in LdR's 1850 "Observations of the Nebulae" (plate XXXV, figure 1).


Probably using LdR's drawing as a "guide", William Lassell sketched the spiral structure and connecting arm on 12 May 1846 (in his notebook) with his 24" equatorially mounted reflector.  He made two detailed sketches using his 48" in 1862 from Malta, showing slightly variations in the spiral structure. Jean Chacornac made an excellent pencil sketch (unpublished) in 1862 using the 31" silvered-glass reflector of the Paris Observatory.  Using only a 9.6" refractor at Rome, Father Angelo Secchi claimed "even in our telescope it is easy to recognize the spiral and the two branches can be followed very well." (he often compared his telescopic views favorably with LdR's and Lassell's).


A bitter debate between Wilhelm Tempel and Dreyer began in 1878 after Tempel was highly critical of Lord Rosse's and William Lassell's sketches of spiral structure.  Tempel had only observed M51 through the 11" refractor at Arcetri, and although he sketched curving arcs in the halo, he felt Rosse and others were interpretating these features as spiral forms.  He wrote "one cannot fend off the thought that these forms and shapes are only figments of the imagination...".  On 29 Apr 1889 Isaac Roberts obtained the first photograph of M51, ending the debate.


As far as the origin of the nickname "Whirlpool Galaxy", Ormsby Mitchel's Sidereal Messenger column in November 1847 (Vol. 2, No. 4) announced "Lord Rosse's Whirlpool Nebula" and included a copy of his sketch.  The following year Romney Robinson described spiral nebulae "... resemblance to bodies floating on a whirlpool is, of course, likely to set imagination at work..."

48" (4/2/11): I was shocked by the detail and structure visible in the companion to M51 at 375x.  The main 2' portion of the galaxy has a striking asymmetric appearance with an extremely high surface brightness "bar" perhaps 2'x0.8' elongated N-S with a sharp light cutoff on the east side.  Attached on the east side of a bar is semi-circular "loop" extending about a 1' E and connected at the north and south end of the bar. The western loop portion of NGC 5195 was slightly brighter where it connected at the ends and the interior of this loop was irregularly darker.  On first glance there appeared to be an obvious short "arm" connected to the northeast end of NGC 5195 heading south, but then I realized this was the long connecting arm from M51 that brightened in the last 1' where it attaches to NGC 5195.  The entire connecting arm was always a prominent direct vision feature of the pair.  The center of the bar was sharply concentrated with an extremely bright, quasi-stellar nucleus.


At least three distinct plumes of nebulosity (referred to as the "crown") extended from NGC 5195 to the north. A broad wing of hazy nebulosity begins near the NE end (at the end of the connecting arm) and sweeps 2' to the north in a gentle curve.  A second shorter plume extends directly north from the north end of NGC 5195.  Finally a mass of very low surface brightness nebulosity spreads to the west from the southwest end of the galaxy and clearly sweeps towards the north for ~2.5'.


13.1": bright, fairly small, very irregular appearance.  Forms a double system 4.6' N of M51 and connected on the east side by a faint spiral arm of M51 which trails north on the east side to NGC 5195.  The following side is sharply cut-off due to dust and appears as a half disc.


Pierre Méchain discovered the northern component of M51 or NGC 5195 = H I-186 = h1623 on 20 Mar 1781 and commented "saw this nebula; effectively it is double.  The center of each is brilliant and clear; distinct and the light of each touches each other."  Messier mentioned this companion to M51 in his 1784 version of the catalogue in Connaissance de Temps, though it never received recognition as a separate Messier object.  WH found it on 12 May 1787 (sweep 734) and recorded "B, S, R, vgbM.  Just north of the former [M51]."  JH reported "B; R: vsbM to a star.  This nebula is the companion of M51 and is figured with it."


LdR and assistants described NGC 5195 as probably a spiral on several observations and other details were noted.  On 17 Mar 1855: "I have no doubt of a spiral arrangement of the smaller Nucl."  On 16 Apr 1855: "The 2nd Nucl seems to be the proper prolongation of the spiral arm with which it is connected."  On 18 Apr 1860: "I still think the small Nucl is shaped like an "S". On 12 Apr 1872: "The edge of the 2nd convol. is very nearly rectilinear on the south side."

The nickname "Keenan's System" derives from a 1935 paper "An Unusual Pair of Nebulae: NGC 5216 and 5218" (in 1935ApJ....81..355K).  Keenan announced that based on a Yerkes 24-inch plate "these two apparently well-separated galaxies are connected by a faint but definite band of nebulosity... The case is striking, among the small number of pairs known to be physically connected, because of the considerable separation of the two objects in proportion to their size."  The paper included a photograph of the system.  Zwicky used the name "Keenan's System in his 1956 paper "Multiple Galaxies" on interacting galaxies (http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1956ErNW...29..344Z).

V = 7.5;  Size 12.9'x11.5';  Surf Br = 12.8


48" (4/7/13): During this observation of M83, I focused on the HII regions that light up portions of the remarkable spiral arms that emanate from the 3'x1' central bar.  The bar is sharply concentrated with a small, intensely bright, 1' round core.  At the northeast end of the bar a high contrast arm begins to sweep counterclockwise along the east side, ending up directly south of the core.  Several knotty clumps were visible in the region where the arm is attached.  First, at the northeast end of the central bar [1.2' NE of center] is NGC 5236:[dPD83] 42, a 10" HII knot.  This designation is from a 1983 paper by de Vaucouleurs, Pence and Davoust that includes a map of the 60 brightest HII regions.  Close east of this knot is #46, a 20"x10" elongated patch, situated where the arm begins to unfurl to the south [1.7' NE of center].  HII region #54 is another 12" knot a bit further southeast [0.6'] along the arm [1.9' ENE of center].


On the opposite southwest end of the bar a prominent second arm emerges and spirals out counterclockwise along the west side of the galaxy heading north and then spreading out as it curves east.  The arm dims noticeably on the northeast side of the halo near a mag 13 star and has a low surface brightness as it continues south in the outer halo, heading towards h 4599, an 8" pair of mag 8.2/10.7 stars.  Several knots are visible in this arm.  As the arm emerges at the southwest end is #22 and #18, a small 10" knot [1.8' SW of center].  Close north is an elongated clump [2.0' WSW of center], ~25"x10", containing #13 and #15.  Another elongated patch, 30"x10", containing #12 and #16, is 1' further north along the arm [1.9' WNW of center].  Additional HII regions were visible at the northern side of the arm; #39 and #43 are a close pair of small knots ~2.5' NNE of center.  Further east along the arm [3.3' NE of center] is #56, another elongated patch, 20"x10".


A third, wider and more diffuse arm begins on the south side of the bar.  It extends below the brighter arm on the west side, and sweeps more gradually, forming an outer western arm. This arm passes just north of a mag 12 star and ends about 4' W of center at a brighter, elongated patch that includes #2 and #3, as well as a mag 15 star.


48" (5/15/12): jaw-dropping view of M83, with the galaxy filling about 2/3 of the 375x field.  I didn't take detail notes as we were looking for a recently discovered ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), in which a companion star is orbiting a neutron star or black hole.  We found a stellar or quasi-stellar object at the north edge of the central core, but this was likely a compact HII region (the ULX is ~1' E of the nucleus).


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): M83 resembled the photographic appearance in the 24" at 200x.  The bright "bar" was elongated SW-NE and roughly 3'x1' in size with a well-defined bright, round core, 1' in diameter.  The first prominent arm is attached at the northeast end of the bar and sweeps south (counter-clockwise) on the east side of the core, wrapping around the southeast side and spreading out a bit as it terminates to the south of the core (~3' from the center).  This arm has a high contrast along its outer edge and a couple of faint stars or HII knots are visible near where it attaches to the bar.  On the southwest end of the bar a second prominent inner arm emerges and abruptly wraps counter-clockwise around the galaxy on the west side as it heads north.  This arm continues to wrap around the north side before spreading out on the northeast side and merging into the outer halo ~3.5' from center on the northeast edge of the halo. A third, more ill-defined arm, also emerges from the core on the south but sweeps more gently to the west (instead of heading north) on the outside of the second arm.  It spreads out and fades into the general glow about 3.5' SW of center near a superimposed mag 12 star.  Offshoots of the main arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background glow of the halo.


18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): in addition to the complex 3-armed spiral structure I was surprised to see a fairly obvious linear bar that extended through the small, intense core in SW-NE orientation.  The fairly tightly wound spiral arm that wraps from the east side of the core around the south side in a counter-clockwise orientation clearly emerges from the NE end of this bar.  The spiral arms that begin on the south and west side more vaguely emerge from the general glow near the SW end of the bar.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): beautiful view with easy spiral structure in excellent seeing conditions.  The main central portion of the galaxy appears to be in motion, due to the embedded spiral structure and darker ribbons add to this impression.  The three principal arms extending from the galaxy were well seen although they are fairly tightly wound to the main body.


13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): this impressive galaxy was viewed carefully at both 105x and 166x.  The overall size including the spiral arms are ~8'x6'.  The halo is broadly concentrated then rises sharply to an intense 25" core that increases to the center.  Complex spiral structure is quite obvious.  A spiral arm is attached on the east side of the core and wraps around the south side of the galaxy in a counter-clockwise direction.  A second arm is attached at the south side of the core and winds to the west a bit on the south side.  Finally, an arm is attached on the west side and shoots north before gently bending east along the north side of the outer halo.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was my best view to date of M83 with a beautiful spiral structure clearly evident and multiple knotty arms.  Well concentrated with a prominent core and very small nucleus.  A very long, spiral arm is attached on the west side of the central core or bar but quickly bends to the north, becoming more spread out and diffuse.  It continues to wind along the entire east side of the halo and fades out near a close double star, which is the middle of three collinear stars to the SE of the galaxy.  Two other principal arms are visible - one is attached on the following end of the core and heads south, wrapping clockwise around the core towards the west.  A third arm emerges from the core on the west side and winds clockwise towards the north.  Offshoots of the main arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background glow of the halo.


17.5" (5/10/86) : brighter arm or arc visible north of the core.


13.1" (3/24/84): very bright, large, very bright core, brighter along the central "bar".  The shape of the spiral arms and central bar form the Greek letter "Theta" surrounded by a faint halo.


8" (3/24/84): very bright, bright core, elongated, impressive.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered M83 = NGC 5236 = Lac I-6 = D 628 = h3523 in 1751-1752 with only a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He simply described a "small, shapeless" nebula.  M83 is the only galaxy in Lacaille's list and its remarkable that it was discovered with so small an aperture.  Charles Messier was barely able to view it from Paris, noting "It appears as a faint, even light, but is difficult to see with the telescope that the slightest illumination of the micrometer's crosshairs causes it to disappear.  It requires considerable concentration to see at all."


William Herschel made two observations of M83:  On 15 Mar 1787 (sweep 711) he logged "vB, a bright resolvable nucleus in the middle with F branches about 5' or 6' long, E sp-nf."  On 5 May 1793 he logged "vB, a SBN with very extensive and vF nebulosity; it more than fills the field, it seems to be rather stronger from sp to nf. It may be ranked among the nebulous stars."


James Dunlop observed M83 on 29 Apr 1826 and recorded "185 Centauri is a very beautiful round nebula, with an exceedingly bright well-defined disk or nucleus, about 7 or 8 arcseconds diameter, surrounded by a luminous atmosphere or chevelure, about 6' diameter. The nebulous matter is rather a little brighter towards the edge of the planetary disk, but very slightly so. I can see several extremely minute points or stars in the chevelure, but I do not consider them as indications of its being resolvable, although I have no doubt it is composed of stars."  His published position is off by some 12+ minutes in RA, but Glen Cozens found a copying error of exactly 13 minutes from his handwritten position.  His original position is within 10' of center.


John Herschel's first observation from the Cape of Good Hope on 5 May 1834 reads "vB, vL, sbM to a centre equal to a star 9th mag, diam 8", of a resolvable character like a globular cluster, surrounded by an immensely large, extremely dilute almost equable light 7' or 8' diameter, somewhat oval, and passing with excessive suddenness into the central light."


William Lassell discovered the spiral nature using his 48-inch fork-mounted reflector on Malta in May 1862. He sketched M83 as an elegant three-branched spiral (Plate VII, Fig. 28, in Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol 36).  The NGC description "3 branched spiral" refers to Lassell's sketch. It was also sketched by Turner as an elegant "S" shaped spiral on the unpublished Plate VI, figure 62 as well as by Pietro Baracchi in Apr 1885.


M83 has 6 known supernovae, the first (SN 1923A) found by Lampland on a photograph taken 5 May 1923 with the 40-inch Lowell reflector.

14" (4/2/16 - Coonabarabran, 160x): moderately bright, fairly small, irregularly round (seems to change shape with averted vision).  I saw no noticeable core but the galaxy seemed brightest at the west end with careful viewing.  On the DSS, it appears I noticed either a very small companion that's merged on the northwest side or a blue, starburst region of the galaxy.  NGC 5237 forms the southern vertex of an isosceles triangle with two bright stars; mag 7.4 HD 118337 7' NW and mag 7.0 HD 118483 7' NE!  Member of the NGC 5128 (Cen A) group.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5237 = h3524 on 3 Jun 1834 and noted (first of 4 observations) "F; pL; oval; vgbM; 60" l; 50" br."  A sketch was made by Joseph Turner in Jul 1876 using the Great Melbourne Telescope.  MCG fails to label this galaxy as NGC 5237.


This galaxy, along with Fourcade-Figueroa galaxy = ESO 270-017, may have formed from a close interaction between Centaurus A and a spiral galaxy.  A 1992 paper suggest it was ejected as a non-rotating shred of dusty, gas-rich disc material that appears as a blue irregular/starburst dwarf galaxy.

= Not found, Carlson and Corwin.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5242 = h1647 on 10 Apr 1828 and recorded "eF, vL, fills the whole field.  Strongly suspected; yet a doubt remains."  There is nothing near his position (the declination is marked as uncertain) that fits his description and Dorothy Carlson classifies the number as nonexistent.


Harold Corwin concludes "Since there are no galaxies in the area matching JH's description (all are too small), nor are there any one hour preceding or following, or within two +/- degrees of the nominal declination, this may well be a visual illusion of some sort, perhaps caused by scattered light in his telescope."  Curiously, there is an observation by LdR observer R.J. Mitchell on 19 Apr 1855, stating "not L, gbMN and has a patchy look."

At 375x; NGC 5243 exhibited an irregular surface brightness and seemed knotty or dappled with dust. The outer halo appeared to extend further towards the southeast with an occasional slightly brighter knot.


UGC 8564 lies 16.7' WNW.  At 375x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SSW-NNE, 45"x18", small bright nucleus, moderately high surface brightness (central region of galaxy viewed).

The Fourcade-Figueroa Galaxy = ESO 270-017 (possible remnant or "shard", resulting from a close interaction between Centaurus A and a spiral galaxy), lies 45' NW.  I was pleased to make a definite sighting as an extremely faint, very elongated glow, particularly extending east-southeast of a mag 11 star.  The very low surface brightness glow was "pointing" just south of a mag 9 star (HD 118087), which is 8' ESE of the mag 11 star (roughly the center of the Fourcade-Figueroa System), and extended at least 2'x 0.4'.  A short extension on the west-northwest side of the star was difficult to confirm but was marginally  glimpsed.  The mag 11 near the center forms the northeast vertex of a small quadrilateral (sides 1.2' or less) of mag 10.5, 12.5 and 13 stars.  The faintest star is superimposed on west-northwest extension of the galaxy.

48" (5/14/12): I was amazed at the beauty of this face-on spiral with two well-defined spiral arms containing numerous HII knots and a third faint arm!  The galaxy is sharply concentrated with an extremely bright round core, ~30" diameter.  The slightly brighter and longer southern arm was attached at the north end of the core and winded gracefully counterclockwise for nearly 270°, terminating on the WSW side of the galaxy, 2.4' from center.  The arm displayed a high-contrast and was relatively narrow and sharply defined.  It contained two knots and brighter segments.  It broadened slightly as it unwound on the south side and appeared slightly mottled. The brightest HII knot was 10" in diameter and situated slightly further out, 1.9' SW of center.  Beyond this point, the last portion of the arm dimmed and ended at another 8" knot at the tip, 2.4' WSW of center.  The northern arm is attached on the south side of the core and winds counterclockwise to the north, though only curves gently.  A fairly bright knot (possibly double) is situated along this arm 1.4' NNW of center.  Another fainter knot is at the north tip of the arm, 1.8' from center.  A third, vaguely defined arm emerges to the south of the core and unwinds counterclockwise to the west.  A mag 16.5 star marks the tip of this arm.


17.5" (5/30/92): moderately bright, large, slightly elongated 4:3 SW-NE, about 4'x3', sharp concentration with a very weakly concentrated halo which fades into the background.  Unusual appearance as suddenly rises to very small bright core 20"-30" diameter.  Spiral structure not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5247 = H II-297 = h1649 on 7 Feb 1785 (sweep 369) and logged "pF, L, mbM."  A later observation on 7 Feb 1787 (sweep 732) reads "pB, vL, the greatest part of it vF, unequally bright almost like two joined, the smaller being north preceding [perhaps a spiral arm?]."  On sweep 354, John Herschel recorded "vF; vL; psb to a brighter kind of nebula; a good type of its class.  It loses itself quite imperceptibly.  Diam of the faint neb = 2'; of the brighter part or nucl = 10 or 15". (See fig 39.)".


William Lassell observed this galaxy with his 48-inch from Malta on 20 May 1862 and called it "a very faint spiral Nebula".  His sketch (Plate VII, Fig. 29, in Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol 36) shows a graceful S-shaped spiral with two long arms opening widely from a small nucleus.  The NGC description "2 branched spiral" refers to Lassell's sketch. Joseph Turner observed it on 8 May 1878 with the 48-inch Great Melbourne Telescope with a 6-day moon in the sky and noted mottling, but no spiral structure.

48" (5/15/12): beautiful two-armed spiral, very large, elongated ~3:2 SW-NE.  The brightest portion is ~3.8'x2.5' but the faint, outer spiral arms increase the diameter to at least 5'. The galaxy is sharply concentrated with an intense oval core.  The brighter spiral arm begins to the north of the core, wrapping counterclockwise around the east and southeast side and it is lit up by several fairly prominent knots.  The arm dims fairly abruptly on the southeast side but continues unwrapping to the south, extending outside and just beyond a mag 13.5-14 star 1.7' SSW of center.  A mag 15.3 star is 0.6' N of center, just outside where the arm emerges on the north side.


At least four distinct HII knots are in or near this arm, along with brighter segments.  The following designations are from the 1983 Hodge-Kennicutt "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  A faint knot, [HK 83] 26/28 is between the mag 15.3 star and the core.  The arm brightens along the east side of the core and include the faint knots [HK 83] 13/15, 28" NE of center, and [HK 83] 5/6 1.0' ESE of center.  The most prominent knot along with this arm is [HK 83] 9, 1.2' SE of center.


The western spiral arm (not traced directly to the core) stretches to the north and also contains several knots (HII complexes/star associations).  The first knot is [HK 83] 63, 0.8' W of center.  A large brighter knot or arc ~1.1' NW of center includes [HK 83] 74/77/81.  A faint knot, [HK 83] 66/71, is near the tip of this arm 1.5' NNW of center.  A similar knot, [HK 83] 53, is 25" SE, on line with the core.


24" (5/24/20): at 225x, 260x and 375x; beautiful two-armed spiral elongated NW-SE, sharply concentrated with a very bright oval core that appeared mottled and a small brighter nucleus. A fairly well defined spiral arm was attached on the NE side, near an easy mag 15.3 star 0.7' N of center.  It curved clockwise along the east side and appeared somewhat diffuse, blending into the glow of the disc on the interior and exterior sides.  It terminated at a very diffuse HII patch ([HK 83] #9), 1.2' SE of center.


The western arm had a higher surface brightness with a very sharply defined outer edge and a mottled or uneven appearance.  It was easily traced at 225x and 375x with the brightest part detached from the core and extended almost due north, terminating 1.5' NW of center.  Both arms were immersed in the haze of the disc ~3.5'x2.5'. A mag 13.7 star is 1.7' S, just outside the halo.


18" (6/7/08): bright, large, elongated NW-SE, 3.5'x2.4', sharply concentrated with a very bright, round 25" core.  At 200x, two spiral arms extend out from the central region.  The brightest and longest arm is attached at the west side of the core and gradually sweeps to the north.  A couple of very faint, very small knots are embedded in this arm including one due west of the core.  On the east end of the core a matching arm is attached that curves a bit more as it swings towards the south in a counter-clockwise orientation.  A faint star is just north of the central region and a brighter star is 1.7' S of center.


17.5" (5/30/92): bright, large, slightly elongated WNW-ESE, 4'x3', well-defined small very bright core, almost stellar nucleus.  A mag 13 star lies 1.7' SSW of center and a mag 15 star is embedded at the north edge of the halo.  Appears slightly mottled or dusty but spiral arms were not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5248 = H I-34 = h1650 on 15 Apr 1784 (sweep 194) and recorded "vB, nearly R and cometic but the nucleus is large and seems to consist of bright close stars, resolvable."  On 1 May 1786 (sweep 560) he logged "vB, cL, E from np to sf, a small bright nucleus."


R.J. Mitchell, observing on 19 Apr 1855 with LdR's 72", logged "Large and pretty bright, Bright nucleus. Seen as in sketch, but not certain whether the lower branch joins the nucleus or is only the continuation of the upper curve."  On 29 March 1856 he recorded "The preceding arm does appear to originate from the nucleus, which is very bright and oval shaped."   The two brightest spiral arms as well as the brightest HII knot at the southeast end of the eastern arm, are clearly shown on Plate XXVIII, fig 29 in PT 1861

This is the third most southerly object discovered by WH and only reached an altitude of 7° on the meridian.  James Dunlop observed this galaxy on 7 May 1826 and described "a very small and very bright nebula, very much resembling a small star, surrounded by a very strong burr; this is a singular body."

This galaxy was not observed by JH nor found by Bigourdan.  The GC and NGC position is a mean of sweep 924 and 926 and is 16 sec of RA too large.

48" (5/10/18): at 488x; fairly bright or bright, roundisht, very strong concentration with two easily visible nucleus separated by 10".  The brighter (north-northeast) core is ~8"-10" with a sharp stellar nucleus.  The fainter (south-southwest) core is 6"-8" diameter. The outer halo has a low surface brightness.  HJ 2667, a 14" pair of mag 11 stars, lies 5.6' WSW.  MCG +08-25-030, situated 1' SE of this pair, appeared moderately bright, elongated ~2:1 NW-SE, ~20"x10".


24" (6/4/16): at 322x; fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, 40"x30", brighter ill-defined core, uneven surface brightness.  Occasionally, a brighter quasi-stellar knot (nucleus of the merged companion) would pop on the northeast end of the glow [the nuclei are separated by just 10"!].  HJ 2667, a wide pair (14") of mag 11 stars, lies 5.6' WSW.


17.5" (5/11/02): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 0.8'x0.6', irregular surface brightness.  A mag 15 star is 1.0' NW of center.  Located 5.5' ENE of an evenly matched pair (HJ 2667) of mag 11 stars at 14" separation.


This is a well-studied merging system consisting of a Seyfert 2 and a LINER galaxy with the compact nuclei separated by just 10" [physical separation ~15,000 l.y.].

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; the view under subpar conditions in the 82" was similar to the view 3 years ago in Jimi's 48".  The most striking feature are two thin bright spiral arms that appear as very bright arcs, like two parentheses enclosing the fainter central region.  A diffuse tidal arm extends from the north side to the NE and nearly reaches a mag 15 star.  On the SW side a very low surface brightness "bridge" connects NGC 5257 with NGC 5258.


48" (5/4/16): at 610x; very bright, fairly large, striking two armed-spiral.  The central portion only extends ~35", but contains a fascinating structure.  Along the southwest and northeast flanks are sharp-edged prominent "arms", appearing as thin, high surface brightness arcs, with the southern arc slightly brighter.  Both "arms" are slightly convex, appearing like a close pair of parenthesis enclosing the central region!  The northern arm continues as a fainter, but easily visible, fairly thin arc extending west-northwest, and ends just before reaching a mag 15 star [1.7' WNW of center].  A thin, very low surface brightness arm extends west from the southern "parenthesis" towards NGC 5258 (1.4' ESE), but stops just short.  The tip-to-tip distance between the two arms is ~1.6'.


On the inside of the two bright "arcs" (blue star-forming arms) there appear to be two thin dust lanes as the surface brightness drops dramatically.  At the center is a fairly faint stellar nucleus.  The overall appearance is very unusual as the surface brightness of the core region is lower than the thin pair of symmetrical arms.


17.5" (4/28/90): fairly faint, fairly small, oval 3:2 WSW-ENE, weak concentration.  A mag 14 star is off the west side 1.7' from the center.  Forms a close, interacting pair (Arp 240) with NGC 5258 1.3' SE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5257 = H II-895 = h1654, along with NGC 5258, on 13 May 1793 (sweep 1044) and noted "F, S, iR."  JH made the single observation "The first of 2 comprising a double nebula; both vF; R; bM.  The smaller of the two."

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; NGC 5258 is the eastern member of a dramatic interacting pair (Arp 240 = VV 55) with NGC 5257 directly west.  The two galaxies are connected by a very low surface brightness bridge that spans the eastern spiral arm in NGC 5257 and the western arm in NGC 5258.  NGC 5258 was strongly concentrated with a bright, mottled core.  There was a bright region in the spiral arm to the north of the core, midway to a mag 15.5 star.  An obvious spiral arm swept east from the south side of the galaxy. The northern arm is much less evident, mainly just south and west of the mag 15.5 star, but immediately dims into a very low surface brightness bridge stretching to the NGC 5257.


48" (5/4/16): at 610x; bright, fairly large, two-armed spiral that is interacting with NGC 5257.  The main body is elongated 3:1 SSW-NNE, 1.1'x0.35', and is well concentrated with a fairly small, roundish, brighter core.  A mag 15.5 star is at the NNW edge and an apparent HII region is visible midway between the core and this star, along the major axis.  A strong spiral arm is easy visible attached to the southwest end.  It hooks sharply to the east and gradually fades, stretching 40"-45" E.  A dim shorter arm is attached on the northeast end and curls west near the mag 15.5 star, extending perhaps 20" in the direction of NGC 5257.


17.5" (4/28/90): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SSW-NNE, brighter along the major axis.  Located 4.2' NW of mag 9.5 SAO 120058.  NGC 5258 has a slightly higher surface brightness than its close companion NGC 5257, just 1.5' WNW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5258 = H II-896 = h1655, along with NGC 5257, on 13 May 1793 (sweep 1044) and noted "F, S, iR."  JH called it the larger of the pair, but both were "vF; R; bM."


On 24 Apr 1857, R.J. Mitchell (LdR's assistant), recorded "the p one [NGC 5257] is slightly oval in form and the f one [NGC 5258] is mE nearly north-south and has a star at n end.  Both look very resolvable.  No nuclei, not vF."  A sketch made on 26 Apr 1878, shows NGC 5258 as having an irregular shape (like a flying bat) and concave to the east.

This is an interacting (Arp 239 = VV 19) one-armed spiral with a diffuse bridge to NGC 5279 0.6' ENE of center.  The single arm wraps tightly around the south side to the west and then separates on the north side.  There was a brightening along the south edge that gave the impression of an arm, though it hugged the core too tightly to be resolved.  But starting on the west side a straight spiral arm was evident extending NE.  The arm dimmed suddenly into low surface brightness haze that extended further east to the north side of NGC 5279, merging with its northern spiral arm.  The pair is located 8' SW of mag 6.9 HD 119549.


MCG +09-22-094, located 2.8' WNW, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, very thin edge-on ~6:1 N-S, ~0.6'x0.1', low even surface brightness.

UGC 8671, located 2.7' SW, appeared bright, fairly small, slightly elongated ~E-W, sharply concentrated with an intensely bright core!

AGC 1783, with up to 18 ultra-dim IC members observed by Barnard and Burnham, is ~15' ESE.


24" (6/21/20): at 375x; moderately bright, fairly small, oval 4:3 WSW-ENE, ~36"x27", brighter elongated core. I saw of hint of the spiral arm on the north side, but no indication of the bridge connecting to NGC 5279.


UGC 8671, located 2.7' SW, was dominated by a 13th magnitude quasi-stellar nucleus.  The halo was barely detected as a very diffuse, low surface brightness glow mainly west of the nucleus.


18" (4/26/08): fairly faint, small, irregularly round, 30"x25", weak concentration with a slightly brighter core.  The surface appears slightly irregular or mottled.  This is the brighter southwestern member of an interacting double system (Arp 239) with NGC 5279, barely off the east end.  A mag 6.9 star lies 8' ENE, but it was easy to keep it out of the field.


17.5" (6/18/93): fairly faint, fairly small, round, 45" diameter, very weakly concentrated core.  Forms a double system with NGC 5279 just off the ENE edge 40" between centers.  A mag 13.5 star lies 1.7' NNW.  Located 8.1' WSW of mag 6.9 SAO 28858.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5278 = H II-798 = h1665 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921) and noted "pB, E, 1 1/2' long and 1/2' br."  His position is 2' northwest of this double system.  JH resolved it and recorded "vF; double neb; pos = 73° by microm; a large star follows dist = 15' +/-."  The field was sketched on 9 Apr 1874 at Birr Castle and a "star" labeled "epsilon" actually corresponds with UGC 8671.

Spiral structure evident with an arm faintly visible on the east side extending north and merging into the dim tidal bridge to the north side of NGC 5279.  The tidal bridge was seen as low surface brightness haze connecting to an easy spiral arm on the north side of NGC 5278.


24" (6/21/20): at 375x: fairly faint, small, round, 15"-20" diameter, stellar nucleus.  Fainter component of an interacting pair (Arp 239) with NGC 5278 [36" between centers].


18" (4/26/08): faint, very small, round, 12" diameter, too small for any other details.  Just resolved off the ENE end of NGC 5278 (35" between centers).  This is an M51-type interacting pair (Arp 239), though there was no sign of the connecting arm.


17.5" (6/18/93): very faint, very small, round, 20" diameter, even surface brightness.  Located just off the east edge of larger and brighter NGC 5278.  On photos NGC 5279 appears to be embedded at the end of a spiral arm of NGC 5278.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5279 = h1665a on 4 May 1831 and described a "vF; double neb; pos = 73° by micrometer."  WH discovered the brighter southwestern component on 14 Apr 1789.  JH only included only a single entry in the GC (3639), though described this system as a double or bi-nuclear.


Lawrence Parsons (the 4th Earl of Rosse) resolved the pair again on 2 May 1872 and noted a "D neb, sp one B, pos 71.8°, dist 39".  In the NGC, Dreyer equated NGC 5279 with h1665a and listed LdR* (Lawrence Parsons) in the "Other Observers" column to acknowledge JH's prior discovery.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 178x): very bright, striking cluster including a 2' string containing (from southwest to northeast) four stars mag 8.4, 7.9, 8.5 and 6.6 (at the northeast end).  A 2' linear chain of 7 mag 10-11 stars intersects these bright stars.  The central 4'-5' region contains ~50 stars, but many stars are scattered outside this region, extending the size of roughly 10'.  NGC 5269 (probably an asterism) lies 12.5' W.


18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this large, rich cluster is striking at 128x.  A curving 2' string of four stars mag 6.6-8.6 oriented SW-NE dominate the view, with a pale yellow star and an orange star at opposite ends adding color.  Overall, perhaps 150 stars are visible (many mag 11-12) in an irregular 10' region although the boundaries are arbitrary as the cluster blends into the surrounding fields.  Most of the brighter stars are within a 3' region and in fact the catalogued diameter is only 5'.  At 228x, another fainter layer of 15th magnitude stars emerged from the background.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 5281 = Lac I-7 = D 273 = h3531 in 1751-1752 during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  With a 1/2" telescope at 8x he noted a "small indistinct spot."  James Dunlop described D 273 as "a curved line of small stars, about 1.5' long, with a star of the 7th mag in the north extremity; a group of extremely minute stars on the preceding side of the crescent, and a multitude of very minute stars extended preceding and following."  Dunlop sketched the cluster (Fig. 11) and observed it 7 times.  John Herschel called it (sweep 596) "a brilliant, compact, milky way cluster.  Rich; irreg fig; gbM; 10' stars 10, 11 and 12m."

18" (10/16/17 - OzSky): at 79x (62' field); this large Milky Way field (demonstrated to be a random collection of stars) is located ~25' ENE of a wide, bright double star (DUN 142 = 6.5/7.6 at 33").  It roughly extends 25' in diameter and appears rectangular in outline, though is not detached in the wider field.  The group contains a large number of mag 11.5-13 stars.  A fairly well defined 20' string of stars oriented NW-SE appears to define the southern boundary and runs along the line from DUN 142 and mag 7.3 HD 120042 to the southeast.  The 25' region to the north of this string contains scores of visible stars but too difficult to count.  NGC 5284 was not impressive or stood out though was somewhat richer than the region directly to the east.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5284 = h3532 on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded a "Cl class VIII; L; v rich; loosely sc; stars 7,8,...16m; it is an outlier of the milky way, but very rich and insulated."  His position corresponds with the brightest mag 9 star.

At 200x, 15-25 14th magnitude stars popped in an out of view (some in chains), though only a handful were easily resolved, including a brighter star just east of the core.  NGC 5286 is located 4' NW of yellow 4.7-magnitude M Centauri in the same high power field!  It was easily visible in the 9x50 finder, though small.  NGC 5307, a fairly bright planetary, lies 44' ENE.

On the verge of resolution although viewed at only 8° elevation.  Mag 4.7 M Centauri with a mag 11 companion at 40" separation is located just 4.1' SE of the core!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5286 = D 388 = h3533 on 29 Apr 1826 with his 9-inch reflector and described "a bright exceedingly well-defined rather elliptical nebula, about 1' diameter, exceedingly condensed almost to the very edge, and gradually a little brighter to the centre. This is about 6' north of M Centauri - I have a strong suspicion that this is resolvable into stars."  His position is 4.7' northeast of center.

John Herschel observed it on two sweeps, recording on 31 Mar 1835 "very bright; gradually much brighter to the middle; 2.5' or 3' diameter; resolved into 15th mag stars; has one star 12th mag S.f.; the centre near the edge. It is in the field with Brisbane 4618 a star of 6th mag."

I contacted Harold Corwin by e-mail and suggested h3538 = ESO 445-035, but his analysis showed that Herschel's other positions on the sweep were all reasonably close, and a simpler explanation is a 30 tsec error for NGC 5302 only.  So, NGC 5298 = ESO 445-039.  See Corwin's notes.

13 50 32 -60 26 18; Cen

Size 22'


14" (4/5/16 - Coonabarabran, 73x): the most noticeable grouping is a large, scattered Milky Way field with ~150 stars in a 12' region.  The brightest star is the variable VX Centauri, at 9th magnitude.  Just off the northwest side is a distinctive 2.5' string of 4 stars (three of these are mag 10.5) oriented NW-SE.   A few arcmin west of the main group is another detached collection (most in an elongated N-S stream, along with several more in a smaller N-S string further west).  The N-S group includes a mag 9.8 star and the smaller string includes mag 9.2 HD 120131 on the south end.  Combining the various subgroups together produces a 20' Milky Way field that stands out reasonably well.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5299 = h3537 on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded a "Cl VII class, much more than fill field, a very L and rich milky way cl, quite insulated on the preceding, north, and following sides and nearly so to the south, forming a king of peninsular projection, but much richer than the main portion of the milky way."


At his CGH position is a bright Milky Way field with a diameter of  ~30'.  Harold Corwin notes "there is a +30 arcmin error in the GC and NGC declination (too far north)."   RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, small, blue-green oval, ~15"x10".  This unusual planetary has an irregular, wispy surface brightness with fascinating glimpses of structure at 293x and 428x.  It appears brighter along the major axis, particularly at the south end with a couple of small, darker areas or regions where the nebulosity is weaker on the sides.  A trio of mag 13-14 stars to the southeast is collinear with the planetary.  Situated in a fairly rich star field.


10" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 214x and UHC filter, this small, fairly bright planetary appeared as a slightly elongated disc, ~13"x10" in diameter with a high, fairly even surface brightness except for a weak brightening at the center, but no definite central star.  Set in a rich star field 45' ENE of globular NGC 5286 and mag 4.7 M Centauri.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5307 = h3541 on 15 Apr 1836 and recorded "A very singular object. At first I thought it an ill seen double star; 12..13 = 12..13 mag; distance 2"; but not being able to get it into focus I applied 320 power; which showed it as a hazy, rather elongated, planetary nebulous disc, as if a double star all but obliterated. It is positively not a star. The field is full of stars, two of which are equal to this object in light, but 320 shows them both quite sharp. It is a difficult object to find, and unless in a good night for definition (this is superb) it could not be recovered. The place is well taken. It is the smallest and most difficult planetary nebula I have ever seen.  Figure 15, plate VI, exhibits its appearance with power 320  (N.B. By this figure it would seem rather to belong to the class of double nebulae or double stellar nebulae of the utmost remoteness, than to that of planetary nebulae, properly so called.)"


Joseph Turner observed and sketched the planetary on 23 Jul 1875 with the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished Plate VII, figure 70).  He noted a "bluish tinge" and commented that Herschel's sketch showed it as a double nebula (two condensations), but he couldn't see a duplex character, although it was elongated N-S (Herschel sketched it NW-SE).

Several sources misidentify MCG +06-30-095 as NGC 5319.  The sketch made with Lord Rosse's 72" clearly shows MCG +06-30-095 and NGC 5319 (3.5' NNE of NGC 5318), but MCG +06-30-095 did not receive a NGC designation as Dreyer may have felt it was part of NGC 5318.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 5319 on 27 Mar 1856 at Birr Castle, while observing NGC 5318.  He labeled this galaxy "C" on the field sketch and simply noted "vF".  Although no separations were estimated, the sketch is accurate enough to identify NGC 5319 = PGC 84061.  See NGC 5318 for more on this sketch.


The RNGC and Uranometria Deep Sky Field Guide misidentify MCG +06-30-095 (1.9' NNW of NGC 5318) as NGC 5319.  Corwin agrees that NGC 5319 = PGC 84061.  Malcolm Thomson disagrees and identifies a faint galaxy 5.2' NNW of NGC 5318 as NGC 5319.  See Harold Corwin's NGC identification notes.

18" (5/16/09): fairly faint, small, round, 24" diameter, weak concentration though with direct vision a faint quasi-stellar nucleus was visible.  Located 4.5' SSE of NGC 5318 and 11' E of NGC 5312.


17.5" (5/22/93): faint, very small, round.  Two faint mag 14.5-15 stars are close west [mag 14.5 1.2' WSW] and two mag 11 stars are 3.6' W and 3.8' SW.  NGC 5318 lies 4' NNW and NGC 5312 11' W.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5321 = H III-423 = h1680 on 2 May 1785 (sweep 406) and recorded "Two, eF, stellar, the time and number taken between them.  The northern one is the faintest; distance about 4 or 5' not far from the meridian."  His single position is 2' southwest of NGC 5321 = CGCG 190-065 and his description is an excellent fit with NGC 5318 and NGC 5321, which are separated by 4.6' in position angle 160° (NNW-SSE).  The only discrepancy is the northern object (NGC 5318) is brighter.


JH made two observations (one good position), calling it "eF; at first sight like a *, but on long attention a pL neb surrounds it" on sweep 337 and "pB; R; smbM." on sweep 74.  But he assumed this object was new and his father's III-422 applied to NGC 5312 = h1676.  As a result, JH is credited with the discovery of NGC 5321 in the GC and NGC.  But NGC 5312 is over 10' southwest of NGC 5318 and the orientation doesn't match WH's description ("not far from the meridian").  Reassigning the historical designations based on this analysis, results in h1676 = GC 3664 = NGC 5312, III-422 = h1679 = GC 3668 = NGC 5318 and III-423 = h1680 = GC 3670 = NGC 5321.

The southern component (VV 253a) appeared moderately bright and large, elongated NW-SE but with an irregular outline.  Contains a brighter elongated core with a faint stellar nucleus.  The galaxy thins on the southeast end with a faint extension or tail, creating an asymmetric appearance.  The northern galaxy (VV 253b) appeared fairly bright or bright, moderately large, oval 2:1 SW-NE, irregular outline.  Contains a high surface brightness elongated core with a stellar nucleus.


CGCG 017-081, situated 1.3' W of the pair, appeared fairly faint, small, round, 15" diameter, a 17th mag star is 15" WSW.  A 16th magnitude star lies midway between the CGCG and the NGC pair.


48" (5/4/16): at 697x; NGC 5531 is a fascinating interacting pair (25" between centers) with a third component (CGCG 017-081) 1.3' W.  The northern component (VV 253b = PGC 49266) is fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 2:1 or 5:2 SW-NE, 30"x12", sharply concentrated with a prominent, elongated core and bright stellar nucleus.  The surface brightness of the halo is irregular with a hint of spiral structure.


The southern galaxy (highly disrupted on the SDSS with a tidal plume to the WNW) is fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 3:1 NW-SE, broad concentration but no well defined zones.  The surface brightness, though, is irregular or mottled and the galaxy appears dusty. More unusual is the shape; the galaxy tapers at the southeast east and the northwest end bends or twists towards the northern spiral, creating a kidney-bean outline.


CGCG 017-081, 1.3' W, appeared fairly faint, small, round, 15" diameter, nearly even surface brightness.  A mag 16.5 star is just 14" WSW of center.  A mag 16 star sits midway between this galaxy and the NGC 5331 pair.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x I immediately noticed a 15' irregular chain of two dozen stars, roughly forming the outline of an animal - approximating a dog or horse.  Within the position of the "head" of this figure is a pair of equal mag 10.5 stars at 11" separation.  In fact, many of the brighter stars are 10th-11th magnitude.  This chain is well detached in the field so it stands out well, although there are no dense spots and this loose group appears to be an asterism.  Upping the magnification to 228x, at least 80 stars are visible within a 15' region.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

18" (3/29/03): at 450x this fairly large, oval galaxy has a mottled appearance.  The bright stellar nucleus appears like a bright superimposed star (images confirm a star very near the center) surrounded by a bright core.  Located 3.8' SW of SAO 120182 = STT 273, an 8.4/8.9 pair at just 1.0" that was resolved at this power.

8" (5/21/82): bright, small, round, small bright nucleus.  A mag 8 star is 4' E.  NGC 5364 lies 14' S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5363 = H I-6 = h1703 on 19 Jan 1784 (sweep 89) and recorded "a pL nebula, not cometic.  It seems resolvable, but I have no apparatus at hand for applying high powers."  On 12 May 1793 he noted "vB, cL, BN."

48" (3/1/19): at 488x; very bright, very large, oval 3:2 SW-NE, ~4.5'x3.0'.  Strongly concentrated with a bright 1.5'x1.0' oval core that increased to a small bright nucleus with direct vision.  There was a strong suggestion of spiral structure (arcs) in the large halo, but the contrast was too low to trace the arms.  Two mag 14.2/14.4 stars are at the edge of the halo on the NW side and form the base of a thin isosceles triangle with the nucleus.  Although the core region was well defined, it didn't appear as a ring.


17.5" (4/28/90): moderately bright, large, broad weak concentration, elongated SW-NE.  Two mag 14 stars are 1.6' NW of center.  Forms a pair with NGC 5360 8' WSW and NGC 5363 lies 14.5' N.  Sixth of seven in the NGC 5363 group.


8" (5/21/82): faint, large, diffuse glow.  Forms an unusual pair with smaller but brighter NGC 5363 14' N.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5364 = H II-534 = h1705 on 2 Feb 1786 (sweep 521) and recorded "pB, vL, gbM."


Bindon Stoney found it again on 14 Apr 1852 at Birr Castle and assumed it to be new, so John Herschel catalogued it also as GC 3703.  Dreyer combined the two GC entries in the NGC.  Harold Corwin suggests that JH's observation of h1678 (later NGC 5317), which he assumed to be new, may be a duplicate observation with a 5 minute error in RA.

Several of these stars form a semicircle cradling the galaxy.  Located 53' NNW of mag 3.9 Upsilon 1 Centauri.


NGC 5365B is 9' ESE and NGC 5365A is 13.5' SW. NGC 5365B is a fairly faint, thin edge-on SW-NE, 0.8'x0.2'.  NGC 5365A is also a fairly faint edge-on E-W, 1.5'x0.25'.  A mag 12 star is at the east edge.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5365 = h3547 on 15 Mar 1836 and recorded "pB; vS; R; gbM; 15"."  His mean position (two sweeps) is accurate.  While observing NGC 5365 on 18 May 1881 with the 48" Melbourne telescope, Joseph Turner discovered NGC 5365A.  The discovery was not published, so it didn't receive a NGC designation.

Size 4'x3'


18" (4/1/19 - OzSky): at 182x; large, bright reflection nebula surrounding a close pair (4") of mag 10/10.5 stars, perhaps 3' diameter.  A small detached halo also surrounds a mag 12 star 2.4' N.


ESO 326-042, located 19' ESE, appeared fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 5:1 NW-SE, ~1.1'x0.2', smooth even surface brightness.  Located 3.4' NNE of mag 7.9 HD 121912 in a rich Centaurus star field.


18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this prominent reflection nebula appears as 2.5' round glow surrounding a delicate pair of mag 10/10.5 stars at 4" separation (HJ 4636).  The nebulosity has a uniform, fairly high surface brightness.  About 2' N and 1.5' NE are a wide pair of mag 12/13 stars.  The star situated 2' N illuminates a small detached piece of nebulosity.  Deep images reveal this nebula is the head of a one degree faint tail (cometary globule CG 12) that streams to the southeast.


17.5" (5/4/02): this unusual reflection nebula surrounds a bright, close pair of mag 10.3/10.7 stars at 4" (h4636).  The nebula appeared as a round, fairly faint, 3' glow surrounding the illuminating stars.  Although the elevation was only 10° at the time of the observation, the hazy glow was pretty evident.  A brighter mag 9 star lies 4' ENE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5367 = h3548 on 26 Jun 1834 and recorded "a close double star in a vL, B, luminous atmosphere, 2' diameter. The star A which is quite as bright, has no such atmosphere. The atmosphere is vlbM. The star was not noticed as double till too late for a good measure after I showed the object to my attendant J.S [John Stone]., verified with 240x and 320x. A furious hot north wind, but the definition of stars excellent. It is no illusion, other stars are sharp and brilliant, and have not the least nebulous appearance."  Sketch Plate VI, figure 10.


Joseph Turner had a difficult time identifying NGC 5367 on two nights, including 1 Jul 1875, as he was expecting a fairly bright object.  He wrote in his logbook, "It is now so very very faint that it only against a clear black sky it can be seen at all...Herschel's drawing [shows] the double star being in the center of the nebula, while at present the star is near the northeast extremity."  Images show the nebulosity is brighter and more extensive to the west and southwest of the star.  Turner also commented "It must surely have diminished in brightness since H's time, as I cannot imagine that an 18 inch telescope could show it at present, it is so very faint."


Lewis Swift rediscovered this reflection nebula on 30 Dec 1897, assumed it was new (despite JH's good position) and described Sw. XI-162 (later IC 4347) as "8m * in center of eeeF nebulosity".  He added the note "This is a perfect speciment of a nebulous star, and the only one I have ever found, and a beautiful one it is."  Swift included this object in a short article in the 1902 Popular Astronomy titled "Remarkable Nebulae".  He noted, "this is a beautiful nebulous star of the 8th mag exactly in the center of a nebulous atmosphere, whose outlines are a sharp as the planet Jupiter."  Both Swift and Dreyer missed that IC 4347 = NGC 5367, despite the similar positions and descriptions.


The nebulosity was included in the Catalogue of Bright Nebulosities in Opaque Dust Clouds by Bernes as No. 147. He described it as a reflection nebula 4' x 3' (measured north-south by east-west), appearing very bright on the blue plate. He noted the nebulosity is located on the edge of the cometary globular CG 12, which measures 20'x8'.

The core isn't elongated in the direction of the bar, though, but angles WSW-ENE towards an 8" pair of mag 14 stars 1.1' from center.  The central bar is oriented NW-SE and extends ~1.5' x 0.4'.  At both ends of the bar are relatively large, bright knots (regions of enhanced star formation), ~18" diameter.  A fairly thin, striking "wing" (spiral arm) extends ~0.7' SW from the SE end of the bar, forming a sharp right angle.  A less distinct and shorter arm angles NE from the NW end of the bar, completing the "Z" with a "stroke" (core) outline.   A low surface brightness, roundish halo, encompasses the striking shape.  Two mag 16-16.5 stars are superimposed north of the core.  Member of the NGC 5353/5371 Group (LGG 363/361).


UGC 8877, a very low surface brightness dwarf, lies 3' S.  At 610x it appeared faint, fairly large, low even surface brightness.  This face-on barred spiral didn't display any structure due to an anemic surface brightness. A mag 10.8 star is 2' ENE.


17.5" (5/27/95): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 4:3 NW-SE, 2.5'x2.0'.  Contains a prominent bright core about 45"x30" elongated E-W (bar) with the fainter halo tilted 45° with respect to the core.  A close pair of mag 14 stars at 8" separation is at the east edge 1.1' from center.  Located near the midpoint of mag 10.5 and 12 stars 3' SE and NW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5383 = H I-181 = h1717 on 9 Apr 1787 (sweep 725) and recorded "cB, cL, mbM."  JH made the single observation "not vB; R; gbM; 40"." and measured an accurate position.

17.5" (5/23/98): this group consists of 11 similar mag 11.5-12.5 stars in a 7'x3' field elongated NW-SE and a couple of much fainter stars.  The grouping is unconcentrated and the stars are pretty evenly distributed with no close pairs.  Radial velocities show this group is an asterism and not a true cluster, although it stands out reasonably well at low power.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5385 = h1721 on 5 May 1831 and reported "A cluster of 11 stars 11m, and 2 of 15m."  His position corresponds with a mag 11 star at the center of this asterism.  Villanova (2004, A&A, 428, 67) conclude this is a random enhancement of field stars and not a cluster based  on the random radial velocities (no common motion) of the stars.  RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent (Type 7).

48" (4/1/11): the Heron Galaxy was a remarkable interacting pair at 375x and 488x.  The main galaxy (NGC 5395) was extremely bright, elongated 5:2 N-S, 2.5'x1.1', contains a blazing 30" core and a mottled, clumpy appearance.  The most prominent feature is a well-defined, long arm that begins to the north of the core and wraps all the way around the core.  This arm shoots past the core just to its east and heads directly south. The knotty arm then tightly curves back around towards the north on the west side, extending the full length of the galaxy and angling slightly towards smaller NGC 5395.  A dark lane separates the core region from the arm on the west side.  An irregular extension (or part of an arm) branches north from the main arm on the north side of the core and culminates at a brighter region or knot at the north end of the galaxy.  NGC 5394 is 1.9' NW of center and one of the arms of this galaxy attaches to NGC 5395 on the NW side.


18" (5/3/08): at 280x appeared fairly bright, very elongated ~3:1 N-S, 1.7'x0.5', brighter 25"x20" core, irregular appearance with a brighter knot or extension on the NW side.  Forms a close, interacting pair with NGC 5394 1.8' NNW.  A very faint extension or haze is off the west side (this is an "arm" that interacts with NGC 5394).  Several faint stars are near including a mag 13.5 1.7' S of center, a mag 15 star 1.9' N of center and another mag 15 star ~1.5' WNW of center.  IC 4356 lies 4' NNW.


18" (4/26/08): this is the brighter and larger member of an interesting interacting pair with NGC 5394.  Appears fairly bright, very elongated 3:1 N-S, 1.5'x0.5', broad concentration with a brighter core.  The galaxy has a mottled, irregular surface with a slightly brighter linear streak is on the NE end with the impression of a very faint, round knot on the north end.  An extremely faint hazy extension was highly suspected on the west side in the direction of NGC 5394 located 1.8' NNW of center.  A mag 13.5 star is off the south end.


17.5" (6/6/86): fairly bright, elongated NNW-SSE, bright core, small bright nucleus.  A mag 13.5 star is off the south edge 1.7' from center.  There is an impression of a dark lane on the west side and an extremely faint arm beyond the lane (agrees with POSS).  Forms a contact system with NGC 5394 at the NNW edge!


William Herschel discovered NGC 5395 = H I-190 = h1723, along with NGC 5394, on 16 May 1787 (sweep 738) and recorded "Two, that of the south [NGC 5395] cB, cL. Distance about 1.5'."  John Herschel made 3 observations and measured a fairly accurate position.


Spiral structure was recorded several times at Birr Castle, though the observations are listed in the 1861 and 1880 publications under h1713 = GC 3717 = NGC 5378.  On 24 Apr 1854, R.J. Mitchell logged "centre pB; oval ns, among sev st.  I thought the n end the broader and suspected a dark space preceding nucleus.  A pB patch of neby np."  On 1 May 1854 he added "Singular object; the main body of neb has a B Nucl and is E ns, the southern end bends back suddenly at a sharp angle and extends np past the neb, ending in a B, R patch or Nucl."  On 19 Feb 1855, he reported "Neby seems to reach the knot np.  There is knot or star in the arm p and some condensation in the centre of neb.  I think F neby reaches up to the star north.  Finally, he sketched the pair on 17 Apr 1855 and noted "Mr Johnstone Stoney [who was visiting between professorial duties at Queen's College Galway] saw the p branch extend round the south end of the main neb and continued on to the north, when after a second turn it joined the nucleus."

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): at 200x; NGC 5408 appeared fairly faint, small, elongated ~2:1 SW-NE, 0.8'x0.4'.  A faint star is at the southwest end.  Located just 3' NNW of mag 6.1 HD 122532 and the galaxy is bracketed by a mag 10 star 1.5' SW and a mag 11 star 2' E.  The "faint star" noted on the southwest end may be an ultra-luminous star formation region (see below).


This nearby dwarf irregular starburst galaxy lies 15.6 million light years distant in the M83/Centaurus A group.  It was misclassified as a planetary nebula in the first edition of the Sky Catalogue 2000 and NGC 2000.  Henize 3-959 = StWr 4-9 likely refers to the small clump of HII regions on the southwest side of the galaxy.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5408 = h3553 on 5 Jun 1834 and recorded "eF; E between 2 vS stars, a little sf."  His position (single observation) is 2' south of the emission-line galaxy ESO 325-047.  This galaxy was misclassified as a planetary in the Sky Catalogue 2000 and the NGC 2000 because it was found by Stock and Wroblewski in 1972 (SKWL 4-9) and listed as a PN in a PK update list (PK 317+19.1) with the comment "extragalactic HII region?".  In 1972, Allen reported this object as a peculiar galaxy with a redshift of 500km/s.  MCG does not label -07-29-006 as NGC 5408.

48" (5/3/19): this striking interacting pair (Arp 111) consists of a tidally disrupted spiral on the north side and a compact elliptical or lenticular on the south side, separated by 20" between centers. At 613x, the central core region or bar of the spiral appeared bright, fairly small, elongated ~2:1 N-S, ~0.3'x0.15', with a very bright nucleus. A faint spiral arm was easily seen attached at the north end and extending directly west, making an angle of perhaps 110° with the central region. This arm spread out a bit as it faded at its west tip.  The southern spiral arm, which extends east, was seen as a dim glow but lacked a distinct edge and merged into the low surface brightness halo on the east side. The southern component (VV 120c) appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 0.3' diameter, small bright nucleus.


MCG +06-31-046, a third component of this system, is situated 1' S and appeared faint, fairly small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 20"x15", low even surface brightness.  A mag 15 star is 0.5' NNW.

A non-stellar knot companion (VV 120c) appearing like a second bright "nucleus" was visible at the southeast end of the halo.  At 322x, VV 120c was easily resolved and appeared faint to fairly faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  A mag 15 star is just off the southwest side.  MCG +06-31-046 at mag 17.1V, is just 1' S of the pair and was glimpsed several times for brief moments and confirmed at 322x.


17.5" (7/16/01): fairly faint, fairly small, irregular shape, ~1' diameter.  Very unusual appearance like a faint, partially resolved cluster as a couple of faint "stars" are involved.  The star is just off the southwest side and a fainter mag 15 star is attached at the southeast end.  At moments, a stellar nucleus further confuses the observation.  The "star" at the southeast end is VV 120c = PGC 49949, a compact interacting companion.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 5421 = St XI-22 on 9 Jun 1880.  He noted two very faint stars were involved - one of these is mostly likely the southern component of this interacting pair.

18" (4/30/11): this is a mag 14.7 star on line to the north of the galaxy pair NGC 5426 and NGC 5427 (Arp 271).  Situated 2.9' NNE of the center of NGC 5427.  Tempel made several false sightings (also NGC 5429, NGC 5432 and NGC 5435) around the pair of galaxies.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5428, along with NGC 5429, 5432 and 5435 in 1882, while observing NGC 5426/5427.  In the narrative portion of this fifth discovery paper (AN 2439) he mentioned that the first two of these were near the interacting pair and one was even on a line with NGC 5426/5427.

24" (7/1/16): at 375x; moderately to fairly bright, elongated 5:2 NNW-SSE, ~2'x0.8', contains a small bright elongated core (bar).  The surface brightness in irregular with some interesting structure.  I had an impression of a spiral arm extending north on the east side of the halo.


A fairly faint nonstellar knot (Holm 569B), 6"-8" diameter, is at the southeast end of the bar [21" from center].  There is a small dip in brightness between the central region and the knot.  Bill Keel considered the knot an extremely luminous HII region, but a recent paper assumes NGC 5430 is a minor merger and the "knot" is an off-center dwarf satellite with a triggered star formation.


17.5" (6/7/97): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated ~2:1 NNW-SSE, brighter core containing a stellar nucleus.  A mag 14-15 "star" is involved at the south-southeast end.  This "star" may confuse the apparent position angle of the galaxy as the major axis (including halo) is N-S.  A faint pair of mag 14.5 stars follows by 2.0'.


The stellar object at the south-southeast end is a strong HII emission knot (Ho 569b = Mrk 799a) thought to contain a large number of type-O and Wolf-Rayet stars.


17.5" (4/5/97): moderately bright and large, elongated 5:2 NNW-SSE, 2.0'x0.8', brighter core increases to an occasional stellar nucleus.  A mag 15 "star" is close southeast and a mag 14.5 pair at 12" separation lies 2.0' ENE of center.


8" (4/24/82): faint, small, round.  Located southeast of NGC 5376 and NGC 5389.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5430 = H II-827 = h1738 on 17 Mar 1790 (sweep 948) and logged "eF, S, E, but nearly R."  CH's reduced position is 3' north of UGC 8937.  JH measured an accurate position on a single observation.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5436, along with NGC 5437 and 5438, on 28 Jun 1883 while observing the NGC 5416 group.  In the narrative portion of list VII he wrote "Since then I have repeatedly seen the new nebula in group III-56 and found 3 new nebula here; these three are in a line, 2'-3' away from each other and follow north near the [mag 9] star, the northernmost is quite bright."  He did not measure positions and only a single rough position is given in the NGC for NGC 5436, 5437 and 5438.

This remark applies to all vF nebulae.  The double star is new [SWI 1 = ADS 9090]."


Bob Erdmann noted that Krakatau went off in Indonesia on Aug. 26-28, 1883 about a month after his original discovery!  Although this was the first nebula Swift discovered while systematically searching, a few were discovered earlier in April and June (NGC 3522, 3588, 6317, 6388, 6382), while still testing and adjusting the telescope.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5445 = H III-413 = h1742 on 1 May 1785 (sweep 405) and simply noted "vF".  His offset from NGC 5444 points directly to UGC 8976.  JH made the single observation "pF; near a * 13m sp."

William Herschel discovered NGC 5446 = H III-57 on 19 Mar 1784 (sweep 179) and recorded "eF, S, suspected with 157 and verified with 240."  There is nothing at his (single) position, but 30 sec of RA west is CGCG 074-075 = PGC 50239.  As WH's offsets in his early sweeps were often poor in time, this identification is very reasonable.  This galaxy is one of three found by Wilhelm Tempel in June of 1883 (along with NGC 5836 and 5837), and catalogued as NGC 5438.  So, NGC 5446 is likely identical to NGC 5438.


RNGC and PGC (and secondary sources such as Megastar) misidentify CGCG 074-093 = PGC 50239 as NGC 5438.   This galaxy is 1.0 min of RA following WH's position and is fainter than NGC 5438, so is a less likely candidate.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

NGC 5447

14 02 27.9 +54 16 34; UMa


24" (5/24/20): at 375x; NGC 5447 is the brighter (slightly higher surface brightness) of two close HII regions (with NGC 5450) situated  on the SW edge of M101, 8' from the center and just off the south side of a 14th magnitude star.  NGC 5447 appeared moderately bright, compact, ~15"x10" N-S.  There is a small gap between the two adjacent HII regions.


18" (6/21/03): at 215x this fairly prominent HII region appeared as an elongated patch oriented NNW-SSE, perhaps 25"x8", located just south of a mag 13.5 star.  At 323x this patch clearly resolved into two sections -- within 30" of the star is a very compact knot, ~6"-10" diameter.  There may be a small gap to the south with a larger extension to the SSE (this is NGC 5450).  Located on the opposite side of M101 as NGC 5462.


17.5" (6/7/97): brightest HII region on the preceding side of M101 located 7.8' SW of center.  Appears as a very elongated glow NW-SE situated just south of a mag 13.5 star.  A very small knot is partially resolved at the north edge within a common halo with the extension to the SE.


13": this is a knot in an outer arm of M101 on the western side.  Easily visible, compact, round.  Located symmetrically opposite from NGC 5462 on the opposite side of the core.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5447 = H III-787 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921) and noted "vF, vS."  His position was 20 seconds of RA following the bright HII complex (NGC 5447/5450) on the southwest side of M101.  This region was clearly marked Iota on the sketch of the HII regions by Lord Rosse in the 1861 and 1880 publications.


John Herschel assigned this knot two GC numbers as he was not sure if his father's object was the same as the one on Lord Rosse's woodcut, but both GC designations were combined into NGC 5447.

24" (5/24/20): at 375x; this M101 HII region appeared faint, very small, round, low surface brightness.  Probably less obvious than NGC 5451, which is 2.5' NE.  Situated 6.8 W of center and 3.5' N of NGC 5457/540.  NGC 5449 has two adjacent components, separated by 20".


18" (6/21/03): marginal object at 323x, but backing down to 215x a weak but definite glow was visible, perhaps 15"-20" diameter.  Located 3.5' N of NGC 5457.


17.5" (6/7/97): extremely low contrast HII knot in M101.  Highly suspected hazy spot 3.5' N of NGC 5457 but difficult to confirm.


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered the numerous knots in M101 during observations in April and May 1851.  Samuel Hunter sketched NGC 5449 in Apr 1861 based on multiple observations. The NGC position (based on the sketch) is just 1' too far south.

NGC 5450

14 02 29.5 +54 16 14; UMa


24" (5/24/20): at 375x; larger of a close pair of HII regions with NGC 5447, located at the SW end of the halo 8' from center, and just south of a 14th magnitude star.  NGC 5450 is moderately bright, ~20"x10", and is elongated in the direction of NGC 5447.  The nearby star is 50" N.  The two HII complexes were cleanly resolved at 375x.


18" (6/21/03): See description for NGC 5447.  NGC 5450 appeared just resolved from NGC 5447 at 323x and was an elongated patch oriented NNW-SSE, ~20"x6".  The entire complex spans ~45".


17.5" (6/7/97): this is the bright HII region on the west side of M101 8' SW of center.  Connected with NGC 5447 (see description). Appears as a very elongated glow NW-SE just south of a mag 13.5 star.  A very small knot is partially resolved at the north edge (NGC 5447) within a common halo with NGC 5450.


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered the numerous knots in M101 during observations in April and May 1851.  Samuel Hunter sketched NGC 5449 in Apr 1861 based on multiple observations.  John Herschel later computed the GC position based on the sketch as 33" south of NGC 5447.  Harold Corwin identifies NGC 5450 as the southeast component of the HII region connected with NGC 5447.  Dreyer modified the position of NGC 5447 2' further north, so the NGC position of the pair is further apart.

NGC 5451

14 02 37.0 +54 21 45; UMa


24" (5/24/20): at 375x; this M101 HII region appeared faint and pretty faint, small, round, 12" to 15" diameter.  Nearly collinear the mag 12.9 star 1.3' N of center of M101 and a mag 13.6 star 3.4' NW of center. Two mag 15.5-16 stars are 1' SW.


18" (6/28/03): very difficult, low surface brightness glow, ~10"-15" in size, requiring averted vision to glimpse.  More difficult than two mag 15.5 stars separated by 13", which are location 1' WSW.  The combined glow of these stars could easily mislead the observer into logging these as NGC 5451!


18" (6/21/03): initially I picked up a small, hazy glow nearly collinear with a mag 12.9 star just north of the core of M101 and a slightly fainter star due west.  But in good moments, this very small glow resolved into two stellar objects, probably appearing slightly hazy due to the background glow of the outer halo.  After a more careful view, I noticed an extremely faint knot with averted vision, ~15" diameter, located ~2' ENE of this pair -- this is NGC 5451.  It seems likely that the observation from 6/7/97 refers to the pair of faint stars that initially confused me.


17.5" (6/7/97): this is a difficult, low contrast HII region in M101 located ~5' WNW of center.  Appears very faint, extremely small, round, starry center?


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered the numerous knots in M101 during observations made in Apr and May 1851.

18" (6/21/03): required averted and concentration to confirm a small, low surface brightness glow, just visible over the background glow of the spiral arm this HII region resides.  In fact, between NGC 5453 and the core is an inner arm that contains a couple of HII knots that are more evident!


17.5": this low surface brightness HII region in M101 was barely distinguishable at 220x as a very low surface brightness enhancement superimposed on the background glow of a spiral arm 3.4' SW of center.


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered the numerous knots in M101 during observations made in Apr and May 1851.  Samuel Hunter made a remarkly accurate sketch of M101 in Apr 1861.

24" (5/24/20):  at 375x; I identified all visible HII regions and stellar associations in M101, 10 of which have NGC designations (5447, 5449, 5450, 5451, 5453, 5455, 5458, 5461, 5462 and 5471).  In addition, I logged 4 additional low contrast knots from Banich's 2013 article in Sky & Telescope.


18" (6/21/03 and 6/28/03): the following HII regions were observed --

NGC 5447: at 215x this fairly prominent HII region appeared as an elongated patch oriented NNW-SSE, perhaps 25"x8", located just south of a mag 13.5 star.  At 323x this patch clearly resolved into two sections -- within 30" of the star is a very compact knot, ~6"-10" diameter.  There may be a small gap to the south with a larger extension to the SSE (this is NGC 5450).  Located on the opposite side of M101 as NGC 5462.


NGC 5449: marginal object at 323x, but backing down to 215x a weak but definite glow was visible, perhaps 15"-20" diameter.  Located 3.5' N of NGC 5457.


NGC 5450: just resolved from NGC 5447 at 323x and was an elongated patch oriented NNW-SSE, ~20"x6".  The entire complex spans ~45".


NGC 5451: very difficult, low surface brightness glow, ~10"-15" in size, requiring averted vision to glimpse.  More difficult than two mag 15.5 stars separated by 13", which are location 1' WSW.  The combined glow of these stars could easily mislead the observer into logging these as NGC 5451!  In fact on 6/21/03 I initially picked up a small, hazy glow nearly collinear with a mag 12.9 star just north of the core of M101 and a slightly fainter star due west.  But in good moments, this very small glow resolved into two stellar objects, probably appearing slightly hazy due to the background glow of the outer halo.  After a more careful view, I noticed an extremely faint knot with averted vision, ~15" diameter, located ~2' ENE of this pair -- this is NGC 5451.


NGC 5453: required averted and concentration to confirm a small, low surface brightness glow, just visible over the background glow of the spiral arm this HII region resides.  In fact, between NGC 5453 and the core is an inner arm which contains a couple of HII knots which are more evident!


Anon knot: two small, low contrast knots are visible in the spiral arm that is attached on the west side of the core of M101 and wraps around the south side towards the east. These are situated just 1.7' SW of the center of M101.  Although this knotty structure does not have a NGC number it is slightly more evident than a few of the faintest NGC HII regions.


NGC 5455: compact knot, round, easily identified as forms the southern vertex of a triangle with two 13th magnitude stars to the NW and NE.  At moments, a stellar nucleus or superimposed star pops out at 323x.


NGC 5458: very faint glow 3' S of the core of M101 on a line between a 13th magnitude star ~7' S of the center of M101.  Requires averted for a definite sighting and appears to have a low, even surface brightness, ~20" diameter.  Easier to view than NGC 5453.


NGC 5461: at 435x (5.2mm Pentax) a fairly bright quasi-stellar knot is attached at the NE end with a relatively faint extension (even surface brightness) extending to the SW.  On 6/21 at 215x, this prominent HII region has a high surface brightness and stands out well.  Increasing the power to 435x, there is a stellar or quasi-stellar core offset at the NE end with a faint extension to the SW.  Backing down to 323x and using a UHC filter, the glow decreases in size, but the star-like core seems to increase slightly in contrast.


NGC 5462: this HII region is probably the largest continuous piece.  It appears very elongated 3:1 or 7:2 SW-NE, roughly 60"x18". On 6/21 appeared fairly bright and relatively large, elongated 3:1, ~50"x17" SW-NE.  This HII region has an irregular surface brightness with a bright, nearly stellar knot at the NE end.


NGC 5471: highest surface brightness of any of the HII regions in M101.  Appears very similar to a small, elliptical galaxy -- even contains a small, brighter core.  Situated beyond the main glow of the galaxy, 11.5' NE of the core of M101.  On 6/21 at 323x appears similar to a compact, round galaxy.  Furthest NE of all the HII regions and well separated from the main glow of M101.  Interestingly, this was one of the few HII regions that did show a positive contrast response to a UHC filter at 161x and 215x.


13.1" (6/4/84): four HII regions resolved including NGC 5447, NGC 5458, NGC 5461, NGC 5462.


13.1" (4/24/82): fairly bright, very large, round, about 20' diameter, bright core.  Fairly low surface brightness but beautifully resolved into several distinct arms and sections of arms with a pinwheel design.  Obvious mottling along the spiral arms which appear clumpy with two or more easily recognized HII regions. At least six stars are superimposed.


Pierre Méchain discovered M101 = NGC 5457 = h1744 on 27 Mar 1781.  On 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921), William Herschel described "a very bright small nucleus with extensive nebulosity, pretty well determined on the preceding side, but very diffuse to the north following. Includes the two following nebulae [III-788 = NGC 5461 and III-789 = NGC 5462], and seems to extend 20', perhaps 30' or more."


Bindon Stoney (LdR's assistant) sketched the various HII knots, spiral arms and superimposed stars and measured offsets in 1851.  Samuel Hunter's superb sketch from 29 Apr 1861 was included at the last minute in the 1861 publication.  This is probably the finest and most accurate sketch of a spiral galaxy done at Birr Castle and is very favorably compared with the DSS.


M101 has had 4 supernovae, the first (SN 1909A) was discovered by Max Wolf.  It was announced as a variable star in Feb 1909 and assigned the designation SS UMa.  The others are SN 1951H, SN 1970G and Type Ia SN 2011fe, which reached mag 10.9.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 5460 = D 431= h3555 on 7 May 1826 from Parramatta with his 9.75-inch speculum reflector and described "a curiously curved line of small stars of nearly equal magnitudes; two stars of 7th magnitude following."  He observed the cluster 3 times.  John Herschel first observed the cluster on 6 Aug 1831 and recorded "a region of large, bright stars, 8, 9...etc. mag; a very coarse cluster. Place that of a brilliant group, one of which is a double star class III." Two nights later he wrote, "Place of a double star in a semi-elliptic group forming part of it, but insulated in a large scattered cluster or tract of bright stars." On a later sweep he logged "a region of large stars very loosely distributed, but which yet decidedly form a cluster. Place that of a pretty close double star (four arcseconds) in the middle of a group of 8. The cluster is 30' diameter, and is divided into distinct groups."

William Herschel discovered NGC 5461 = H III-788 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921) and noted "vF, vS."  This HII region in M101 was recorded immediately after he logged M101 in the sweep.  His RA was ~25 seconds too large, but matches the offset with the HII region NGC 5462 to the northeast, which was logged next in the sweep.  John Herschel assigned two numbers in the GC, as he was uncertain if this was the same as one of the knots sketched by Lord Rosse (it corresponds with the knot labeled n2).  Dreyer combined the two GC designations in the NGC, though the position is poor.  Hermann Kobold measured an accurate micrometric position in 1898 using the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg.

24" (5/24/20): at 375x; this M101 HII region appeared relatively large and bright.  It is noticeably elongated ~45"x15" SW-NE, "pointing" in the direction of NGC 5461.


18" (6/28/03): this HII region is probably the largest continuous piece.  It appears very elongated 3:1 or 7:2 SW-NE, roughly 60"x18".


18" (6/21/03): fairly bright and relatively large, elongated 3:1, ~50"x17" SW-NE.  This HII region has an irregular surface brightness with a bright, nearly stellar knot at the NE end.


17.5" (6/7/97): moderately bright elongated knot in M101, extended 3:1 SW-NE, ~50"x20".  One of the largest and brightest HII regions in M101.


13": knot in M101 located in the same arm as NGC 5461 but further to the east.  This is an easily visible, compact, round knot on the opposite side of the core as NGC 5447.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5462 = H III-789 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921) and noted "vF, pS."  His offset from NGC 5461 was 7 seconds of time east and 2' north, compared to the actual offsets of 10 sec and 3' north.  John Herschel assigned two numbers in the GC, as he was uncertain if this was the same as one of the knots sketched by Lord Rosse (it corresponds with the knot labeled n1).  Dreyer combined the two GC designations in the NGC, though the position is poor.  Hermann Kobold measured an accurate micrometric position in 1898 using the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5463 = H III-58 on 19 Mar 1784 (sweep 179) and recorded as "eF, S.  Suspected with 157 and verified with 240; the latter power showed it a little elongated."  CH's reduction is 13 sec of RA east and 1' north of UGC 9017.


Wilhelm Tempel measured a micrometric position in list VIII (given in his table) that was used in the NGC.  His position, though, is 15 tsec too far west and 3' too far north.  But re-reducing his position with respect to his offset star yields an accurate match with UGC 9017.

48" (4/19/17): at 375x; very large, highly resolved cluster with chains of brighter stars, particularly in the halo, which extends to at least 8', but also passing through the richer 3' to 4' central section.  The surface brightness is relatively low due its loose structure (concentration class XII), even in the core.  The brighter stars seems superimposed over a layer of much fainter resolved stars.  At 697x, there were way too many visible stars for a reasonably accurate count but perhaps around 250 stars resolved.


17.5" (6/3/00): large, low surface brightness globular, 7'-8' in diameter.  Has a ragged, irregular surface brightness to the core and halo.  About 50-60 mag 14-15.5 stars are resolved at 280x-380x.  The brighter core is relatively large, perhaps 4' in diameter and appears offset to the west side of the resolved stars.  Many faint stars are peppered across the core.


17.5" (6/6/86): 40-50 mag 14-15 stars resolved at 220x in a 7' diameter.  Very spread out like a fairly rich open cluster with no distinct edges and only a weak concentration.


13.1" (5/26/84): roughly three dozen stars resolved about 14th magnitude.  Visible in 18x80 finder.


13.1" (5/14/83): few dozen mag 14 stars resolved across disc over extensive background haze.


8" (6/5/81): fairly large, low surface brightness with a "loose" structure.  A few faint stars are resolved across the disk at 100-165x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5466 = H VI-9 = h1746 on 17 May 1784 (sweep 219) and recorded "a large cluster of exceedingly small and compressed stars, about 6 or 7' in dia; a great many of the stars are visible, the rest so small as to appear nebulous; those that are visible are of one size and are scattered all over equally.  The cluster is of an irregularly round form."  The globular was placed in classification category VI for "very condensed and rich clusters of stars", although it is an unusually loose globular.  On 16 May 1831 JH described the cluster as "a fine L cl 7 or 8' dia; vgbM, but no nucleus.  The stars 11 or 12m down to an irresolvable mass; irreg R; excessively compressed.  A fine object.  Barely discernible in the 20 feet finder (2 1/2" in aperture)."  Wolfgang Steinicke notes that Heinrich d'Arrest observed it twice in 1856 using a 4.6-inch Merz refractor in Leipzig.

48" (5/12/18): NGC 5467 is a mag 15 star 2.2' SW of the center of NGC 5468.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5467, along with NGC 5465, in 1882 while observing NGC 5468.  In the narrative portion of list V, he simply noted two more very faint nebula to the southwest of NGC 5486, though did not provide offsets or positions.  These were probably communicated later to Dreyer.


There is are no nearby galaxies and both Dorothy Carlson and Harold Corwin identify NGC 5467 as a single star.  Independently, Bigourdan also logged this star as nebulous while trying to find Tempel's nebulae, and he reported it in his 4th Comptes Rendus list as #182 (later IC 973). Assuming the same star fooled both Tempel and Bigourdan, this is the only known case where a single star has both an NGC and IC designation!  Bigourdan's IC 974 is another nearby star he thought to be nebulous.


THe 1935 Helwan table of descriptions, identified NGC 5467 as "2 small condensations [HII region] south of the nucleusof NGC 5468".  These are evident on images, but unlikely seen by Tempel [one was quite evident in Lowrey's 48"].

48" (5/12/18): at 488x; NGC 5468 is a bright, fairly large 3-armed spiral!  It appeared sharply concentrated with a very bright small nucleus and a 2'-2.5' halo containing two arms and a detached segment of an arm.  One arm is nearly attached to the nucleus at its south side.  This arm was easily visible as it rotated counterclockwise to the west and separated from the core, ending due west of center [by 0.6'].  A low contrast arm begins just north of the nucleus and extends a short distance directly east. A faint 5" HII knot is just north of this arm.  Finally a detached, arm segment, oriented WSW to ENE, floats in the south side of the halo.  An easily visibile HII knot, ~8" diameter, is at its SW end.  Forms a pair with NGC 5472 5' E.  LEDA 1043616, a very low surface brightness galaxy, was picked up 6.4' SW.  Mag 8.3 HD 123265 lies 4.3' SSE.


17.5" (6/8/96): fairly faint, fairly large, round, 2.5' diameter.  The low but irregular surface brightness halo has a hint of mottling or structure.  Broad concentration to a ill-defined core and occasional small brighter nucleus.  Mag 8.3 SAO 139737 4.2' SSE detracts from viewing.  Forms a pair with NGC 5472 5.0' E.


8" (6/29/84): very faint, moderately large, very diffuse, elongated ~E-W.  Located 4' NNW of a mag 8.3 star.  A mag 10 star 11.9' SSE is collinear with NGC 5468 and the mag 8 star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5468 = H III-286 = h1745 on 5 Mar 1785 (sweep 380) and recorded "vF, L, brightest towards the north, and eF towards the southern borders." John Herschel made the single observation "vF; vL; R; gbM" and measured an accurate position.


R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" on 29 Mar 1856, recorded "1745 [NGC 5468] has a nucleus, light very patchy, 3 stars in edge; vF.  Query, spiral with a right-handed twist.  About 4' following is a S, pB, E knot."  The object following is NGC 5472.

The identification NGC 5469 = CGCG 74-136 is uncertain but if UGC 9084 was assumed by Tempel to be NGC 5482, then his NGC 5469 refers to CGCG 74-136.  CGCG 74-141 and -142 lie ~9' ESE.  See notes for NGC 5511, which may be CGCG 74-141.


17.5" (6/8/02): faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.  Just following a small triangle of mag 13-14 stars.  Forms a pair with UGC 9084 4.3' WNW.  NGC 5511 lies 10' ESE (all three faint galaxies collinear).


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5469 in 1883 while observing the NGC 5416 group.  In the narrative portion of paper VIII (AN 2527) he writes (translated by Wolfgang Steinicke) "III 59 [= NGC 5482] is 9s preceding, 2 1/2' south of a faint star 11m; the nebula is small and has in its center a faint star with very little nebular matter. Following the star 11m, there is at 15s, parallel to it [the star or NGC 5482?] a nice round nebula, III, without a faint star [in the center]. This nebula is also new."  There is no object matching this description or at the NGC position.


Instead, Harold Corwin suggests that Tempel probably confused UGC 9084 for NGC 5482.  This would imply, based on Tempel's description, that CGCG 074-136 = NGC 5469.  See Corwin's notes. The RNGC has misidentified CGCG 074-062 as NGC 5469. This galaxy is a close companion of NGC 5423 and is roughly 90' from the NGC position.

18" (6/21/03): at 323x appears similar to a compact, round galaxy.  Furthest NE of all the HII regions and well separated from the main glow of M101.  Interestingly, this was one of the few HII regions that displayed a positive contrast response to a UHC filter at 161x and 215x.


17.5" (6/7/97): this is one of brightest HII regions in M101, on the extreme NE end of the galaxy 11.5' from center.  Appears as a moderately bright knot, ~20" diameter.  This HII region stands out well due to its isolation and fairly high surface brightness with crisp halo.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 5471 on 22 Aug 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and measured it on 5 different nights.  He noted the mag 13 star that precedes by 9 sec of RA and questioned if this object was H III-789 with a 30 sec error in RA.  MCG misclassifies this HII region as a galaxy (MCG +09-23-030).

A roundish 2' diameter halo extends to the south.  A few faint, nearly stellar spots are on the east side of the halo.  The halo was uneven in surface brightness and I had a definite impression of spiral arm structure, but was unable to trace any specific arms.  This strongly "sloshed" galaxy is gravitationally distorted by interaction with M101.

The halo of the galaxy is a slightly elongated N-S oval glow with the core internally tangent on the north side.


18" (6/17/06): fairly bright, large, with an irregular asymmetric appearance.  Broadly concentrated to a 1' brighter core that resides on the north edge of the galaxy.  The 2.5' halo is slightly elongated N-S and spreads out from the core only towards the south!  The halo has a slightly mottled texture and fades at the periphery.  With averted vision the size increases to nearly 3'.  A mag 13.5-14 star is just north of the offset core.  A mag 13 pair at 14" lies 9' ESE.  This disturbed galaxy is a member of the M101 group.

Very unusual appearance as a large brighter knot of 0.8' diameter or a very eccentrically placed core is located at the NE edge.  The halo extends generally SW from this brighter spot.  About 3' diameter, no brightening at the geometric center.  A mag 14 star is just off the NE edge 0.8' beyond knot.  Located 45' SSE of M101 and the asymmetry is from being tidally deformed by M101.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5474 = H I-214 on 1 May 1788 (sweep 840) and recorded "cB, terminating abruptly to the north, and diffused to the south."  Indeed, this galaxy is very asymmetric, with the nucleus at the north edge of the galaxy!

See observing notes for NGC 5503.


Edward Swift, Lewis' 15 year-old son, discovered NGC 5502 = Sw. I-29 on 9 May 1886 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R; ee diff; between 2 stars, one a wide double."  There is only a single galaxy here (MCG +10-20-077) but Lewis found it again two nights later, thought it was new and it was listed a second time as Sw. I-30 (later NGC 5503), with the description "eeeF; vS; R; ee dif; forms with 2 stars a right angle triangle."


In the introduction to his second discovery list, Swift mentions Sw. I-29 should probably be struck out without giving an explanation. Nevertheless, Dreyer catalogued both entries as NGC 5502 and 5503.  Since NGC 5502 was discovered first, this designation should take historical precedence. Swift made several other duplicate observations of galaxies, though this is an unusual case involving a father and son!  See Corwin's notes.

Lewis Swift found NGC 5503 = Sw. I-30 on 11 May 1886 and recorded "eeeF; vS; R; ee dif; forms with 2 stars a right angle triangle."  This was a reobservation of NGC 5502 = Sw.

The identification of NGC 5511 with either galaxy in this pair is uncertain because of Hough's confusing description, but CGCG 074-141 has a higher surface brightness than -142, so seems to be the more likely of the two candidates.

George Hough discovered NGC 5511 on 10 May 1883 with the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at Dearborn Observatory while searching for d'Arrest's comet.  His position is ~2.5' east of VV 299, a 1' pair of galaxies (CGCG 074-141 and -142).  His description reads "small, very faint, star 10m, 10m preceding."  Ignoring his typo, there is no 10th mag star preceding, though a mag 10 star is ~3.5' east-southeast.  Assuming Hough found one of the pair, CGCG 074-141 is more likely based on my visual observation.  CGCG doesn't label either galaxy as NGC 5511.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 5524 on 19 Apr 1855 while observing NGC 5529.  Although no absolute position was given, he placed this nova 6' west and 1' north of NGC 5527 (another LdR discovery).  JH was confused which two objects were being offset and the GC/NGC position is erroneous, but falls closest to CGCG 191-067.  Most modern catalogues misidentify this galaxy as NGC 5524. According to Harold Corwin's analysis, CGCG 191-067 = NGC 5527 and the best candidate for NGC 5524 is the unequal double star at the position given here.  This implies that Mitchell should have placed this double star 6' west and 1' south of NGC 5527.  In November 2014, though, Corwin decided a faint star, which is 5.5' from NGC 5527 and north of it by just under 1', is more consistent with Mtchell's estimates.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 5527 on 19 Apr 1855 with LdR's 72" during an observation of the NGC 5529 field.  This nova was described as "another vF about 15' np [of NGC 5529]."  CGCG 191-067 = PGC 50868 is a good match with this description (the actual separation is 17')  Most galaxy catalogues misidentify CGCG 191-067 as NGC 5524 (this was also Bigourdan's interpretation).  But NGC 5524 derives from Mitchell's description "another eeF about 6' preceding and 1' north of this last [NGC 5527]."  Corwin identifies NGC 5524 as an unequal double star, located 6' preceding and 1' south of NGC 5527.


RNGC, PGC, SIMBAD and WikiSky misidentify MCG +06-31-085a as NGC 5527.  MCG +06-31-085a is an extremely low surface brightness galaxy 0.3 min of RA west and 2' south of NGC 5529.  NED and HyperLeda correctly identify PGC 50868 as NGC 5527.  Finally, Rosse also mentions a "vF neb sf [NGC 5529], and in this direction is CGCG 191-071 (see observing notes).  Unfortunately this object didn't receive a NGC number, probably due to the lack of offset or a sketch.

George Johnstone Stoney or his brother Bindon Stoney discovered NGC 5542, along with NGC 5538, on 6 Mar 1851.  While observing the field of NGC 5546 he noted "another 5' preceding [NGC 5546]."  There were no later observations to determine a more precise position.  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position (3 observations in 1865) and noted it preceded NGC 5546 by 16-17 sec of RA.

48" (5/12/18): at 488x; Arp 199 = NGC 5544/5545 is a striking overlapping pair.  The western galaxy NGC 5544 (type (R)SB0/a) appeared bright, moderately large, round, sharp concentration with a very bright round core.  The outer halo (spiral arms that form a pseudo-ring) extends ~50" diameter with a very low surface brightness and overlaps with NGC 5545.


18" (5/3/08): NGC 5544 is the southwest component of an interacting, contact pair with NGC 5545 (Arp 199).  At 280x it appeared as a fairly faint, small, round knot, ~25" diameter (very faint outer halo not seen), weak even concentration.  NGC 5544 has a slightly higher surface brightness than elongated NGC 5545.  Member of the NGC 5557 group (LGG 378).


17.5" (3/23/85): very elongated streak WSW-ENE, moderately large, uneven surface brightness.  This is a contact pair appearing as two brighter knots at the SW end (NGC 5544) and the NE end (NGC 5545).


William Herschel discovered NGC 5544 = H II-419 = h1771 on 1 May 1785 (sweep 405) and recorded a single nebula, described as "F, pL", so he did not resolve this double system with NGC 5545.  John Herschel made three observations and logged on 27 Apr 1827 (sweep 72) "F; S; a double nebula or two which run together, pos 10° nf by diagram."  Interestingly, although JH described this galaxy in the GC (3833) as "F; pS; E 80°; D[ouble] or biN[uclear]", he credited LdR with the discovery of GC 3834 = NGC 5545.

48" (5/12/18): at 488x; the eastern member of this striking overlapping pair appeared fairly bright, very elongated WSW-ENE, ~1'x0.3'.  Contains a brighter elongated core region (not as prominent as the core of NGC 5544).  The northeast end (an outer spiral arm) dimmed significantly and appeared as a very low surface brightness curving arc.  The western outer arm merged with the outer halo of NGC 5544 in a somewhat dimmer region.


18" (5/3/08): this galaxy forms the eastern component of an interacting, contact pair (Arp 199) with NGC 5544 attached at the WSW end. At 280x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 SW-NE, 0.9'x0.3', weak concentration.  NGC 5544 appears as a brighter knot attached at the preceding end!  Member of the NGC 5557 group (LGG 378), which lies 17' ESE.


17.5" (3/23/85): double system elongated WSW-ENE and attached to NGC 5544 at the WSW end, 0.6' between centers.  Appears larger than NGC 5544.  The two systems are separated by just a small darker region of lower surface brightness but are not cleanly resolved.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5545 on 27 Apr 1827 as he noted "a double nebula [with NGC 5544] which run together pos 10° nf by diagram."  The Stoney brothers, LdR's assistants, found the pair on 10 Apr 1852 and noted "either a double nebula or 2 knots of one neb."  R.J. Mitchell also logged NGC 5545 on 17 Mar 1855 while observing NGC 5544.  He recorded a "D Neb; the p one [NGC 5544] has a nucleus or a stellar point in the center, the following one [NGC 5545] is elongated, no nucleus but lbM."  A sketch was made and included in the 1880 publication on plate V.  John Herschel credited LdR with the discovery in the GC and Dreyer followed this in the NGC.  Steinicke concurs that JH should be credited with the discovery.


The NGC positions for both objects are very close, but misleading as the declination for NGC 5545 (nearest arcminute) is slightly south of NGC 5544, instead of north.

His position is within 1.5' of UGC 9156, which is identified as NGC 5549, but there no object preceding by 3'-4'.  In his 1912 update of WH's catalogues, Dreyer suggests this observation may refer to NGC 5542 and NGC 5546, which differ by the required amount.


On a second observation on 12 May 1793 (sweep 1042), H's position for III-551 is 2.4' southwest of UGC 9148!  So, his two sweeps refer to different objects.  JH also made two observations of UGC 9148 and measured an accurate position, but he was uncertain if this was his father's object and gave them both GC designations.  Dreyer combined both GC numbers in the NGC.

17.5" (6/1/02): faint, small, slightly elongated WSW-ENE, 0.4'x0.3', even surface brightness.  A mag 14 star is 1.0' SE of center.  Located 3.1' NE of a mag 11 star.  UGC 9177 lies 11' NNE.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5562 on 28 Jun 1883 while observing NGC 5511 and reported it in discovery list VIII.  In the narrative portion of the paper, he describes (translation from Wolfgang Steinicke) "Two degrees north of it [NGC 5511], I found on June 28th a new nebula and have seen it several times. At this time I can specify its position only from Argelander's atlas [the BD]: 14h 13m Os +10d 39'. It is small, III; 3' south-preceding the nebula is a star 11m, and 3 sec following is a very faint star."  Tempel's rough position is 16' south of UGC 9174 but his description applies to this galaxy.  Bigourdan was unable to recover this galaxy (probably due to the poor offset from the BD star).  See Corwin's identification notes.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5564 = Sw. I-33, along with NGC 5558 and 5565, on 14 Jun 1884 and recorded "S; vvF; sf of 2; v diff; a star midway between them."  His position is just 2' south of NGC 5563 and Dreyer mentions in the NGC Notes section that NGC 5564 and 5565 are probably identical to NGC 5563.  But Harold Corwin notes that Swift's description applies to NGC 5554 (discovered earlier by Marth), as  a star is midway between the two galaxies.  NGC 5565 was placed just 30" south of NGC 5564, but there is nothing at this position. RNGC classifies NGC 5564 as nonexistent.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5565 = Sw. I-34, along with NGC 5558 and 5564, on 14 Jun 1884 and recorded "S; vvF; R; v diff."  His position is 30" south of Sw. I-33 = NGC 5564, which is probably a duplicate of NGC 5554 (discovered earlier by Marth).  Assuming this is true, his offset suggests NGC 5565 refers to a mag 15.5 star situated 1.8' southeast of NGC 5554.


Harold Corwin mentions that Swift called NGC 5558 and 5564 "np of 2" and "sf of 2" and carefully describes the nearby field, although the positions imply NGC 5564 and 5565 would be a much closer pair.  Another possibility, is that NGC 5565 is actually a duplicate of NGC 5563.  In any case, there are only three galaxies in this area, and all were found previously by Marth.  See Corwin's identification notes.

See observing notes for NGC 5519.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5570 = H III-12 = h1781 on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 110) and recorded "a nebula, it is excessively obscure."  His published description adds "vF, forming an arch with 3 stars.” but there is nothing near his position.


Harold Corwin suggests H. III-12 is the first observation of NGC 5519: "NGC 5519 indeed forms an arch with two stars west and southwest, and a third is superposed on the galaxy.  WH's observation puts N5570 21m 15s p, 0d 34' s of 31 Bootis.  This is 6 minutes of time off the position of N5519.  I think that the "21m" is a transcription error and should read "27m."  In that case, the RA as well as the Dec and the description would match N5519.”


Interestingly, it appears Herschel observed this galaxy again on 12 May 1793 (sweep 1043) and noted "2 vS stars with nebulosity suspected between them."  His position was 3' too far south, but matches the mag 14.5 star attached to the following end and the nucleus of the galaxy.  He didn't assign an internal discovery number or H-designation for this observation.


Searching for his father's H. III-12, John Herschel recorded h1781 on 9 May 1828 as "Not vF; S; R; bM. (RA by working list.)"  His position was roughly the same as his father's.  On the second sweep he simply noted "Seen.  as also III. 551 [NGC 5546] in the same parallel, but considerably dist in RA.”


The RNGC and PGC (but not MCG or CGCG) misidentify CGCG 047-007 as NGC 5570.  This galaxy is roughly 1 min of RA west of WH's position and 5' south, but doesn't match his description of "forming an arch with two stars."  Still, it's possible CGCG 047-007 = h1781.

17.5" (6/2/00): at 280x-500x, three very faint stars are resolved including a very close double.  It is easy to see how this close "clump" of stars (four on the POSS) could have been mistaken for a nebula.  Located with a group of faint NGC galaxies and 30' SW of a mag 5 star.


Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 5571 = Big. 73 on 27 May 1886.  His position in his second Comptes Rendus list corresponds with a small group of 4 stars.  According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan thought there was some nebulosity on his first observation (used in the NGC), but he resolved the stars on the second attempt.  RNGC incorrectly equates NGC 5571 with NGC 5579.  See Corwin's identification notes.

E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 5584 on 27 Jul 1881 with his 5-inch refractor from Nashville and it's probably the first galaxy Barnard discovered.  He reported this galaxy in Sidereal Messenger I, p135 (1882) as "very faint nebulosity of moderate extension; pretty even in light.  A small star involved.  A brighter star lies north and just free of nebulosity."  It was also announced in AN 108, p.369 with a position measured by Oliver Wendell at the Harvard Observatory.  He noted that the nebula was "examined by, among others, Mr. Tempel and is here inserted merely as a matter of record", but there is not published observation by Tempel.  Swift reported a mottled appearance and thought more light and power would resolve it.

John Herschel found NGC 5588 = h1789 on 9 May 1826 (sweep 28) and simply noted "eF."  There is nothing at his position.  On the same sweep, he recorded NGC 5590 and measured an accurate position, but h1788 = NGC 5589 was not recorded.


Harold Corwin suggests h1789 may be a duplicate observation of NGC 5589.  JH placed NGC 5588 about as far south of NGC 5590 as NGC 5589 is north and RA's are identical, so if he reversed the direction of the declination offset from NGC 5590, then his position for h1789 = NGC 5588 would match NGC 5589.  Discussed in private email on 12 Sep 1994.  See Corwin's identification notes for his summary.

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): picked up at 76x as fairly striking elongated group of stars.  At 228x, this is a distinctive group of 11 brighter mag 10/11 stars including a nice pair (h 4675 = 10/11 at 8") and perhaps 30 stars total in a 7'x2.5' group that is quite elongated E-W.  The cluster is well-detached in the field.  In the center is a nearly 1.5' region devoid of stars which separates the cluster into two subgroups with the double star just following this vacuity.  Appears fully resolved, even at low power.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5593 = D 350 = h3566 on 8 May 1826 and described "a curved line of small stars, south preceding a star of the 7th magnitude".  Although his position is well off, the description applies though the star of 7th magnitude - not the cluster - is south-southwest.


John Herschel described NGC 5593 as "a poor, coarse, oblong cluster, which is the most condensed part of a rich region of stars 10m. Place of a double star [HJ 4675] in the following part."

William Herschel discovered NGC 5594 = H III-135 on 19 May 1784 (sweep 220) and noted "eF, vS, stellar, 240x verified it."  In the notes section of the NGC, Dreyer says there was a discrepancy of 10' in the declination between Caroline Herschel's and Auwers' positions.  He used CH's [her position was actually 6' off in dec] though Auwers' was more accurate.  In Dreyer's 1912 correction list he also notes "the PD should be 63° 8'."  Using this correction, H III-135 = CGCG 133-046.

Copeland observed the field at Birr Castle on 9 Apr 1874 and noted, "2 nebulae, both S, nf one the fainter."  A diagram with west down, published in the large 1880 monograph, appears to show NGC 5602, labeled Alpha with a bright core, and probably CGCG 272-003, labeled Beta.  The orientation of the pair is correct, although NGC 5602, the north-following object, is much brighter.  Two additional objects, labeled Delta and Gamma (indicated with a question mark) are also included, those these are likely faint stars.  Probably since there was no follow up observation and Dreyer didn't know which object was NGC 5602, he didn't assign CGCG 272-003 an NGC designation.

Two of these stars form a wide 21" pair on the west side and are surrounded by several faint companions creating a rich clump.  The main group is only 2.5' in diameter, though it is situated in a glittering, rich star field so the cluster is not completely detached from the surrounding field.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5606 = D 313 = h3568 on 8 May 1826 and recorded "a very minute group of small stars, about 2' long, extended in the parallel of the equator."  JH made a single observation on 6 July 1836: "a small close group of large and small stars, forming a cluster."

George Bond discovered NGC 5632 = Au 33 = HN 11, along with NGC 5651 and 5658, on 9 Feb 1853 with the 15-inch Merz refractor during the Harvard Zone observations.  Auwers included this object in his 1862 table on new nebulae.  Bond's discovery position in AN 1453 is just 30" north of a mag 15.4 star.


But in 2105 Yann Pothier found that Bond misidentified his offset star as Star 118 instead of 129 (in Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol I, part II, p 282-3).  Once corrected, his position ("Another nebula precedes No. 118 2m 30s, and is in the same declination with star No. 118.") is 28 seconds of RA east of NGC 5691 and the other two objects also match up with galaxies.

V = 9.4;  Size 4.9';  Surf Br = 0.1


48" (5/10/18):  Beautiful globular cluster with 50 stars or more resolved at 375x!  Several streams or chains of stars (many easily visible) extend out of the central region, which is densely packed with faint stars over a bright, mottled background glow.  A few dozen very dim stars were constantly sparkling in and out of visibility so it wasn't possible to make a decent star count.  A very bright orange field star (mag 7.9 HD 127119) is superimposed in the halo on the eastern side [1.4' ESE of center].  Three additional brighter stars in the halo on the west and north side [incl. mag 11.9 star 1.7' NW of center] form a semicircle or crown, partially encircling the halo."  The cluster was ~4' diameter, though the outer halo was scraggly without a distinct edge.


17.5" (4/13/96): fairly bright, moderately large, irregularly round, 3.5' diameter.  Contains a large bright core of 2' diameter that appears mottled with stellarings or knots.  The brightest knot is on the northwest side of the core.  Set in a striking field between mag 8.5 SAO 139967 1.4' ESE of the globular and a mag 11 star 1.9' W, with a mag 10 star 3.7' SW of center.


17.5" (6/8/91): bright, round, 3.5' diameter.  Situated in a pretty field among three bright stars.  The small halo smoothly increases to a broadly concentrated core which is very mottled but not resolved.  A few very faint stars are resolved off the edges of the halo at 412x and a star or knot is visible at the west edge of the core.


8": moderately bright, moderately large.  A mag 10 star is on the east edge and a mag 12 star on the west edge.


This globular is possibly a former member of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy and appears to be situated in the trailing tidal stream.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5634 = H I-70 = h1813 on 5 Mar 1785 (sweep 380) and recorded "vB, cL, brighter about the middle and the brightness diminishing very gradually, irreg, situated between 3 or 4 considerable stars."

On 25 Apr 1848 William Parson (or assistant Rambaut) noted "A bright, double nebula".  JH assumed that one was NGC 5638 but the second object was new and assigned it a separate GC designation (3905) from II-580.  Later, Dreyer realized the second object was NGC 5636 and both GC designations are combined in the NGC.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5640 = H III-949 on 20 Dec 1797 (sweep 1074) and noted "eF, S, lE near the parallel [in RA]."  Dreyer mentions in the collected papers of WH that Bigourdan twice failed to find this object, but the RA may be nearly 2.0 tmin following the NGC position using a different reference star.


Corwin suggests NGC 5640 = CGCG 353-035.  This galaxy is 1.1 tmin east and 3' north of the NGC position though at this declination the difference in RA is negligible.  Using the position of NGC 5712 as a reference (the next object in the sweep), the position for III-949 is just 30 tsec west of CGCG 353-035, so this seems likely.  Another possibility is that NGC 5640 = CGCG 353-034 (same declination) which is visually brighter and elongated roughly east-west, but further off in RA.  See Corwin's notes for more on the story.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x I was very impressed with this large, bright barred spiral.  The halo is slightly elongated, ~3.5'x3.0' and sharply concentrated with a very bright, small, core.  A brighter bar oriented E-W extends through the center.  A star is superimposed on this bar to the west of the core.  A second superimposed star lies 35" to the south and continuing on this line is a third star just at the edge of the halo, 1.7' S of center.  At the east end of the bar a slightly enhanced arc sweeps clockwise to the north and a similar enhancement on the west side sweeps to the south.  The faint arc or arms wrap around 180° making a complete outer ring. The central bar and the outer ring together formed the Greek letter "Theta".  NGC 5643 is situated in a fairly rich Lupus star field.


18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fascinating glimpses of structure at 228x!  This galaxy was fairly bright and large, round, ~3.5' diameter.  The surface brightness was clearly patchy in the halo due to the strong impression of clockwise spiral structure but there was only a broad, weak concentration in the center, except for a sharply concentrated, bright 15" nucleus. A broad spiral arm is attached on the east side of the galaxy and shoots sharply to the north.  There was an impression of another spiral arm attached on the west side of the galaxy. It appeared to sweep towards the south in a clockwise orientation, though this structure was not as well defined.  A string of five stars angling SSE to NNW appear to puncture the galaxy on the south side with the northern two stars superimposed on the west side of the galaxy. The last star in the chain is just west of the nucleus.  Located in a star field densely peppered with stars.


13.1" (4/10/86): faint, diffuse, fairly small.  Two stars are superimposed on the south and SW side.

At his position in AN 1453 is a very faint star.  But Yann Pothier discovered in 2015 that Bond misidentified his offset star (#118 instead of #129) in Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol I, part II, p 282-3.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5655 = H III-645 = h1827 on 19 Mar 1787 (sweep 720) and recorded "eS, vS, lbM, between 2 vF stars with 300."  His offsets from Zeta Boo point directly to UGC 9333, the southeast of a 5.5' pair with NGC 5649, and his comment "between 2 vF stars" clinches this identification.


John Herschel observed the pair on 4 Apr 1831 (sweep 338) and called h1827 "the sf of 2 [with NGC 5649]; the faintest perceivable."  His uncertain position is 9 seconds of RA east and 3.5' south of UGC 9333.  He misassigned his father's III-645 to h1824 = NGC 5649 and thought h1827 = NGC 5655 was the "nova". JH was probably confused as neither of his poor positions for the pair were a good match with III-645. Dreyer repeated this error and used JH's poor position in the NGC.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 23 May 1887 (see IC2 Notes).


RNGC, UGC, MCG, RC3 and Deep Sky Field Guide misidentify NGC 5655 as NGC 5649.  RNGC and PGC misidentify PGC 51863 as NGC 5655.

George Bond discovered NGC 5658 = HN 13 = Au 35 on 26 Feb 1853, along with NGC 5632 and 5651, with the 15-inch Merz refractor during the Harvard Zone observations.  Auwers included this object in his 1862 table of new nebulae. There is nothing at Bond's discovery position in AN 1453 except an extremely faint star.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5665 = H II-27 = h1833 on 30 Jan 1784 (sweep 134) and recorded "a nebula following the large star under Bootis not marked in H."  Caroline added the comment in her sweep copy that "the nebula is pB and not very small; is not cometic; nor is it equally bright throughout, so that it is probably resolvable."  John Herschel made 2 observations and on 9 May 1828 (sweep 153) wrote, "pB; R; gbM; 30"."

Nearby stars make the view interesting; a mag 14 star is close off the east side and a mag 13.5 star (double) is at the west edge. A mag 8.2 star (HD 127923) is just 2.3' SW!

Truman Safford independently found this galaxy on 4 May 1886 with the 18.5-inch refractor at the Dearborn Observatory.  His RA was 1 minute too large (same error as IC 1026 = NGC 5653, found just a week later), so Dreyer assumed it was a new object and catalogued it as IC 1030. So, NGC 5672 = IC 1030.

NGC 5673 has similar dimensions and position angle as IC 1029 9.7' ESE but doesn't contain a bright core so is not nearly as prominent in the same field.  A mag 13.5 star is at the NW tip 1.1' from center.  IC 1029 = UGC 9361 appeared moderately bright, edge-on 5:1 NNW-SSE, 2.0'x0.4'.  Contains a very small and round prominent core with a faint stellar nucleus at moments.  Located 3.2' W of a mag 9.5 star.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5673 = h1838 on 13 May 1830 and recorded "vF; pmE; sf a star 15m."  He assumed h1838 was a reobservation of his father's II-696, a brighter edge-on 10' east-southeast (UGC 9361). JH used his position for II-696 in the GC and Dreyer copied this into the NGC.  In his 1912 Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer wrongly assumed that WH's position was incorrect: "the transit must have been entered 1 tmin too late".  Because of the error in the NGC position, when Bigourdan observed the pair on 14 Jun 1887, he assumed II-696 was new, measured an accurate position, and Dreyer catalogued it as IC 1029.


Harold Corwin feels it is wisest to keep NGC 5673 assigned to fainter UGC 9347, to conform to the current catalogues as well as the GC and NGC.  So, NGC 5673 = h1838 = UGC 9347 and IC 1029 = H II-696 = B. 185 = UGC 9361, an unusual situation in which an IC object was discovered by WH!  On the other hand, Malcolm Thomson argues NGC 5673 should apply to WH's II-696 = UGC 9361, though in this case UGC 9347 would not receive a NGC or IC number.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5694 = H II-196 = h3576 on 22 May 1784 (sweep 223) and recorded "pB, S, r, nearly R and bM.  It forms an arch, or very bright obtuse triangle with two stars very near and preceding it.  The arch is concave to the northeast and the two stars with the nebula are all within 5'."  John Herschel called the cluster "vB; pL; R; psbM; 1st class; 20"; r; several stars near."  His RA in the Cape Catalogue was 35 seconds too large.  Heinrich d'Arrest (who noticed the error) and Engelhardt measured accurate micrometric positions.


Announced as a globular cluster in the 1934 paper "Object NGC 5694 a Distant Globular Star Cluster" by Lampland and Clyde Tombaugh (1932AN....246..171L) at Lowell Observatory, based on photographic plates taken with the 13" Lowell telescope and followed up with the 42-inch reflector.  The large reflector clearly showed this was a condensed globular cluster.

On 6 May 1828 (sweep 151), John Herschel logged "vF, R, bM, follows an arc of 4 B stars."  The description is good, but his position (marked as very rough) is 30 sec of RA too large and 3.5' too far south.  Because of this error, the NGC RA is ~30 seconds too large, placing NGC 5697 south-southeast of NGC 5696 instead of southwest. Also as a result, Bigourdan thought his reobservation was a new object and NGC 5697 was catalogued again as IC 4471.

John Herschel found NGC 5704 = h1855 on 12 May 1828 and recorded "F, S, r."  He assumed this was a reobservation of his father's II-649 = UGC 9430, but his position is 5' northwest of the galaxy and corresponds (perhaps coincidentally) with a mag 14 star.  He also recorded the galaxy as well as h1859 (later NGC 5711), but assumed it was nova.  A second observation listed under h1855 matches UGC 9430, so NGC 5704 is perhaps a star (from the first observation) or a duplicate of NGC 5708 (from the second observation).


JH used the position from the first observation in the GC, so the NGC position for NGC 5704 is 5' off from the galaxy.  As a result, Reinmuth and Carlson reported NGC 5704 as nonexistent and modern catalogues identify the galaxy as NGC 5708.

He used this position in the GC and Dreyer copied it for the position of NGC 5704, so WH's number was associated with the wrong object (perhaps a star).  The same night JH logged h1859 = NGC 5708, and mistook it as a new discovery.


Reinmuth and Carlson reported NGC 5704 as nonexistent because of JH's misidentification and modern catalogues identify the galaxy as NGC 5708.  But clearly, NGC 5704 = NGC 5708. See Corwin's notes for more.

Arp 241, located 13' WNW, is a close encounter of two spiral galaxies with the interaction resulting in pair of opposing tidal tails forming a "sprinkler" appearance.  The two nuclei are separated by only 16" and were resolved at 375x.  The brighter and larger southeast component (VV 264a) appeared fairly faint, small, round, ~15" diameter, stellar or quasi-stellar nucleus.  The northwest component (VV 264b) is faint, very small, round, ~10" diameter, with a very small brighter nucleus.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 5709 = St XIII-79, along with NGC 5706 = St XIII-78, on 12 May 1883.  His position matches UGC 9435.  This galaxy was first discovered by WH nearly a 100 years earlier on 16 May 1784 and catalogued as H III-128 = NGC 5703, but the GC and NGC position is 1° too far south (clerical error).  So, NGC 5703 = NGC 5709.  NGC 5703 should be the primary designation because of the earlier discovery, but this galaxy is known as NGC 5709 because of the unambiguous position.

There is a mag 14.5 star just off the NE side 21" from center which confused the observation.  At moments, the compact core of the galaxy and the star appeared to form a faint double star.  I missed the faint extensions (arm) E-W on the POSS.  Forms a pair with NGC 5712 4.0' ESE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5712 = H III-950 on 20 Dec 1797 (sweep 1074) and recorded "vF, S, r.  It is preceded by a small patch of stars which appears almost like this nebula, but more resolved."  CH's position is 2.5' south and 25 sec of RA east of MCG +13-10-021 = PGC 51799.  MCG does not label this galaxy NGC 5712.


The "small patch of stars which appears almost like this nebula" in WH's description applies to IC 4470, situated 4' west-northwest, which was rediscovered by Bigourdan on 11 Jul 1887.  Interestingly, Bigourdan also calls it a star cluster: "Object which, at first sight, could be nebulous, but in which I suspect several stellar points.  It is therefore a cluster enveloped in nebulosity; it is vaguely elongated at 90 degrees and is 1' l and 40" wide."  Corwin and Steinicke both agree that WH should be credited with the discovery of IC 4470, although it did not receive a NGC designation.

R.J. Mitchell and George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 5724 on 16 Apr 1855.  Based on the sketch published in the 1880 monograph (showing (NGC 5714, 5717, 5721, 5722, 5723 and 5724), Harold Corwin identifies this number with MCG +08-27-016, an extremely compact galaxy or star.  The RNGC misidentifies 2MASX J14390847+4644487 as NGC 5724.  This galaxy is located about 4' NE of the trapezium formed by NGC 5721, NGC 5722, NGC 5723 and NGC 5724.


In an email exchange with Corwin, I suggested that NGC 5724 is actually a star based on its completely stellar appearance and SDSS classification.  Corwin concurs and the type has now been changed to a star in NED.  At B = 17.4, Corwin notes this is certainly one of the faintest NGC objects.

JH recorded from the Cape of Good Hope, "F; pL; pmE; gbM; with an appearance of resolvability, arising as I imagine from a few small stars accidentally on it, I hardly think it can be reckoned a cluster in the sense of class VI.

The identifications of these galaxies are reversed in the RNGC and CGCG due to this mix-up, although UGC, MCG and PGC have the correct identifications.  See Thomson's Catalogue Corrections and Corwin's notes.

48" (4/19/17): at 375x; gorgeous edge-on stretching nearly 7' NNW-SSE, It bulges nearly 1' in the core, though is much thinner towards the tips.  Contains an intensely bright, elongated core with a rounder nucleus.  The galaxy is sliced asymmetrically by a razor sharp, straight dust lane that splits the galaxy to the east of center, so that the main part of the galaxy is west of the dust lane.  The portion of the disc on the east side of the lane is much fainter but shows up well as a thin strip, mostly visible in the central section east of the main section of the core.  A bright mag 14 star is embedded on the south side, ~2' from the center.  A mag 15.1 star is near the NNW end, off the east side and a mag 16 star is just west of the very NNE tip.  Finally a mag 16+ star is superimposed just north of the core along the western flank ~0.6' from center.  The galaxy is located 20' WNW of 109 Vir (V = 13.7) and mag 8.5 HD 129827 is 5' NW.

18" (6/17/06): superb edge-on 7:1 N-S, ~6'x0.8', broadly concentrated to a 2'x0.7' elongated, bulging core.  The core is mottled and clumpy due to a dust lane that appears to pass along the east edge of the core.  The southern extension passes through a star and is slightly brighter and possibly longer, though the northern extension does extend as far with careful viewing (slightly lower surface brightness).


17.5" (2/28/87): beautiful edge-on ~N-S, bright, fairly large, 4.5'x0.7', small bright core.  A mag 15 star is at the south end 2' from the center.  A dust lane is evident as a sharp light cut-off along the eastern edge.  Located 5' SSE of mag 8.2 SAO 120633 and 20' WNW of 109 Virginis (V = 3.7).


William Herschel discovered NGC 5746 = H I-126 = h1874 on 24 Feb 1786 (sweep 532) and recorded "eB, mE in the parallel [should be in the meridian], BN, 8 or 9' long." John Herschel made the single observation "a long pB ray with a pB nucleus; 3' long."


Lord Rosse made an early observation with the 72" on 25 Apr 1848.  On 3 Apr 1875, Dreyer reported "there seems to be a split in the nebulosity following the nucleus."  This clearly refers to the dust lane.

WH probably discovered this object earlier on 16 May 1787 (sweep 738).  In his discovery of NGC 5754 = H III-687, he noted "Another much fainter and smaller suspected, about 2 [arcmin] more north.  300 shewed the same."

48" (4/19/17): Interesting face-on SBc spiral at 488x.  Contains a fairly bright, small oval core with a weak E-W bar.  A spiral arm is attached on the south side of the core and curls at least 90° counterclockwise towards the south and west, ending about 40" WNW of center.  A second arm is on the north side of the core but it was more difficult to distinguish as it wraps east tight to the core.  Finally, a fairly long, detached spiral arm of low surface brightness is on the southwest side of the halo, extending linearly WNW-ESE.  On the SDSS, this "arm" consists of a number of adjacent blue HII knots and angles towards companion NGC 5775. Two stars are superimposed north of center, one just 12" N and a mag 16 star 30" NE.


24" (7/14/15): at 375x; moderately to fairly bright, fairly large, slightly elongated NW-SE, 2.0'x1.5', slightly brighter middle, gradually increases towards the center.  Either contains a faint stellar nucleus or a faint star is superimposed near the center.  A mag 14 star is just off the northeast side, 1.4' from the center.  Forms a trio with NGC 5775 4.4' SE and IC 1070 6.3' SSE.


17.5" (4/13/91): fairly faint, moderately large, round, fairly low surface brightness, gradually brighter but no well-defined core.  A mag 14 star is off the NE edge 1.4' from center.  Forms a pair with NGC 5775 4.5' SE.


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 5774 on 26 Apr 1851.  While observing NGC 5775 he noted "[NGC 5775] is a long ray with another nebula [NGC 5774] about 3' preceding and a little north."  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position on two nights.

48" (4/19/17): very bright, large, very elongated 5:1 NW-SE, 4.0'x0.8', Contains a larger brighter middle section but no distinct nucleus.  A well defined, long thin dust lane slices through much of the galaxy, just east of center, though the contrast is less towards the outer portions.  The section west of the lane is considerably brighter and contains the main central section.  Overall, the galaxy has a very irregular surface brightness and is generally mottled.  The galaxy appears dusty with a lower surface brightness to the northwest of the central section and a knotty section is at the northwest end (identified as [LED2001] C in SIMBAD from the 2001 paper "NGC 5775: Anatomy of a disk-halo interface").  Similarly, there is a lower surface brightness region (dust) southeast of the central section and two very small HII knots near the southeast end (HII complex [LED2001] A).  NGC 5775 is the brightest and largest in a trio with NGC 5775 4.4' NW and IC 1070 4' SSW.


24" (7/14/15 and 6/23/17): at 375x; bright, fairly large, very elongated 4:1 NW-SE, 3.6'x0.9', slightly brighter elongated middle.  This edge-on has a mottled, dusty appearance.  A slightly brighter patch is at the southeast end (HII region "A" in "NGC 5775: Anatomy of a disk-halo interface").  Also, there appears to be a slightly brighter patch on the northwest side.  A mag 13.5 star lies 0.9' NE of center. Brightest in a physical trio with NGC 5774 4.4' NW and IC 1070 3.9' SSW.


17.5" (4/13/91): fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 3:1 NW-SE, weakly concentrated to a large elongated brighter central region.  A mag 13 star is just northeast of the core 0.9' from center.  Forms a pair with NGC 5774 4.5' NW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5775 = H III-554 = h1885 on 27 May 1786 (sweep 567) and recorded "vF, S, E from np to sf but nearly in the meridian."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5782 = Sw. VI-70 on 19 Apr 1887 and recorded "eF, vS, E, * nr sf".  There is nothing near his position, but 20 sec of RA further east and 9' north is UGC 9602.  Although this is a relatively large error for Swift, there is a star 45" southeast, matching Swift's description.  Bigourdan caught Swift's error and measured an accurate position on 31 May 1894.


If this identification is correct, then the RNGC, CGCG, MCG and PGC misidentify CGCG 076-094 = PGC 53322 as NGC 5782.  This galaxy (visually fainter than UGC 9602) was probably selected as it differs only in RA from Swift's original position.  This assignment, though, ignores Bigourdan's correction and fails to match Swift's comment about a star southeast.  I mentioned this error in RNGC Corrections #6.  See Corwin's identification notes (he concurs with my identification).

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5783 around 1887. The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer, who referenced his 6th discovery list, which was under preparation when the NGC was published.  But Swift didn't include it in either his 6th or later 9th list, which included several objects Swift discovered prior to the publication of the NGC.  This was one of six objects discovered by Swift that never appeared in his discovery lists.  Swift's position was 5 sec of RA west and 1.7' north of UGC 9586 and his description "pB, pS, iR, F* inv" applies.  List VI contains two nearby entries - NGC 5785 and NGC 5788, described as "np of 2" and "sf of 2".  NGC 5785 mentions a "F* close f", so appears to be a duplicate observation (or the same observation?) of UGC 9586 (the star is at the northeast end), though his RA is 30 sec too large (also off 2.6' in declination).  So, NGC 5785 = NGC 5783.

See observing notes for NGC 5783.  Uncertain identification.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5785 = Sw. VI-71, along with NGC 5788 = Sw. VI-72, on 21 Apr 1887 and recorded "vF; pS; F * close following; np of 2 [with NGC 5788].  His position is 30 sec of RA east and 3' north of UGC 9586, but his description is a reasonable match with a star on the northeast end of the central region.  The much fainter companion, NGC 5788, is situated 2.6' southwest, so his orientation is incorrect.


Furthermore, Swift communicated the discovery of a third nebula, NGC 5783, directly to Dreyer, which did not appear in either his 6th or 9th discovery lists.  The NGC position for NGC 5783 is within 2' of UGC 9586 and also mentions the nearby star.  So NGC 5783 = NGC 5785 may be the same observation (Swift may have manipulated the position) or the result of separate observations of this galaxy.

The identification of NGC 5795 with this galaxy is uncertain as Lewis Swift's position was 50'  to the south.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5795 on 24 Jun 1887 and communicated the discovery directly to Dreyer.  His description in list IX reads "vF; pS; eE; spindle; pB star close to p end; [NGC 5794/5804/5805] in field."  There are no good candidates near his position though 50' north is UGC 9617.  Corwin argues this galaxy (identified as NGC 5795 in RNGC and RC3) is correct based on Swift's description, although the "pB star" is at the following end.  UGC 9617 is not labeled NGC 5795 in the UGC, MCG and CGCG, but is taken as NGC 5795 in the RNGC.  See Corwin's notes.


Malcolm Thomson feels UGC 9617 is a very unlikely candidate due to large error in position (50') and that UGC 9626 is a more likely identification.  This galaxy is 10' east-northeast of Swift's position, but does not have a bright star nearby, so I don't agree with this assignment.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 5815 = LM 1-219 on 15 Feb 1886 and recorded "mag 15.0, 0.8' E 10°.  Faint double star(?) involved in neb."  His rough position is 1.2 minutes of RA east of MCG -03-38-044 and his position angle of 10° fits this galaxy.  Herbert Howe reported in his series of NGC observations in the late 1890's that "I could not find any nebula in the NGC place for this, but 100 seconds preceding was a nebula which answered the description of 5815, except that I saw no 'D * involved.'

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 5816 = LM 1-220, along with NGC 5817, in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  His description is "mag 11.0, 0.8' dia, gbMN, stellar."  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), though 2 min of RA west and 2.5' north is PGC 902544.  If this identification is correct, then NGC 5817, which Stone placed 4' south, applies to MCG -03-38-041 = PGC 53567.  The actual separation in declination is 5'.  But Stone's magnitude (11.0) would have to apply to MCG -03-38-041, which is about 1.5 magnitudes brighter than PGC 902544.  Herbert Howe searched for the pair around 1900, but only reported a position for NGC 5817, so he apparently missed PGC 902544 with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 5817 = LM 1-221, along with NGC 5816, in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory. He recorded "mag 14.0, 0.8' dia, gbMN, stell."  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), but 2.5 minutes of RA west is MCG -03-38-041.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 5819 on 6 Oct 1861 while searching for H III-311 [= NGC 5808] with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen. His position is off by 22 sec of RA (only 1.6' at this declination), but his comment "forms a triangle with two mag 11 stars" clinches this identification.   He noted this nebula was is the vicinity of H's object and questioned if it was identical.  It is, but WH's position was 1 min of time too far west and Dreyer assumed the two observations referred to different nebulae.  So, NGC 5819 = NGC 5808.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 11 Jul 1896. See notes for NGC 5808.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5820 = H II-756 = h1898 on 5 May 1788 (sweep 842) and recorded "cF, pL, iF, r."  His position is poor - about 7' southwest of UGC 9642.  JH called this object "B; R; sbM; precedes a splendid double star."  His position is just 1' north of center.  Because of his father's poor position, he assigned a separate GC designation to his object, but they were combined in the NGC.


Samuel Hunter observed NGC 5820 and 5821 on 29 Apr 1861 with the 72" and wrote, "[NGC 5820] is vB, E pf and has Nucl, about 2' ssf [of NGC 5820] is an eeF, S neb., 3' f [NGC 5820] is a F neb or possibly a D * [it is a double star]; 3 nf is a F, pL neb [NGC 5821], vgbM to a dull nucl."  At 1.7' SSE of NGC 5820 is SBS1457+540 = PGC 140436 at V = 15.7.  Although this galaxy is quite faint, it matches Hunter's position and within the magnitude range of the 72".  Dreyer added a note later that "the eeF neb would appear to be a nova", but perhaps because it wasn't confirmed on another observation he didn't include it in the NGC.

Bindon Stoney independently discovered this galaxy on 6 Apr 1851 at Birr Castle and JH assigned two GC designations to both observations but Dreyer combined these in the NGC.

NGC 5822 = Cr 289 = ESO 176-009

15 04 28 -54 23 24; Lup

Size 40'


22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): overfills the 110x (22 Panoptic) field of 37'.  Roughly 150 stars are resolved, most fairly similar in magnitude.  Many of the stars are notably arranged in long sprays and curving loops.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): excellent open cluster at 76x (27 Panoptic).  Appears very large, fairly rich, with the main body extended ~WNW-ESE and with dimensions  ~40'x25' with roughly 150 stars resolved.  The stars are fairly uniform in brightness (many mag 11 and 12) and convincingly arranged in loops and chains surrounded by voids.  The outline is quite irregular but well defined by the star chains around the periphery.  One chain detaches from the main group near the center and heads south and the outline tapers at the following end.  Easy in 10x30 IS binoculars, 7° NE of Alpha Centauri.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): roughly 60 stars mag 9-12 resolved at 63x.  Very large, 40' diameter, almost fills the low power field, elongated ~NW-SE.  Spread out with no central condensation.  Many stars have similar magnitudes.  The stars forming the borders are arranged in rows and arcs with many empty gaps inside this outline.  There is an extension of stars to the south.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5822 = h3588 on 3 Jul 1836 and recorded "cluster, vL, coarse, but rich and fine; diam in RA = 2 field in PD 25 (30' and 45'); stars 9, 10, 11, 12. General middle taken."  His position, though, is on the east side of the cluster. Megastar's position (following NGC 5823) is erroneous.


It seems surprising that James Dunlop (and Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille) missed this bright cluster.   But perhaps he didn't.  Glen Cozens reported a list of copying errors that Dunlop made between his notes and his published catalog.  In the case of Dunlop 357, he reported an RA of 14h 15m, but his handwritten notes show the RA is 14h 50m (for 1827).  This corrected RA lands on the west side of NGC 5822 and his description fits very well: "a very extensive cluster stars of mixed small magnitudes; the stars appear to be either congregating together in different parts of the cluster, or breaking up; there are several groups already formed, the whole cluster is composed of lines of stars, but no general attraction towards any particular point."

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a rich, fairly impressive cluster using the 27 Panoptic (76x) with at least 80 stars resolved in a 9'x7' area including numerous 11-13th magnitude stars.  A number of stars are bunched towards the center.  The periphery is well defined by curving sprays of stars roughly forming a heart-shape.  Two 10th magnitude stars mark the NW and SW corners of the cluster.  Perhaps 100-120 stars are resolved at 228x with a number of stars in pairs, trios, small groups, strings and arcs forming a very pretty cluster.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5823 = D 351 = h3589 on 8 May 1826 and described a "pretty large cluster of small stars resembling faint nebula, general figure round, south preceding 2 Pyxidis."  His position is 8' east of the center of the cluster.  JH made a single observation in Apr 1836 and noted "Cluster class VII; a fine large cluster of separate stars 13..14th mag, 10' diameter; not much compressed in the middle; nearly fills the field."  Neither JH nor Dreyer credited Dunlop with the discovery.

V = 8.0;  Size 6.2';  Surf Br = 0.4


17.5" (6/3/00): moderately bright globular, small, ~2.5' diameter.  It contained a sharply concentrated 1' core that was very prominent, surrounded by a symmetric 2.5' halo.  I didn't see any definite resolution at 500x although the halo was mottled and one or two "sparkles" were glimpsed (one at the SE end of halo).


8" (6/27/81): small, bright core.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5824 = D 611 on 14 May 1826 and reported "a very singular body resembling a star with a burr.  The light is equal to that of a star of the 7th and 8th magnitude, and the diameter is not sensibly larger, with various magnifying powers.  This has the appearance of a bright nucleus, surrounded by a strong brush of light; and the nebulosity surrounding the bright point has not that softness which nebulae in general possess.  I consider this different from nebulae in general."  Dunlop's position was off by nearly 30' in RA (too far west) and he wasn't credited with the discovery in the NGC.


John Herschel next discovered this globular on 9 May 1834, but his position for h1900 (later NGC 5834) was poor.  E.E. Barnard independently NGC 5824 in 1882 with his 5-inch refractor in Nashville.  In AN 2756, he gave an accurate micrometric position and mentions "this nebula is recorded in GC 4036 [= NGC 5834] as eeF?  I have frequently seen it since 1882.  Presuming that the nebula observed by me is identical with GC 4036, the place in GC, as well as the description is erroneous."  In Sidereal Messenger, vol. 5, p.255, he also gave a corrected position and described this globular (through the 6" Cooke refractor) as "B; S; R; vvmbM; probably a stellar nucleus."


Despite Barnard's corrected position and description, Dreyer assigned two numbers (NGC 5824 and 5834) to Barnard's and John Herschel's observations. But Barnard's assumptions were likely correct and NGC 5824 = NGC 5834, with the primary designation NGC 5824 (due to the unambiguous position).  In the IC 1 Notes and Corrections, Dreyer comments "NGC 5834 to be struck out, is = NGC 5824." See identification notes on NGC 5834 and Harold Corwin's comments for more on this story.


In 1924 Robert Innes announced NGC 5824 was a globular cluster, based on his observation his observation with the 26.5-inch refractor at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg.  He reported "it has almost exactly the appearance of 47 Tucanae as seen in a small telescope.  It is a very condensed globular cluster, its outliers resolved into stars."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5825 = Sw. IV-16 on 20 Jun 1886 and recorded "eeF; pS; lE; pB star close f; easily overlooked."  There is nothing near his position.  Bigourdan was unable to locate a candidate and RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent.


Interestingly, his description for NGC 5825 is nearly identical to NGC 5778 (which also mentions a "pB star close f"), found by Swift on the same night, and their declinations are similar.  But his RA for NGC 5825 is 7 min 40 sec too large.  Corwin mentions the possibility Swift made an error and recorded NGC 5778 twice, botching the RA for NGC 5825.  Otherwise, NGC 5825 appears to be lost.

Two other members of HCG 73 were visible; IC 4526 1.4' NW and HCG 73C 2.4' NE.  The latter galaxy appeared extremely faint and small, 10" diameter.  The mag 16.2 star is at the midpoint of NGC 5829 and HCG 73C.


18" (8/4/05): the brightest member in HCG 73 appeared faint, small, slightly elongated 4:3, ~0.6'x0.45', low surface brightness with very little concentration.  Located 1.2' E of a mag 12 star and a mag 14 star lies a similar distance east.


Forms a close pair with IC 4526 = HCG 73B 1.3' NW.  IC 4526 appeared extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter.  Forms the northern vertex of an equilateral triangle with sides of 1' with NGC 5829 and a mag 12 star.  Once this difficult galaxy was noticed, it was visible most of the time using averted vision and concentration at 225x.  The pair forms Arp 42 ("spiral with LSB companion on arm").  The redshift of NGC 5829, though, is less than half that of HCG 73B, C and D, so is a foreground object.


17.5" (7/8/94): fairly faint, slightly elongated 4:3 E-W, 1.2'x0.9', very weak concentration, irregular or mottled surface brightness.  Located between a mag 11.5 star just off the west edge 1.2' from center and a mag 13.5 star 1.3' ESE of center.  This is the brightest member of HCG 73.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 5829 = St XII-68 on 11 May 1882.  His position matches UGC 9673, the brightest member of HCG 73.  The RA in the RNGC is 1.0 min of time too large.  The UGC incorrectly equates IC 4526 with NGC 5829, but IC 4526 is a separate galaxy close northwest.


Edwin Hubble, in the 1920 published version of his PhD dissertation "Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae", noted "IC 4526 is connected to NGC 5829. The two form a double nebula fashioned as a miniature of Messier 51.”  That bridge is illusionary, though, as IC 4526 lies far in the background (redshift over twice that of NGC 5829) and there is no physical connection.

John Herschel found NGC 5834 = h1900 on 9 May 1834 and recorded "a very strongly suspected nebula; but I cannot be quite sure (from the low altitude [of 6°]) it is not a star."  There is nothing at his position, but 30' west is the globular cluster NGC 5824 [discovered earlier by Dunlop in 1826 and independently found by Barnard], which would have appeared quite faint and poorly defined at this altitude.

Albert Marth found NGC 5841 = m 286 on 12 Apr 1864 and noted "F, S, E."  There is nothing at his position but 1.0 min of RA east and 1' north is NGC 5848, discovered two years earlier by Heinrich d'Arrest.  So, NGC 5841 is likely a duplicate observation of this galaxy.  Based on photographs with the Crossley reflector at Lick in 1912-13, Heber Curtis selected  LEDA 1215798 as a possible candidate, but this galaxy is certainly too faint to have been picked up by Marth.  Karl Reinmuth reported NGC 5841 was not found on Heidelberg plates and Dorothy Carlson and the RNGC repeated this conclusion.

Using this combination, the planetary appeared moderately bright and large with an irregular shape and surface brightness, but elongated ~0.9'x0.7' WSW-ENE, .  At 228x, the northeast end is brighter and larger and the center seems pinched in, particularly on the north side with a small, faint extension or knot on the southwest end.  Unfiltered at 228x, a fairly close double (B 832 = 9/10.5 at 5") lies 3' NE and a very close, faint double lies 1.3' SE of center.  Located 3° ENE of mag 3.2 Alpha Circini.

Set in a rich Triangulum Australe star field 3' SW of a mag 9 double star (9/10.5 at 6").  Also a mag 10.5 star lies 2.5' E.


This object is listed in the PK and ESO-Strausberg catalogues as He 2-119 instead of NGC 5844 although John Herschel's position (from two observations) matches this planetary.  Also, it was listed as an unverified southern object in the RNGC and probably because of this error was not included in Sky Atlas 2000.0, Sky Catalogue 2000.0 or the first edition of the Uranometria 2000!

William Herschel discovered NGC 5846 = H I-128 = h1901, along with NGC 5845, on 24 Feb 1786 (sweep 532) and recorded "vB, pL, bM. With one preceding [NGC 5845] just [at edge of field]; and 5' more north, and vF, R.  I saw also a third small one preceding."  The "third small one preceding" might refer to NGC 5839, which has a separate log entry or Wolfgang Steinicke suggests it might apply to NGC 5846A, the very close companion on its south side.  On 13 Apr 1838, John Herschel logged "B; R; psbM to nucleus; 30" [diameter]."


John Herschel's first observation of NGC 5846 was on 29 May 1821 while being instructed on sweeping techniques by his elderly father.  His Aunt Caroline recorded the observation: "F; R; gmbM; resolvable; appears to have 2 nuclei; south following in the same field is a very small, round nebula."  James South also took a look and exclaimed (quoted in JH's journal), "O! Good God!  It is worth going to the devil for!  The second nuclei is NGC 5846A.  This short sweep (4 objects) was later registered out of order as sweep 53.   He observed NGC 5846 again the next night (sweep 54) and noted "The neb of last night with the 2 nuclei."  Guillaume Bigourdan also resolved the companion and noted Big. II-75 as "round, stellar centre, forms a very close companion to 4045 G.C. [NGC 5846]."


In addition, Edward Burton, observing with LdR's 72" on 25 Apr 1868, logged "h1901 [NGC 5846] is double, 3rd Nucleus suspected on n side."  The third nucleus is a faint star.  On 3 May 1877 Dreyer also noted "companion nebula [to NGC 5846] vS, less than 1' south."  But the following year he commented "small star (NOT a nebula) involved south."  This was likely the reason Dreyer did not enter NGC 5846A into the NGC. DeVaucouleurs introduced the NGC 5846A designation in the RC I.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5856 = H IV-71 = h1904 = HD 134064 on 24 May 1791 (sweep 1006) and recorded "a star 7.6m, enveloped in extensive milky neby; but I am not sure whether there many not be a perception till I have another star of about the same size."  A little later in the sweep he noted another star 7m "perfectly free from any nebulosity, so that the foregoing star must certainly be involved in extensive nebulosity; probably unconnected with the star."  JH commented "A star of fully 6m, with a supposed nebulous appearance about it, but of whose reality I cannot satisfy myself, as it 'blinks' with the star behind the wire."  As JH suspected, this star is free of nebulosity.


R.J. Mitchell, observing at Birr Castle on 10 May 1855 agreed that the "atmosphere seems to exist" and on 1 Apr 1878 Dreyer noted "*6m; seemed nebulous, but it is doubtful, eyepiece inclined to dew."  Dreyer mentioned in the IC 1 notes that "no nebulosity seen by Bigourdan".  Father Hagen also found "no neb around *6.1" in the Vatican Zone Catalogue.

NGC 5869 = UGC 9742 = PGC 54119 (the southern galaxy) was originally discovered on 24 Feb 1786, but WH was confused which one was new and mistakenly assigned II-684 to NGC 5869 instead of NGC 5865.  This caused later confusion.


NGC 5868, found by d'Arrest on 27 Apr 1882, is a reobservation of NGC 5865.  JH thought it was new and assigned it a GC designation because of the difference in position.  Dreyer concluded NGC 5865 = NGC 5868 in his 1912 update of WH's catalogues as JH and Birr Castle only reported two nebulae.  By earlier discovery NGC 5865 should apply to PGC 54118 but it is known as NGC 5868.  RNGC misidentifies NGC 5869 as NGC 5865.

48" (4/21/17): at 488x and 697x; spectacular lenticular (S0/a) with a razor-thin dust lane perfectly bisecting the galaxy. Overall the galaxy is extremely bright, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, roughly 4'x1.35'.  The main spindle contains an intensely bright, bulging oval core that is nearly perfectly bisected by an extremely narrow dust lane.  The outer portion of the halo has a low surface brightness and increases in size with averted vision.  A mag 11.3 star is at the northwest edge of the halo and a mag 12.2 star is just off the southwest side, 1.4' from center.  Also a mag 15.5 star is superimposed on the northwest halo [1.6' from center].  NGC 5867, one of the faintest in the NGC, lies 2' SE.  SDSS J150631.55+554348.9, an 18th magnitude galaxy, was marginally glimpsed 2.0' SSE of center.


24" (7/6/13): at 200x appeared extremely bright, large, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, spindle shaped, well concentrated with a blazing oval core.  A very thin, low contrast dust lane bisects the galaxy and is most evident along the central bulging core.  The outer halo is much fainter and extends ~3.25'x1.25'.  A mag 11.3 star is just off the NW flank, 1.6' from center and a mag 12.2 star is off the SW side 1.4' from center.  At 322x, NGC 5867 was picked up 1.0' SSE of the mag 12.2 star as a very faint 8" glow, held continuously with averted vision.  NGC 5866B, situated 47' E, appeared faint, ~1' in diameter, slightly elongated N-S, very low surface brightness.  Seems to have a small slightly brighter central region.


17.5" (6/6/86): very bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 3.0'x1.5', bulging bright core.  This galaxy has a high surface brightness and a mottled surface.  Just a hint of the razor-thin dust lane prominent on photographs is visible.  A mag 11.5 star is at the NW end 1.6' from the center and a slightly fainter mag 12 star is 1.5' SW.  Located 10' NE of mag 7.5 SAO 29401.


13" (6/4/83): very bright, impressive, large bright core, two stars off the NW and SW edges.  A mag 7 star is 10' SW.


8" (6/4/83): fairly bright, brighter central bulge, fainter extension.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5866 = H I-215 = h1909 on 5 May 1788 (sweep 842) and recorded "vB, cL, E, following 2 stars."  His position is poor - nearly 6' southwest of the galaxy.  NGC 5866 is likely an edge-on S0 galaxy with a dust lane.


NGC 5866 was first observed by Lord Rosse on 27 Apr 1848 and described as "A very bright resolvable nebula, but none of the component stars seen distinctly even with a power of a thousand.  A perfectly straight and longitudinal division in the direction of the major axis."  George Johnstone Stoney's (Lord Rosse's assistant) sketched the galaxy and dust lane on 27 Apr 1849 (plate XXXVII, figure 8, 1850 publication).


This galaxy is sometimes taken as M102 for completeness of the Messier catalogue.  Pierre Méchain found M102 on 27 Mar 1781, but in a letter dated 6 May 1783 to Johann Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch, he stated M101 and 102 "are nothing but the same nebula, which has been taken for two, by an error in the charts."  But in the September 2015 issue of Sky & Tel, Michael Covington argues that Mechain probably did see NGC 5866, along with the adjacent 7th-magnitude star and Messier may have confirmed the observation.  See Harold Corwin's notes for a more detailed analysis of M102.

18" (7/13/07): after a couple of failed attempts I picked up this extremely faint companion located 2' S of center to NGC 5866 and 1' SE of a mag 12 star.  I first took a look in Alvin Huey's 22" to check the relative position and appearance. Then in my Starmaster at 262x I glimpsed an extremely faint, barely non-stellar knot, ~6" diameter, that required averted and was only visible for moments at a time.  The observation was repeatable, though, and confirmed in excellent conditions at the Lassen Peak parking lot.


George Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 5867 on 25 Apr 1851.  While observing NGC 5866 he noted "alpha [on field sketch] is an eeF neb."  The sketch clearly points to NGC 5867 = 2MASX J15062441+5543543.  Four years later (13 Apr 1855), R.J. Mitchell recorded "the nova alpha seems to a real neb."

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 5871 around 1882 while observing NGC 5865 and NGC 5869.  In the narrative section of list V, he claims he made a sketch of four close nebula forming a trapezoid with a diagonal of 4' and the smallest side of 2.5'.  But there are only the two NGC galaxies here, so his other two objects must refer to faint stars.  The NGC position (communicated directly to Dreyer) is between two mag 15-16 stars to the southeast of NGC 5865.  Harold Corwin lists both stars in his table, with the brighter western star given here as a more likely candidate.  See Corwin's notes for more.

Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 5873 on 2 May 1883 near Lake Titicaca using a 6.1" refractor with a direct vision Vogel-spectroscope.  The position given in Copernicus III (1884) is 8 sec of RA too far west and 2' north.  This was the first deep sky object to be discovered in South America.  Copeland discovered three NGCs in the Andes using this visual spectroscopy including NGC 5315, just two nights later.

His rough position (nearest min of RA) is 1.0 min of RA west and 3' north of MCG -02-39-012 = PGC 54427.  As this galaxy is 3' northwest of NGC 5883, the identification is reasonable.


Because of Leavenworth's poor position, there's been confusion on the identification.  The Helwan Observatory bulletin #38 for 1935 misidentified  MCG -02-39-010 as NGC 5880.  This galaxy is 12' due north of the NGC position but doesn't match being "in field with [NGC 5883]."  It is in the field of NGC 5878 instead.

William Herschel discovered NGC 5881 = H II-818 on 26 Apr 1789 (sweep 930) and noted "pF, cL, R, vgbM."  CH's reduced position is 52 sec of RA east and 2' south of UGC 9729.  Dreyer notes in the 1912 "Scientific Papers", that the listed RA in GC and NGC was 2 tmin too large (the actual error is ~ 2 min 45 sec).  Because of this error, Bigourdan and d'Arrest were unable to locate NGC 5881.


Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy (list IX-45) on 22 Jun 1889 and logged "vF; pS; lE; bet 2 stars."  Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 1100, but noted in the "Scientific Papers" that "II-818 is probably = IC 1100."


The RNGC misidentifies UGC 9764 as NGC 5881.  This galaxy is over two degrees from the NGC position.  UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 all label this galaxy as IC 1100 (because of the unambiguous position) instead of NGC 5881.  I wrote up this case in RNGC Corrections #6 and it is discussed in Corwin's notes.

It has no 'satellites'.  My attendant [John Stone], to whom I showed it, said it was like the moon, only smaller, and not in the least like a star."  His sketch is on Plate VI, figure 8.   The planetary was also sketched by both Joseph Turner and Pietro Baracchi using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished Plate V, figure 56 and Plate VII, figure 71).


Duncker independently found the planetary on an objective prism plate at Harvard's Arequipa station and Williamina Fleming announced it was new in 1884.

There is nothing near his rough position (nearest min of RA).  The RNGC identified MCG -02-39-007 = PGC 54365 as NGC 5892.  This galaxy is nearly 3 minutes of RA west (not an uncommon error) as well as 30' south of Stone's position, but his description (especially size) does match this galaxy.  Not surprisingly, due to the poor NGC positional match, Fath (see below), Shapley-Ames, Helwan observatory, MCG and RC2 failed to label this label this galaxy as NGC 5892. The Helwan observatory 1935 bulletin stated NGC 5892 was "not shown with 80 min exposure."


Edward Fath catalogued it as #703 in his 1914 paper "A study of nebulae", which included 864 new "nebulae" discovered on plates taken with the 60-inch at Mt. Wilson.  Fath gave the dimensions as 2'16" x 2'16" and noted it was a spiral. The designation Fath 703 was used in the 1932 "Shapley-Ames Catalogue" of 1249 objects brighter than 13th photographic magnitude as well as in Sandage and Tammann's 1981 revised version.  Due to the 30' discrepancy in declination and lack of a sketch, the identification of Fath 703 with NGC 5892 is uncertain but adopted in NED, HyperLEDA and SIMBAD.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 5895, along with NGC 5896, on 23 May 1854 while observing NGC 5893 at Birr Castle.  He noted "about 3' nf [of NGC 5893] is a small nebula [NGC 5895], lE, vF with a third vvF neb [NGC 5896] close north; I suspect the two novae to be connected, as they are very close, and the n one exactly in a line with the axis of the small one.  2 stars close sf the novae, the f being vS."  The description and diagram clearly identifies the two small galaxies.  The CGCG lists a single entry for NGC 5895 + 5896 with a combined magnitude of 15.5.

18" (7/11/07): this low surface brightness globular was easily picked up 12.5x in the 80mm finder as a small, faint, hazy knot.  Excellent view at 225x in the 18" with 60-70 stars resolved and a very weak concentration and no distinct core.  At 325x, 90-100 stars were resolved over an 11' diameter though the halo does not have a well defined edge so the count is somewhat arbitrary.  The hazy background glow of unresolved star is quite lively and irregular in surface brightness.


17.5" (6/3/00): large, loose, globular, ~10' in diameter with only a weak concentration and no core.  At 280x, 60-70 stars are resolved in good moments of seeing and many appear to be arranged in strings (two on the east side of the halo) emanating from the central region.  The extent of the halo is ill-defined.


17.5" (6/6/86): this is a low surface brightness globular of 10' diameter with little concentration.  Roughly circular although the outline is irregular.  Well resolved into 50 stars at 286x over haze although NGC 5897 is too large for a good view at high power.  About 5' NNE of center is a string of three mag 11.5, 12 and 14 stars with a total length of 1.4'.


13.1" (6/30/84): about two dozen faint stars resolved over irregular haze.


13.1" (6/19/82): a number of faint stars resolved over a larger region of haze.


12x80 (6/30/84): very faint but visible in the finder!


William Herschel discovered NGC 5897 = H VI-19 = H VI-8 = h3596 on 25 Apr 1785 (sweep 209) and recorded VI-8 as "a very close compressed cluster of stars, 8 or 9' in diameter, extr rich, of an iR figure, a little E.  The stars so small as hardly to be visible so accumulated in the middle as to look nebulous."  There is nothing at his position and Dreyer chronicled the problems in the sweep in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel".


Harold Corwin has an extensive discussion and argument that H VI-8 = NGC 5897.  WH rediscovered this cluster a couple of weeks later on 10 Mar 1785 (sweep 383) and recorded VI-19 as "A beautiful L cluster of the most minute and most compressed stars imaginable.  Different sizes and a faint red colour perceivable."  His position on this sweep was only 3' south of center.


In 1914, Hardcastle classified NGC 5897 as a known spiral nebula (based on ?).  The following year, Knox-Shaw reported it was a loose globular cluster and "certainly no a spiral nebula", based on a photograph taken between 1912-14 at the Helwan Observatory with the Reynolds reflector.

JH made two observations and measured an accurate RA.  The observation at Birr Castle on 25 Apr 1849 mentions "Dark space nf nucleus??"  The dark space is a gap between the core and the spiral arm on the north following end of the galaxy.

Strong even concentration to a large very bright core.  Third best globular cluster from northern California (5th brightest integrated magnitude) and can be glimpsed naked-eye in as a small fuzzy glow in dark skies.  Located 22' NW of 5 Serpentis (∑1930 = 5.2/10.2 at 11") and the star is more prominent than the globular.

Naked-eye (7/26/06): M5 was just visible naked-eye but the nearby mag 5 star (5 Ser) detracts from the observation.  The globular appears as a faint, very small fuzzy glow close NW of the star.


Naked-eye (1/21/12): confirmed naked-eye from Mauna Kea visitor center though the nearby mag 5 star is much more prominent.


Gottfried and Maria Kirch discovered M5 = NGC 5904 = h1916 on 5 May 1702.   Maria's diary (translated by Leos Ondra) mentions "By such searching [for the comet then visible] my husband found by this with just this 3 Sch. tube, high over Mu [Serpentis] a nebulous light, it had many other fine stars around it, but one stood particularly by the tube above it about thus: [sketch follows]."   Charles Messier independent found it on 23 May 1764.


William Herschel's first observation using his 6.2-inch (7-ft telescope) was on 4 Mar 1783: "It consists of stars; they are however so small that I can but just perceive some, and suspect others. 1810 (power?), the globular figure is visible."  Using his 18.7" on 5 May 1785 (sweep 409) he recorded, "a very compressed very beautiful, and large cluster of small stars of various sizes, and of a red colour.  For about 2 or 2.5' they are extremely compressed in the center; and the pretty regularly scattered stars extend to about 7 or 8' diam."  Then there are besides many more irregularly scattered at a greater distance; especially one branch, which extends in a direction of about 15 or 20 degrees sp and some of the stars of this branch are rather larger than the rest."  On 24 Feb 1787, he logged "The most beautiful, extremely compressed cl of small stars; the greatest part of them gathered together into one brilliant nucleus; evidently consisting of stars, surrounded with many detached gathering stars of the same size and colour."


While being instructed by his father on his first sweep of 29 May 1821, John Herschel logged, "a most beautiful cluster, vmbM, very compressed, round, the stars various sizes scattered."  The sweep was later numbered 53, out of date.  His regular sweeps began in 1825.

NGC 5905 and 5908 were observed at Birr Castle on 13 Apr 1850 and assumed to be novae, so John Herschel assigned a separate General Catalog designation (4084).

William Herschel discovered NGC 5907 = H II-759 = h1917 on 5 May 1788 (sweep 842) and recorded "pB; 8 or 10' long, 1.5' or 2' broad, FNM."  On sweep 347, JH logged "B; a superb ray nebula, at least 7.5' long and narrow, pos = 159.9° by meas; at first vgb, then psmbM."


George Stoney was the first to note the dust lane on 13 Apr 1850 at Birr Castle.  He described a "very remarkable ray, 12' or 15' long; alpha, beta, gamma and delta are stars, of which alpha is faint; a longitudinal split precedes the nucleus." A faint star was sketched within the portion to the west of the dust lane. The dust lane was confirmed on 13 Apr 1855.  On 23 Apr 1860, Samuel Hunter described "south-preceding nucleus there is a dark space with vF neby beyond, & south-following nucleus is rather dark with a portion much brighter beyond, then another dark space and again neby."  The faint portion of the galaxy preceding the dust lane was catalogued as GC 4086 = NGC 5906.

24" (7/18/17): NGC 5910 is a triple system consisting of HCG 74A (middle), 74B (south) and 74C (northeast).  The main galaxy appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 20" diameter, slightly brighter nucleus.  HCG 74B, just 20" SE at the edge of the halo, appeared faint (visible continuously), very small, round, 10"-12" diameter.  HCG 74C, only 18" separation at the NE edge of the halo, appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter.   The combined glow of the three galaxies spanned ~50" SSW-NNE.  HCG 75D is 1.8' S and appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 8" diameter.  A mag 14.5/14.5 double [18" separation] is 1' W.


18" (8/4/05): at first glace this appeared to be a fairly faint, fairly small glow, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 0.6'x0.3', with a knotty appearance and brighter on the north end.  With careful viewing at 225x, this glow was resolved into two nearly tangent knots.  The larger and much brighter glow at the north end was HCG 74A and appeared fairly faint, small, round, 25" diameter.  Barely off the SSW end was a nearly stellar knot, HCG 74B. A close pair of mag 14-14.5 stars that are collinear with the galaxy is just 1.3' W and two mag 11 stars to the north are also collinear with the galaxy.  HCG 75 lies just 35' NE!


17.5" (7/8/94): brightest member of HCG 74.  Fairly faint, small, round, 30" diameter, weak concentration.  The observation is confused by a companion (HCG 74B) that is attached at the SSW end, just 20" between centers.  HCG 74B popped into view with averted vision and looked like a knot at the edge.  A faint mag 14/14 double star close west is collinear and a mag 13 star is 3' WSW.  UGC 9813 lies 8.0' SW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5910 = H II-400 on 13 Apr 1785 (sweep 399) and noted "F, pL, easily resolvable."  On 28 Apr 1788 (sweep 835) he logged "eF, vS, may be a few stars."  He position is pretty accurate, though.  Neither JH nor d'Arrest made an observation of this galaxy (brightest in HCG 74).

On continued observation, the galaxy resolves into a second and possibly a third member very close that pops into view momentarily.  It was very difficult, though, to view these simultaneously.  One of these glows might be CGCG 049-144, which is 1.2' ENE of NGC 5919.  Forms a group (MKW 3s) along with brighter NGC 5920 4' ESE.  The POSS reveals six faint galaxies within 2' of this galaxy!

The central 1.25' bar was easily visible extending SSW-NNE, and displayed a pretty even surface brightness.  A fairly low contrast circular ring was visible enclosing the bar and nucleus.  The northern spiral arm was attached at the north end of the bar and curled clockwise, extending west for ~1.5'.  A prominent southern arm was fairly straight as it extended 1.25' ESE from the south end of the bar (at a right angle).  The diffuse eastern part of the halo had a low, but irregular surface brightness.  A mag 12.0 star is at the southwest side, 1.2' from center and a mag 10.3 star is 2.9' SE.  A curve of stars extends directly south of the galaxy and a number of stars are close west.


UGC 9830, located 36' SSE, appeared  faint, fairly large, extremely thin edge-on, ~10:1 SW-NE, ~1.5''x0.15', very low nearly even surface brightness.  A mag 13.6 star is attached at the east edge near the center and detracts from viewing.

A slightly brighter bar (fairly low contrast) extends SSW to NNE.  The very beginning of a spiral arm is evident as an elongated glow at the north end of the bar, extending a very short distance to the northwest.  The view was improved at 385x with a strong hint of a second spiral arm beginning at the south end of the bar and starting to bend east. Contains a bright, sharp stellar nucleus.  A mag 10 star is 3' SE and a mag 12 star is at the southwest edge.


17.5" (7/16/93): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 3:2 N-S, 2.0'x1.4', small bright core dominates, stellar nucleus.  Located 2.9' WNW of a mag 9.5 star.  A mag 12 star is just at the SW edge 1.1' from center.  This star is at the end of a distinctive arc of four mag 11-12 stars leading to the galaxy on the south side.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5921 = H I-148 = h1919 on 1 May 1786 (sweep 561) and recorded "cB, cL, bM, iR.  Stars scattered over and about it; not belonging to it."  His position is accurate.  On 17 Apr 1855, LdR's assistant R.J. Mitchell, logged "suspect spiral like an 'S'.  Mr J. Stoney saw the np branch with considerable certainty, the sf one not so sure."


A photograph (3-hour exposure) with the Crossley reflector was included in the October 1912 Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Curtis described NGC 5921 as a "very interesting spiral.  Fairly strong nucleus, about which is an oval 1.8' long, whose longer axis is crossed by a straight lane of matter; from the ends of this oval spring the two main whorls of the spiral; other fainter whorls are visible."

William Herschel discovered NGC 5922 = H III-661 = h1921 on 9 Apr 1787 (sweep 725) and logged "eF, S."  His position is 6' south and 10 sec of RA east of UGC 9823 - a comparable offset to several previous objects in the sweep.  Because of WH's poor position and perhaps the comment "small", JH assumed he discovered the galaxy and reported h1921 as a "Nova" at the correct position.  So, NGC 5922 = NGC 5923.  RNGC classifies this number as a star.


JH discovered h1922 on 6 May 1828, though he assumed it was his father's H III-661.  No measured RA is given (just WH's rough RA) and the declination is 4' south of NGC 5923.  Close to JH's offset in declination is a 17" pair of mag 16 stars, and JH possibly glimpsed these stars (he gave no description).

John Herschel found NGC 5923 = h1921 on 6 May 1828 and logged "F; pL; lE; vgbM."  JH made a total of 4 observations (including sweep 151), with size estimates of 40" and 60".  Because of his father's poor position for NGC 5922 = H III-661, he assumed his observation was new and reported it as a "Nova".  So, NGC 5922 = NGC 5923.  By historical precedence, the primary designation should be NGC 5922, but this galaxy is known as NGC 5923 due to the unambiguous position.


On sweep 151, he also made an observation of what he assumed was H III-661 at ~4' south of the NGC 5923.  Close to this position is a 17" pair of 16 mag stars.  This is perhaps what JH took for H III-661, though there is no description and perhaps h1922 is just a empty placeholder for his father's number.  See Corwin's identification notes for more.

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): at 110x appears as a large, fairly rich cluster of ~150 stars mag 11 to 14 in a 25'x12' group (roughly rectangular) elongated SSW to NNE.  Not concentrated and without any distinctive rich clumps, though many stars forming small subgroups.  Situated in a rich region of the Milky Way and not distinguishable at moderate power but fairly detached using low power.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5925 = h3603 on 28 Jul 1826 and recorded "a most numerous and beautiful milky way group or cluster covering a space of 1.5 or 2 fields diameter (20' or 30') entirely composed of double and triple stars, and distinct groups of 4 or 5 nearly of a size (10th and 11th mag) on a black ground. Perhaps 100 or 150 stars in field."  The next night he logged "a remarkable cluster, 20' diameter, R, very discrete, and composed of small groups of 2, 3, 4 stars, chiefly 11, 12 and 13th mag, sufficiently insulated from the rest of the pretty rich neighbourhood to be considered a cluster."


JH credited James Dunlop with the discovery (D 357), but Dunlop's position is a much better fit with NGC 5593 and an hour off in time from NGC 5925.  Dreyer associated D 357 with both NGC 5593 and NGC 5925 in the NGC, so there was clearly some confusion.

At 228x, at least three dozen mag 14-15.5 stars are resolved and the core is very lively and granulated. I had the strong impression that it was on the verge of more extensive resolution.  A mag 10 star lies 4.5' due south of center with a mag 11 star 3' NW.  The halo extends to nearly the line connecting these two stars. NGC 5927 forms a pair with globular NGC 5946 just over a degree following within Norma.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): moderately bright, fairly small, 4' diameter, round, gradually increases to bright core, lively but no resolved.  Fainter gc NGC 5946 is 70' E.  Viewed at only 14° elevation from Baja.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5927 = D 389 = h3604 on 8 May 1826 and describing it (based on 8 observations) as "a very fine round pretty bright nebula, about 3' diameter, gradually brighter towards the centre, and well defined at the margin: this is resolvable. With a power of 260 it has a beautiful globular appearance. The stars are considerably scattered on the south side."  John Herschel  described it on 7 Jul 1834 as "globular, B, L, R, gbM, diam in RA = 16 seconds. Comes up to a bright blaze in middle. Resolved by left eye. Stars 17th mag."  On a later sweep he called it "globular, pB, fine highly condensed, vgbM, 3' diameter, clearly resolved. I see all the stars (15th mag) well."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 5941 = Sw. VI-83, along with NGC 5940/42/44, on 19 Apr 1887 and recorded "eeeF; S; R; ee diff; 2nd of 4."  NGC 5941/42/44 refer to 3 of the 4 members of HCG 76.  Unfortunately his positions were not accurate enough to easily pin down the identities.  Modern catalogues identify NGC 5941 = HCG 76C, NGC 5942 = HCG 76D and NGC 5944 = HCG 76A.  That leaves HCG 76B without an NGC number, although visually I found it the most prominent in the group visually, so Swift would not have likely missed it.


Based on correspondence with Corwin, he agrees that NGC 5941 = HCG 76B, and all modern catalogues are incorrect.  Corwin also suggests NGC 5942 = HCG 76C and NGC 5944 = HCG 76A. These agree with Bigourdan's assignments (he picked up 3 members) and leaves HCG 76D without a number. See Harold Corwin's identification notes for the full story.

At 228x a number of very faint stars were just resolved around the periphery of the halo in moments of better seeing.  Perhaps two dozen stars were resolved in total including a bright mag 12 star (superimposed field star?).  Many of the resolved stars form a semi-circular loop, ringing the halo along the entire eastern half of the globular.  Several mag 10-11 stars form a long chain curving around from the SW to the east side, ~5' from the cluster.  NGC 5946 is situated within a beautiful Norma star field ~70' E of the brighter globular cluster NGC 5927.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): faint, very small, 1.5' diameter, round, almost even surface brightness with a weak concentration.  A mag 12 star is at the WSW edge (field star).  The core appeared displaced towards this star.  No additional resolution was evident.  Located in a rich star field with globular cluster NGC 5927 70' W.  Viewed at about 14° elevation from Baja.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5946 = h3607 on 8 May 1826 and recorded "not vB; S; glbM; 90"; resolved into stars 16m, with one of 12m, at or a little beyond the sp edge."  His position (mean of two observations) is accurate.


Harold Corwin notes that James Dunlop may have first discovered this globular. Glen Cozens, who examined a copy of Dunlop's original observing log, found about a dozen objects that did not make it into Dunlop's published list and NGC 5946 is probably one of them.


Lewis Swift independently found this globular on 24 May 1898 and reported as new in list XI-180 (later IC 4550) as "pB; pS; lE."  His position is 42 sec of time too far west, but as Harold Corwin notes, there are no other possible nearby candidates.  This was his most southerly observation from California and one of his very last.  So, NGC 5946 = IC 4550.  See Corwin's identification notes for more.

A very interesting object. (See figure 89)"  His position matches UGC 9935, a large, low surface brightness galaxy.  JH's description is unusual for a galaxy.  There are several stars superimposed and in addition I thought the galaxy appeared mottled, so this explains the description.


Lewis Swift probably found this galaxy on 19 Aug 1897 and reported Sw. XII-12 (later IC 4551) as "eeeF, L, R, eee dif".  His RA was about 3.5 minutes too small, a large but not unusual error in his last year of observing.  So, Harold Corwin suggests IC 4551 = NGC 5964.

It appeared larger than the catalogued size of 8".  At 228x (unfiltered), the surface brightness was slightly irregular with possibly a very faint halo or the halo dims at the periphery.  Set in a rich star field with a mag 10 star 2.7' S.  A distinctive trail of mag 12-13 stars meanders off to the east.  Located in the northwest corner of Triangulum Australe, about a degree from the Norma border.


John Herschel discovered NGC 5979 = h3610 on 24 Apr 1835 and recorded "planetary nebula.  Not B; pF; S; R; with something like a protuberance, which may arise from an accidental star, on or close to the edge.  Not quite sharp; a little furred; light not quite uniform; an odd sort of mottling like a resolvable light; taken at first for a vF double star out of focus; 12" diameter; but seen with 240; 320 is too high a power for it.  See figure 7, plate VI."  On 16 Jun 1835, he recorded "planetary; transit just missed; R; 5" diam; about equal in light to a * 9m; of a feeble intensity of light; nearly equable; under 320 it is not nebulous; but indistinct at the edges; a very singular kind of appearance - not "mottled", not "curdled", but yet not planetary.  In a field with about 100 or 150 stars.  His position is accurate, but due to a reduction error the NGC position is 1.0 minute too far west (corrected in the IC 2 Notes section).


Joseph Turner sketched the planetary as annular and brighter or a thicker rim on the north side using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate VII, figure 72).

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): at 273x this bright, fairly well concentrated globular was well resolved into ~60 mag 13-15 star over the entire face of the cluster, including the core.  A loop of stars heads from the north side and bends to the east ending in a nice pair of stars.  A brighter string of stars runs along the north side of the halo.

48" (5/15/12): at 488x appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, small, elongated 2:1 E-W, 20"x10", gradually brightens to the center.  This galaxy is the fainter member of the interacting pair Arp 72, and is situated just 1.5' from the center of NGC 5996.  A spiral arm from the NGC 5996 hooks southwest towards NGC 5994, but the pair is not connected.


17.5" (5/14/88): fainter member of an interacting system with NGC 5996 (Arp 72).  Very faint, extremely small.  Appears as a barely non-stellar knot just 1.5' SW of the center of NGC 5996.  A mag 14 star lies 1.3' SE.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 5994 on 9 Mar 1851.  During an observation of NGC 5996 he noted a  "small nebula preceding."  This observation was not included in LdR's 1861 publication and the discovery was not included in either the GC or GCS.  The rough NGC position is 34 seconds of RA too far west (no position was measured at Birr Castle).

48" (5/15/12): NGC 5996 is the brighter member of an interacting pair (Arp 72) with NGC 5994.  At 488x it appeared quite bright, elongated over 2:1 SSW-NNE, though the brightest central section (bar) is elongated ~E-W.  The galaxy is well concentrated with a very bright, elongated core or bar.  It has an asymmetric appearance with a long, bright arm attached on the east side.  This arm hooks southwest towards NGC 5994 and appears slightly clumpy (a knot in the arm is 24" S of the center).  On the west end of the bar a shorter arm shoots straight north and fades quickly as it starts to hook east, with the brightest portion near the connection with the bar.


17.5" (5/14/88): moderately bright, fairly large, elongated ~N-S, bright core, faint stellar nucleus.  A mag 14 star lies 1.5' S.  Forms a close interacting pair (Arp 72) with NGC 5994 1.5' SW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5996 = H II-97 = h1938 = Sf 25 on 21 Mar 1784 (sweep 183) and recorded "pF, vS, r, preceding 2 pB stars, the most south of which is the brightest.  Other stars besides in the field of view."  CH's reduced position is 17 sec of RA following Arp 72 = VV 16.  JH made two observations and measured an accurate position.  Truman Safford later independently found this galaxy on 1 Jun 1866 and included it in his 1887 discovery list at the Dearborn Observatory.

17.5" (6/30/00): this asterism appears as a faint, elongated group of 9 stars.  Most of these stars are arranged in an arc concave to the NE.  Appears fully resolved and too poor to be a true cluster.


William Herschel discovered NGC 5998 = H VII-29 on 30 Apr 1786 (sweep 559) and recorded "A small cl of vS stars, pretty rich; coming just from the light, I saw it imperfectly, about 5 or 6' long and near 4' broad, in the form of a parallelogram.  Five minutes after it was past, I returned to it, and saw it very well."


At his position is group of stars that Dave Riddle called a "detached scatter of nine 13th to 14th magnitude stars in a loose arrangement spanning about 3' across.  The immediate field appeared bland, making this cluster (asterism?) obvious."  ESO and RNGC both report the object as not found.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 229x, this is a fairly rich, moderately large cluster.  In the center is a striking elliptical ring of roughly two dozen stars.  Surrounding this annulus is a larger loop of stars forming a heart-shaped asterism.  The looping star patterns make this an interesting visual target!  The diameter is roughly 8', though there is no distinct border.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 5999 = D 343 = h3612 on 8 May 1826 and described "a pretty large faint nebula, with several minute stars in it; round figure, 4' or 5' diameter, resolvable."  His position was off by ~10' west-southwest.  JH made a single observation on 9 Jul 1834 and reported "cluster VI class. A pretty rich large cluster, round; little compressed in the middle, 12', stars 12..14th mag, nearly fills field; middle taken."
