= **, Carlson.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3000 on 25 Jan 1851.  On a sketch of the NGC 2998 group he labeled it Beta.  The offset given in the 1 Apr 1878 observation (203.1" in PA 23.6° from NGC 2998) points precisely to a 9" pair of very faint stars (mag 16-16.5).


Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel Nebel", described a "D neb not cont, dist 0.1' 35°; sp one eF, eS, R, bM; nf one perhaps *16."  This refers to the double star above.  Dorothy Carlson calls this a double star in her 1940 paper on NGC corrections.

NGC 3002

09 48 57.4 +44 03 26; UMa

V = 16.5


48" (5/14/12): near the position of NGC 3002 is a faint trio of stars, mag 16.5/16.5/16.9 as well as MCG +07-20-052, an extremely faint interacting pair of galaxies.  One of the two brighter stars is likely the object sketched by Bindon Stoney at Birr Castle in 1851.  At 488x, the two brighter stars were very comparable in magnitude.  The star identified by Corwin (southwest vertex of the triangle) was possibly marginally brighter, though the other mag 16.5 star at the east vertex of the triangle (09 49 01.4 +44 03 37) is a better match with Stoney's sketch.  MCG +07-20-052, the galaxy misidentified in most catalogues as NGC 3002, is just visible as a very low surface brightness patch ~1.5' SE of the trio of stars.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3002 on 25 Jan 1851. On a sketch of the NGC 2998 group he labeled it Epsilon.  The MCG, along with the RNGC, PGC, HyperLeda and other sources, misidentify PGC 28208 as NGC 3002.  Although this galaxy (double) is close to the position on the sketch, the surface brightness is probably too low to have been picked up by Stoney.  In fact, Dreyer reported not seeing Epsilon in his 1 Apr 1878 observation.


More likely, Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 3002 applies to one of two nearby mag 16.5 stars (the third is mag 17.0) with the more likely star at 09 48 57.3 +44 03 26 (2000).

24" (4/20/14): bright, large, very elongated 4:1 WSW-ENE, 4.0'x1.0', mottled appearance, slightly bulging brighter core and nucleus, brighter and patchy along the major axis with a couple of very small knots.  Nearly detached at the west end is a very low surface brightness patch that seems angled or extends beyond the major axis.  A mag 15.7 star is ~1' N of center.  NGC 3003 and NGC 3021, located 30' ENE, are the two brightest members in the USGC U268 group (z ~.005).


13.1" (3/3/84): moderately bright, very elongated 7:2 WSW-ENE, 3.5'x1.0', almost even surface brightness.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3003 = H V-26 = h639 on 7 Dec 1785 (sweep 487) and recorded "cB, mE nearly in the parallel, 8' long, 3' broad."  His position is accurate. John Herschel described this object on 22 Jan 1828 (sweep 51) as "a singular curved wisp of nebula, It curls up and tapers off at the s p side, and is clubbed at the n f extremity."


A total of 13 observations were made at Birr Castle.  On 8 Mar 1858, R.J. Mitchell commented "of unequal brightness throughout its length, p part is F but contains a B patch with a star in it; the foll part is comparatively much brighter and is mottled."

NGC 3004

= *, Corwin.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3004 on 25 Jan 1851. It was placed on the diagram of the NGC 2998 field about midway between NGC 2998 and NGC 3005 and mentioned as "suspected".  Dreyer missed it on his 1 April 1878 observation, though he later added "the place for 1926 [NGC 3004] is evidently wrong, it must be about 9 40 15 +45 14 [based on the sketch]."


The closest object to the position on the sketch is an extremely faint star with SDSS mag(V) = 16.7.  Reinmuth calls it nonstellar (based on a Heidelberg plate):"vF, vS, R, bM, N3000 np 2.4', N3005 nf 2.7'."  Dorothy Carlson identifies it as a double star (based on Mount Wilson photograph) and this is repeated in RNGC, though it is clearly a single star on the SDSS.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3005 on 25 Jan 1851.  He labeled it "Gamma" on a sketch of the NGC 2998 group.  Dreyer gave a more complete description on 1 Apr 1878, "vF, pS, E nnp ssf."  His offset from NGC 2998 (388.5" in PA 62.5°) points exactly to MCG +07-20-054 = PGC 28232, although the RA in the NGC is 10 sec too large (error carried over from NGC 2998).

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3006 on 25 Jan 1851. On a sketch of the NGC 2998 group he labeled it Delta. Dreyer logged it on 1 Apr 1878, "vF, S, stellar."  His offset from NGC 2998 (417.9" in PA 117.2°) points exactly to CGCG 210-037 = PGC 28235, although the RA in the NGC is 12 sec too large (error carried over from NGC 2998).

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3008 on 25 Jan 1851. On a sketch of the NGC 2998 group he labeled it Eta.  Dreyer logged it on 1 Apr 1878 as "pF, S, E, *13-14 1' p[receding]."

Alternative identification: NGC 3009 = NGC 3010sw = MCG +07-20-065

17.5" (2/8/91): this is the southwest member of the NGC 3010 triple system and noted as very faint, small, round.  UGC 5273b = MCG +07-20-066 is just 40" NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3009 = h640, along with NGC 3010, on 17 Mar 1828 (sweep 138). He described it as "Not vF; R; bM; r.  The first of 2 [with NGC 3010]."  His position was 17 sec of RA west and 1.5' north of UGC 5264 = PGC 28303, a fairly large error of 3.4'.  Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position for this galaxy in 1896.  But the identification is very uncertain and it's possible that NGC 3009 applies to the southwest component of the NGC 3010 triplet (NGC 3010B).  See Corwin's notes on NGC 3010 for the quite involved story.

24" (3/21/20): at 375x; triple system oriented SW to NE, with the NE member (NGC 3010C) the faintest.  It appeared extremely faint, slightly elongated, very low surface brightness, 15"x10".  The SW member was fairly faint, fairly small, ~24"x18" SW-NE, very small brighter nucleus and the middle galaxy was fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~20"x14", very small brighter nucleus.


17.5" (2/8/91): triple system consisting of two very faint, small, round "knots" (identified as UGC 5273a and 5273b in the UGC) with a separation of 40" oriented SW-NE.  The third component (UGC 5273c) is 1' NE and appeared as a mag 15.5 "star".  NGC 3009 lies 5' WSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3010 = h641, along with NGC 3009, on 17 Mar 1828 (sweep 138).  He reported it as "F; psbM; r; stars seen.  The second of 2 [with NGC 3009]."  There is nothing at his position, but 35 sec of RA east and 1.4' south is UGC 5273.  His RA for NGC 3009 is also off (to the west), but by only 16 sec, which is strange.  Another possibility is that h640 refers to the southwest component of NGC 3010 (MCG +07-20-065 = PGC 28330).  If that's the case, the relative offsets would be more in line but still not accurate.  Corwin notes that JH's descriptions are generic enough they don’t assist in choosing between these two alternatives.  So, he favors leaving the "traditional" identification as is.


The observations at Birr Castle are interesting.  The 1861 publication only includes the note "Several knots near [NGC 3009 and 3010].  The full account is given in the 1880 monograph.  On 1 Mar 1854 R.J. Mitchell recorded, "one pB [NGC 3009], 6' f and a little n are two others vF, about 3' apart pf; several others round about".  His separations are poor but probably the second part refers to NGC 3010 and one of its companions.  Thirty-five years later in 1878, Dreyer made another observation and wrote, "the f one [NGC 3010] is smaller and in a rectangular triangle of 3 stars."  At least one of these "stars" is likely a galaxy.  Hermann Kobold measured accurate positions of the two southern components of NGC 3010 with the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg.

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 3013 on 18 Mar 1874.  While viewing the field of NGC 3021 he found a nebula at 164.8" in PA 137.2° from a mag 8 star.  His offsets point directly to CGCG 182-024 = PGC 28300.  Due to a misprint in the NGC the declination was reported 40' too far north, although the earlier GC Supplement gave the correct position. As a result when Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again on 12 May 1896 he catalogued it as new in his 3rd discovery list (#1127).  In addition, the galaxy was found by Keeler on a Crossley plate taken between 1898-1900 and included in a catalogue of new nebulae (#188) in the 1908 Publications of Lick Observatory, Vol. VIII.  Dreyer realized the NGC error and corrected the misprint in the IC 2 notes.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 3019 on 21 Mar 1854 with Lord Rosse's 72", along with NGC 3016.  There is no published sketch but the description reads "4 neb.  Two p and f [NGC 3016 and 3019] about 4' apart; the 3rd is north about 3' [NGC 3024] forming the vertex of an obtuse triangle, the 4th is about 4' further north and lenticular [NGC 3020]."  The described orientations are poor and no positions were given, but they certainly refer to the four brightest galaxies.  Only a rough position is given in the GC and the NGC position is 3' south of CGCG 063-081 = PGC 28295.

13.1" (4/29/84): fairly faint, moderately large, diffuse, elongated ~E-W.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3020 = H III-51 = h646 = h642 on 19 Mar 1784 (sweep 177) and recorded "Two [along with NGC 3024], both resolvable and eF. The preceding is the largest and they are about 6 or 7' distant from each other.  Position about 20° np-sf 6 or 7' distant. I saw them better with 240 than 157.  They require some attention before they are well seen." His single position is ~1.0 min of RA too far east.


John Herschel made three observations under h646 and measured an accurate position, but on a 4th sweep he made an error recording the RA 1.0 min too far west and claimed a "nova" under h642.  Dreyer correctly equated the H and h designations in the NGC.

48" (4/7/13): at 375x appeared very bright, large, irregular, asymmetric with a bright, slightly elongated central region, ~40"x30".  Extending to the west of the core is large, faint halo or loop, most evident on the north side of the loop, which is brighter and more sharply defined as it sweeps to the west towards companion NGC 3018.  The loop extends the diameter to ~1.7'.  Mrk 1236, is a very small, but very high surface brightness companion attached on the east side of the core.  LEDA 1170217 = MAC 0950+0035 was picked up in the field, 4.4' ESE.  It appeared faint (V = 16.6), small, slightly elongated, 15"x10", low even surface brightness.


48" (4/2/11): at 375x this bright, interacting galaxy has a very unusual, asymmetric appearance.  The central region is bright, oval 4:3 NNW-SSE, 40"x30", increases evenly to a very small, very bright nucleus.  A larger, outer halo extends mainly to the west.  The halo extends from the central region ~1' in a loop and is brightest along the rim, particularly looping from the north side of the core counterclockwise to the west [the DSS reveals this feature is a spiral arm].  This arm gives the visual impression of a partial ring extending the west of the core.


A bright companion, Mrk 1236, is attached within the small halo on the east side of the core, just 25" ESE of center.  This Wolf-Rayet galaxy appeared moderately bright, very small, elongated 2:1 E-W, ~16"x8", very high surface brightness.  On the SDSS image this object is resolved into several clumps or knots.  NGC 3018 lies 2.8' W of center.  Located 3.4' ESE of mag 9.7 HD 85095.


17.5" (2/8/91): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated 4:3, broad concentration in halo but no nucleus.  A faint star or knot is visible on the east end.  Forms a pair with NGC 3018 3' W and also 3.4' ESE of a mag 10 star.  This is a double system which was probably resolved in the observation as a faint star or knot on the east end (Mrk 1236)!

48" (4/15/10): dazzling view of M81 at 267x (21mm Ethos) and 330x (17mm Nagler).  The  galaxy is elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE and extends at least 20'x10'.  The brightness level increases gradually to the center from the large, very bright oval core but is punctuated at the center by an extremely bright, quasi-stellar nucleus.  A bright spiral arm attaches to the galaxy on the northwest end and bends abruptly to the south, passing across a mag 12 star located 5' NW of center.  As it heads southeast, the arm separates from the main glow of the galaxy and can be traced as it passes just north of double star STF 1387 = 10.8/10.8 at 9", ending to the northeast of the striking double star STF 1386 = 9.3/9.3 at 2.1".  The total length of this arm is ~15'.  The second main arm is more prominent, attaching to the main body on the south end.  This arm is much brighter in a narrow arc as it curves around at its south end.  The southern arm is still relatively narrow with a very well defined edge as it sweeps NNW and gradually separates from the main body.


Holmberg IX was visible 10.5' E of the center of M81. With this dwarf galaxy centered in the eyepiece, the outer halo of M81 was visible near the edge of the field.  At 330x it appeared very faint, fairly large, 2' diameter, round, low even surface brightness with no noticeable concentration.  The galaxy is nestled within a kite asterism including a mag 13 star 1.3' S.

Two mag 11.5 and 11.9 stars are superimposed in the halo at the south edge of the core.  An easily visible spiral arm is attached near these two stars at the south end of the core.  This arm curves due north along the east side and is well separated from the main body.  A second arm was suspected on 10/12/85 as a short extension curving around the NNW end towards a mag 12 star at the WNW edge of the halo and was described as "shorter and much less prominent, though definitely seen" on 1/31/87.  Mag 8.7 SAO 15020 (∑1386 = 9.3/9.3 at 2") lies 10' SSW and the striking double star ∑1387 = 10.7/10.7 at 9" is 8' SSW.  Forms a very striking pair at low power with M82 37' N.  The bright supernova 1993j was located 3' SSW of the core and formed a right triangle with the two mag 11.5/11.9 stars south of the core.

Many of the stars are arranged in a loop or oval on the SW side of the star, so the combination with the bright star appears similar to a diamond ring.

Several very small, bright knots or condensations (Super Star Clusters - SSCs) are just west of a dark wedge that pierces the galaxy on the south side and tapers as it cuts across the center at an oblique angle.  The very bright section of the galaxy to the northeast of the dark absorption wedge also displays mottled structure.  Another prominent dark inclusion cuts into the galaxy from the north on the northeast side of the galaxy.  A very faint extension of low surface brightness haze (the superwind outflow) bulges out from the main portion of the galaxy on the south side.  This glow is west of the dark wedge and east of a mag 10.5 star located 5.8' SW of center. On images this large bulge appears to explode out from the galaxy with filamentary structure.  Overall, there was too much visible structure to describe from a couple of minutes at the eyepiece.

Johann Bode discovered M82 = NGC 3034 = H IV-79, along with M81, on 31 Dec 1774.  Pierre Méchain independently discovered M82 in Aug 1779.


M82 is not in William Herschel's published catalogues, though on 8 Nov 1801 (sweep 1100) he noted "eB, mE sp-nf, about 10' long" and on 30 Sep 1802 (sweep 1112) he logged "a vB, beautiful ray of light, brightest in the middle of all the length, about 8' long and 2 or 3' broad."  John Herschel added it as one of the 8 "HON" objects ("Herschel omitted nebulae") in the Appendix to his Cape Observations (and in the GC as IV-79), as WH assumed it was a new discovery on his last sweep on 30 Sep 1802!


The first published comment about dark lanes was made by Ralph Copeland at Birr Castle on 21 May 1871.  He noted "A most extraordinary object, at least 10' in length, and crossed by several dark bands."

This probably refers to a pair of mag 14.9 stars at 11" separation that was also found by d'Arrest (GCS 5512) when he observed the pair of galaxies and d'Arrest's position was used in the NGC.


WH didn't include this object in his third catalogue as he had already reached his 500 object threshold, but JH added it in an appendix to the Cape Catalogue (HON = [William] Herschel omitted nebulae") and in the GC as II-909 = GC 1972.  There was confusion, though, which objects were the two nebulae previously discovered, and JH noted it was the third of three, instead of the the first of three.  This confusion carried into the NGC and even Dreyer's 1912 notes on WH's third catalogue.  See Corwin's notes for the full history.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3064 = LM 1-161 on 6 May 1886 and noted "mag 16.0, vS, E45°."  A second listing I-162 (probably from a different date).  The second entry mentions "same as 161?", so Dreyer combined them into NGC 3058.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is essentially correct - just 0.2 tmin east of MCG -01-26-001.

The outer halo seems brighter or more extensive on the north-following side and gradually fades, so the periphery has a very low surface brightness.

48" (4/18/15): I made another short observation of this remarkable asymmetric edge-on at 375x and 488x before observing the Twin Quasars, which lie 14' NNW.  The brightest portions of this 6:1 edge-on NNW-SSE is warped and bowed out towards the east in the very bright central section. An intense nucleus is within this central section, though offset to the east of center.  The west side of the central section is irregular in surface brightness due to dust.  The northern extention thins and has a slight bend on the north end, beyond a mag 14 star.  On the south side is a bright streak, but to the east of this streak and further south the galaxy is dusty and sections of the galaxy appear to be highly obscured.  Two mag 14 stars are off the west side of the galaxy and mag 9.6 HD 237858 is 3.5' SE of center.


Both components of the Twin Quasars at mag 16.7 and 16.9 were easily visible nearly continuously at 697x.  The southern component was clearly slightly brighter, although the delta mag is only 0.2.  At 6" separation, the pair was relatively widely split.


48" (4/6/13): I only took a quick look at this gorgeous showpiece edge-on at 375x.  The entire length of the galaxy appeared very mottled, clumpy and dusty, although there was no distinct dust lane.  The shape is irregular and sharply rises to an intense, very elongated 4:1 core that bulges and appears offset from the geometric center.  A mag 14 star is superimposed on the north side and SDSS J100200.73+554247.0, an extremely faint galaxy (V = 18.6), was glimpsed 1.2' E.


18" (3/13/10): fascinating view at 280x.  NGC 3079 appeared very bright, edge-on 5:1 NNW-SSE, 7'x1.4'.  The galaxy extends a little bit beyond a mag 13 star near the north tip of the galaxy and on the south end the galaxy extends beyond a line drawn between mag 9.6 HD 237858 off the SE end and a mag 13.5 star to the west of the southern extension.  Contains a bright elongated 4:1 core, which appears clumpy and mottled with a noticeable irregular surface brightness.  The NNW extension is tilted further towards the west than the core, so appears misaligned.  In addition, the south extension appears warped or has a missing portion on the eastern side probably due to dust, so the entire galaxy has a bent, very striking asymmetric appearance.


17.5" (3/12/88): very bright, large, edge-on 6:1 NNW-SSE, bright core.  Forms a trio with NGC 3073 10' WSW and MCG +09-17-009 6' NW (noted as "very faint, very small, round.")  To the south is a triangle of bright stars; mag 9.0 SAO 27486 7' SE, mag 8.3 SAO 27476 6' SSW and mag 9.1 SAO 27482 3.3' SE of center.

IC 585 is very similar in size and magnitude to NGC 3080 and surprisingly, possibly easier visually due a brighter core.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3080 = H III-934 on 1 Apr 1794 while observing Uranus, the "Georgian Planet".

48" (4/18/15): this beautiful resonant ring galaxy was viewed at 488x and 610x.  It was very sharply concentrated with a very bright, roundish core (slightly oval at 610x) core that gradually increased to a stellar nucleus.  The surface brightness dropped significantly in the inner halo, but then brightened at the edge to a well defined oval ring, extending 5:3 WSW-ENE, 1.3'x0.8'.  The ring was fairly narrow and brightened slightly at the ends of the major axis (southwest and northeast ends).  This was a very distinctive object!  The core itself contains a barred spiral ring, but this feature was not seen.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3084 = h3211 on 26 Mar 1835 and recorded "vF, S, R, attached to a star 13m sf." His position and description matches ESO 499-029.  MCG doesn't label this galaxy as NGC 3084.


Lewis Swift's possibly found this galaxy on 28 Dec 1897 and recorded Sw. XI-102 as "eeeF; eeS; R; double star south; 3078 in field; ee diff."  His position is 30 sec of RA west and 3.5' south of NGC 3084 and his description doesn't help (a single star is attached to the galaxy and a 5" faint unequal pair is 2.5' SE), so the identification of IC 2528 with NGC 3084 is uncertain, though it is suggested by Harold Corwin.

28" (4/12/18): at 285x; NGC 3088A, the main component of this overlapping pair, appeared moderately bright, small, roundish, fairly bright stellar nucleus, 25" diameter.  NGC 3088B is attached to the southeast side.  Most noticeable is a small, elongated nucleus, ~12"x6", that is centered 30" to the southeast of NGC 3088A.  Occasionally very faint extensions were seen, increasing the size to 0.4'x0.1', merging with the halo of 3088A.  A collinear string of four mag 11.5-13 stars is southwest and a mag 9.9 star lies 8' WNW.


UGC 3088 located 6.8' SW, appeared fairly faint, slightly elongated, 20" diameter, weak concentration.  Occasionally fainter "wings" extending E-W were visible, increasing the dimensions to 35"x20".  A wide pair of mag 12-13 stars is 2' W.  The redshift z = .023 is similar to the components of NGC 3088.


17.5" (4/9/94): fairly faint, very small, high surface brightness, possibly elongated ~E-W, either a stellar nucleus or a very faint star superimposed.  A string of four collinear stars mag 11.5-13.3 is SW; the closest is a mag 12 star 4.8' WSW and the farther two forms a nice wide double (12.4/13.3 at 35").  There is an impression of faint haze off the SE end of galaxy which creates a sense of elongation.  On the POSS, this is a double system – the "faint haze" off the SE end is actually an edge-on contact system MCG +04-24-010 = NGC 3088B.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3088 = H III-24 = h661 on 12 Mar 1784 (sweep 166) and recorded "I suspect a vS nebula.  [Higher power] rather confirmed it, but still left a doubt." His position is 8 sec of RA east of this double system.  On 16 Feb 1860 from Birr Castle, Samuel Hunter wrote, "I think there are two wings, spp and sff."  These probably refer to the two components.


The components  have dimensions a) 0.9'x0.8' and b) 0.7'x0.2' and are listed separately as MCG +04-24-010 = NGC 3088a and MCG +04-24-011 = NGC 3088b.

HIs position is an exact match with this small cluster. Trumpler (Lick Obs Bul, Vol 14, No. 420) gives the diameter as 2.5' and the class as 2 2 p.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3107 = H II-898 on 22 Mar 1794 (not in CH's fair copy of the sweep records) while observing Uranus, which was used as a reference star.  His description in his 3rd catalogue reads "By coarse estimation. F. 3' north of a pL red star.  This nebula was seen at 8h 49m, sidereal time, the telescope being out of the meridian [observing Uranus]."


Three observations were made at Birr Castle.  The RA is very close in the GC to UGC 5425 (6 tsec too far west), although the dec is ~7' too far south. In the 17 Mar 1876 observation at Birr Castle, the position is discussed and it states the RA is 54 sec too large in the GC (due to a misidentification of a red star close south of the galaxy).  So, Dreyer's position in the NGC is 48 tsec too far east!


UGC, CGCG and MCG do not label their entries as NGC 3107.  See Corwin's notes for a complete discussion.

48" (5/4/16): fairly bright, very large, very elongated 6:1 E-W, ~15'x2.5'.  Contains a large brighter irregular core region but no nucleus.  A mag 12.5 star is superimposed near the center and a number of fainter stars are superimposed.  Overall the surface brightness is fairly low but patchy with several very small knots.


Near the southwest edge of the galaxy, 3.9' WSW of the mag 12.5 star, is a faint 12" knot, identified in SIMBAD as [BCP93] F3 H2 from the 1993 paper "The dwarf galaxy NGC 3109. I - The data".  A faint 10" knot, listed as [BCP93] F1 H3, is 1.1' NW of the same star and another quasi-stellar knot (perhaps a faint star) is close northwest of the star.  Finally, on the southeast flank of the galaxy is a faint larger patch, perhaps 15"-20", catalogued as [BCP93] F5 H1.


17.5" (2/28/87): fairly faint, very large, very elongated 4:1 E-W, diffuse.  Appears as a low surface brightness streak with very weak concentration.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3109 = h3221 on 26 Mar 1835 and recorded "vF; vL; 12' l; 2' br; lbM; pos of axis 82.3°.  See pl. V. fig 9."  His position and description and sketch (Plate V, figure 9) matches this large edge-on.


Joseph Turner sketch NGC 3109 in Feb 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope, though his sketch shows the galaxy extending between the four stars off the north edge (which are not involved).  A lithograph based on the sketch was never published.  While searching for NGC 3109 on 9 Apr 1885 with the GMT, Pietro Baracchi discovered nearby ESO 499-023.


Although Sidney van den Bergh concluded in his 2000 book "The Galaxies of the Local Group" that NGC 3109 was just outside the Local Group, bur recent papers assume this galaxy (along with Sextans A, Sextans B and the Antlia dwarf) is at a distance of 4.2-4.4 million light, on the outskirts of the Local Group.

This galaxy was discovered by WH (II-305 = GC 2011 = NGC 3122) on 5 Mar 1785.  The GC and NGC positions are incorrect, though, as Herschel's position was reduced using the wrong offset star.  When corrected, II-305 is an exact match with NGC 3110.  Based on historical precedence, NGC 3122 should be the primary designation, though modern catalogues use NGC 3110 as Stephan's position was accurate.


This galaxy was found again by Ormond Stone (I-182) on 31 Dec 1885 and recorded in list I-182.  But Stone made a 1 hour error in RA (confirmed by Corwin on Stone's discovery sketch).  Dreyer assumed this was a new object and catalogued it again as NGC 3518.  Once Stone's error is corrected, NGC 3122 = NGC 3110 = NGC 3518.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this very bright naked-eye cluster measures some 35'-40' in diameter and is framed beautifully in a 50' field with the 27mm Panoptic.  The cluster contains a couple of long curving chains of brighter stars, one forming a huge "U" shaped arc.  There are several pretty smaller groupings and star chains including a striking equilateral triangle of nearly equal mag stars just north of center, consisting of mag 9.2/9.4/10 stars at 20"/22"/27".  Two mag 6-7 stars (brightest mag 6.2 HD 87436) are involved and in addition there are numerous 8-9th magnitude stars scattered across the face of the cluster.  Appears similar to a bright star cloud in Sagittarius or Cygnus and the cluster is just inferior to NGC 3532.  Located 5° west of Eta Carina on the opposite side of Eta from NGC 3532.  This is a young cluster (160 million years old) projected onto the Carina complex and the cluster is heavily contaminated by field stars at varying distances.


Naked-eye and 10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): very bright naked-eye cluster only 5° W of Eta Carinae.  At least 3 dozen stars were resolved at only 10x in the 30mm binoculars!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 3114 = D 297 = h3224 on 8 May 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 reflector from Parramatta near Sydney. He described "a beautiful cluster of stars, arranged in curvilinear lines intersecting each other, about 40' diameter, extended S.p., and N.f."  This is the brightest object Dunlop discovered and his position is within the cluster, though ~10' NW of center.  It's surprising that Lacaille didn't catalogue this bright cluster during his trip to the Cape of Good Hope.


On 4 Feb 1835 (sweep 543), John Herschel noted "an enormous congeries or clustering region of stars 2 or 3 fields in diameter, constituting a decided cluster. Stars 9..14th mag, the larger magnitudes predominating. There must be many hundreds."

RNGC identifies CGCG 093-045 as NGC 3119 but MCG identifies UGC 5450 as NGC 3119.  Corwin feels NGC 3119 is more likely a duplicate of NGC 3121 because of the better positional match.

Sidney Coolidge discovered NGC 3123 = HN 15 on 31 Mar 1859 and simply noted as a "nebulous object" by Bond (director of the Harvard Observatory) in AN #1453.  There are no nonstellar objects in the vicinity of the listed position, given roughly as 9 59 48 +/- 4s, +0 45' +/- 2' for 1859.  That's not unusual as all 8 of Coolidge's other nebulous objects are single or multiple stars. Bigourdan, Reinmuth or Carlson were unable to find his object and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  Harold Corwin lists a few possible candidates (stars) near Coolidge's position.


But in March 2015 I took a look at the Zone Catalogue (volume 6 from HCO, page 4-5) and found the number derived from star #47 (preceding #57 = NGC 3229), in which Coolidge noted "has a perceptible disc?" Furthermore, #47 was measured in Zone 117 but not Zone 118, so the position was not confirmed.  The only problem is the dec for entry #47 fits the range given by Bond but not the RA, though perhaps he made a copying mistake.  Assuming Coolidge's single position is Zone 117 is accurate, then NGC 3123 refers to a single star at 10 18 11.9 +00 02 25 (J2000).

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3126 on 30 Apr 1864 and recorded "F, S, not lE, mag 15 nucleus.  Confirmation still needed." This was his only observation, but his position matches UGC 5466.  Otto Struve independently found the galaxy on 8 Apr 1869 at St Petersburg while searching for Comet Winnecke (7P/Pons-Winnecke).  He recorded finding a "Bright elongated nebula with a stellar nucleus, a miniature image of the Andromeda Galaxy. 4.5' north is a mag 10-11 star with the nebula in PA of 168° [SSE]."  He immediately added a note that this nebula was discovered by d'Arrest in 1864.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3129 = H III-35 = h669 on 21 Mar 1784 (sweep 181) and recorded "vS, E, r.  240 showed it better than 157."  There is nothing near his position besides stars.  John Herschel made an observation on 13 Mar 1831 (sweep 332) and noted, "eF; S; R. Forms a triangle with 2 stars." He only gave a very rough position (from his working list).


It was searched for unsuccessfully at Birr Castle on 3 attempts and was not found by Reinmuth on Heidelberg plate in his photographic survey.  No modern catalogue has a listing for NGC 3129.  Harold Corwin identifies NGC 3129 as a double star (13" pair of mag 14 stars) at WH's position.  There are two stars to the east, which form the vertex of a triangle (as in JH's description).

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 40° elevation in Costa Rica along the Gulf of Nicoya , NGC 3132 was quite beautiful at 200x and 260x.  The 10th magnitude "central star" (an unseen 16th mag companion at 1.65" separation is the true ionizing star) is embedded in the center of a very bright, elongated annulus with a darker center and interesting outer ring elongated NW-SE.  The oval ring is relatively narrow with a brighter outer rim.  Surrounding the ring is a faint, thin outer shell.  The ring is slightly offset in orientation to the major axis of the planetary giving a complex multi-ring appearance.


17.5" (3/28/87): very bright, moderately large, oval.  A dark ring surrounds the bright mag 10 central star.  Viewed at only 10°-11° elevation.


13" (2/23/85): darker around the central star at high power.


8" (3/28/81): mag 9 central star surrounded by a fairly bright, moderately large disc, striking.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3132 = h3228 on 2 Mar 1835 and recorded "Planetary nebula, very large, very bright, elliptic; has in it a 9th mag star somewhat excentric. Its light is exactly equable, ie. not increasing towards the middle; yet I cannot help imagining it to be closely dotted. It is just like a star out of focus in certain states of the mirror and atmosphere. Three stars near, a = 9th mag; b = 9th mag; c = 14th mag; A very extraordinary object."  On a later observation he logged, "Planetary nebula with a 10th mag star in centre; very bright; very well defined, and perfectly equable all over in light, there being no condensation up to the centre. The star is sharp, the nebula velvety, or like infinitely fine dust; a star 14th mag at a distance rather more than a radius of neb from edge (by diagram); has its position from centre = 333.8°."  Sketch on Plate VI, figure 9.


Herschel sketched NGC 3132 and other planetary nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, commenting: "[these] represent planetary nebulae, a class of special interest, and of which, considering their general rarity, the southern heavens have afforded a rather unexpectedly large harvest. Those only are here delineated which have either accompanying stars, or which are distinguished by some peculiarity, as ... [NGC 3132] which has a star or a small disc near its centre".  Father Angelo Secchi published a sketch (fig. 16) and description in 1856 using the 9.6" refractor in Rome.  He called it a "beautiful and large ring nebula similar to that of the Hydra [NGC 3242]."  William Lassell also made a sketch on 16 Apr 1862 through his 48-inch on Malta, showing an annual structure.  He noted "the centre is bright and evidently stellar.  There is a minute star touching the south preceding side of the nebula.  Thie sides of the nebula are flattened and better defined than the ends."


In "Southern Gems", Stephen O'Meara states James Dunlop discovered NGC 3132 while making observations for the 1826 Brisbane Star Catalogue (published in 1835). In a footnote to #3085 he noted "Dusky Yellow - a fine Planetary disk."  John Herschel recognized Dunlop's observation in a letter to Thomas Maclear in 1835.


A star (HD 87892) is plotted at the position of NGC 3132 in the first edition of the Uranometria 2000 because the BD catalogue (used as a source for the U2000) listed the bright "central" star as an entry.  In 1977 Kohoutek and Laustsen announced (1978IAUS...76..207K) that the actual illuminating star is a hot, dim 16th magnitude companion to the mag 10 star at only 1.65" separation. The pair probably forms a true binary


The nickname "Eight Burst Nebula" was coined by H. Shapley and J. S. Paraskevopoulos in "Photographs of Thirty Southern Nebula and Clusters" (1940PNAS...26...31S).  Concerning NGC 3132 they say: "A series of photographs of varying exposures would be necessary to bring out the intricate details…. It could well be named the "8-burst" planetary from the number of distinct arcs on the boundary of the main disk or shell".

17.5" (3/29/97): faint, very small, consists of a 15" core with a faint very thin extension to the SW.  The corresponding arm to the NE was not seen, so the appearance is asymmetric.  This galaxy is listed as nonexistent in RNGC and not identified as NGC 3134 in MCG or CGCG.  Identification from HC (Todd discovery).


David Todd discovered NGC 3134 = Todd 21 on 6 Feb 1878 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet.  Based on Todd's sketch Corwin identified CGCG 064-088 as NGC 3134.  This galaxy is about 3 min of RA east of Todd's very rough RA.  Todd measured a "bright" star 28.3s following and there is a mag 12 star at his exact separation clinching the identification.  Because of his poor position, Bigourdan was unable to recover this object.  The RNGC classifies this number as nonexistent.  Neither MCG or CGCG label their entries for this galaxy as NGC 3134.

Herschel's description applies to mag 6.6 SAO 27566 at 10 13 43.8 +50 29 47, which he thought was surrounded by faint haze but was probably scattered light or dew). Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin agree with this conclusion.


RNGC and MCG misidentify MCG +08-19-011 as NGC 3148.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this galaxy is located just 30' NNW of the bright planetary NGC 3195.  At 260x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, ~0.9'x0.8', slightly brighter core, irregular surface brightness.  John Herschel mentioned a 15th magnitude star was involved, and there is a very faint star at the NE edge.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3149 = h3234 on 24 Feb 1835 (along with planetary nebula NGC 3195) and recorded "F; lE; vlbM; 25"; has a * 15m in it."  Although position is an exact match with ESO 019-001, the RNGC classifies this as an "Unverified Southern Object".  Because of this, it is not plotted on the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas or included in the first edition of the companion Deep Sky Field Guide.

48" (3/1/19): at 488x; bright, large, roundish, ~1.8' diameter.  A very strong, well defined spiral arm is attached at the southeast side of the core.  It curled ~90° counterclockwise to the south and west.  The arm dimmed significantly at the apparent end, but looking carefully I could detect very faint haze further SW in the outer fringes of the galaxy.  Further south of this arm, the outer edge of the galaxy was barely visible as the surface brightness was very low.  The spiral arm on the north side of the galaxy was poorly seen, but a relatively large knot [several HII knots on the SDSS] was visible 25" N of center.  A short section of the spiral arm was also visible extending east from this knot.  A mag 15.4 star is east of the core [40" from center] and very faint haze from the ragged outer halo was detected beyond this star, along with a very dim knot (HII region in the outermost spiral arm) 1' E of center.  A mag 13.9 star is 1.1' SE of center, just beyond the halo.  A mag 10.9 star is 3.4' W.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3162 = H II-43 = h682 on 12 Mar 1784 (sweep 166) and recorded "vF, pL, r.  It seemed to consist of two nebula joined together having two places rather brighter than the ousides of the nebula; but with [higher power] the following of them appeared very plainly to be a star.  The star seemed to have no connection with the nebula, for, though within the nebulosity there was no kind of gradation of light from the star to the nebula as there generally is from the brighter to the more faint part of nebula."  His position was 20 seconds of RA too far west.


On 20 Mar 1854, R.J. Mitchell described it as a "spiral left-handed, spirality very faintly seen, night bad." In 1857, he "suspected a knot in the northwest end."  Based on my observation with a 48", this is probably a knot on the north side. NGC 3575 is a duplicate observation made by d'Arrest in 1863.  See that number for more.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3167 on 1 May 1862 and recorded a "Small and faint nebula.  * 11 preceding 9.5 sec, a little farther north. Whether it is just a nebula, or perhaps a confused group of faint stars is still undetermined, for this evening the air is turbulent."  There is nothing at or near his single position matching his description and RNGC classifies NGC 3167 as nonexistent.


Harold Corwin originally listed this object as lost as there were no candidates nearby, but recently (email from 16 Jun 2014) he found that if d'Arrest made a 1 hr transcription error in his RA (too large), then his position matches NGC 2789 and the mag 11 star is just where he placed it to the northwest of the galaxy!  Corwin notes that d'Arrest made a similar 1 hr recording error on a few other discoveries (NGC 3575, 3760 and 5008), so this is not a unique situation.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3169 = H I-4 = h684, along with NGC 3166, on 19 Dec 1783 (early sweep 58).  His summary description from 4 sweeps reads "cB, pL, cometic, mbM."  He published a sketch in his 1811 paper (Fig. 22) as an illlustration of "nebulae that have a cometic appearance."  John Herschel also made 4 observations, logging on 13 Feb 1826 (sweep 18): "B; R; gmbM; 60"; the foll of 2."


Édouard Stephan published accurate positions for NGC 3166 and 3169 from 18 Mar 1884 in his 13th list (#56 and 57), though he misidentified the galaxies as NGC 3165 and NGC 3166. R.J. Mitchell observed ths galaxy on 15 Mar 1855 with LdR's 72" and commented "sharp at sf edge [dust lane?] and fades of np, spreading out in that direction."  The following January he also noted "perhaps vF neby beyond the well defined sf edge?"

John Herschel discovered NGC 3172 = h250 on 4 Oct 1831 and recorded "vF; R; gbM; 25"; has a * 11m 2' S.  This nebula is remarkable for its proximity to the pole.  Owing to this the RA cannot be determined exactly, and the PD is open to correction."  In the synonym column he called it "Polarissima" but later it was called "Polarissima Borealis" to distinguish it from "Polarissima Australis".  Heinrich d'Arrest observed it with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen on 12 Aug 1866.  He noted the mag 12 star is 75" distant to the north.

48" (4/4/11): NGC 3184 is a beautiful face-on spiral with two main long arms and branches, along with several HII knots (two with NGC designations) in the arms.  Contains a relatively small, very bright core, ~1' diameter with a sharp stellar nucleus.  A mag 15-16 star is visible about 40" NE of the center near the edge of the core.  One arm is attached on the east side of the core and winds counterclockwise around the south side of the core towards the west.  The outer halo of the galaxy to the south of this arm has a much lower surface brightness.  NGC 3181 is a bright, 15" knot (HII region/massive star cluster) embedded in this arm, 1.2' SW of the nucleus.  The arm then continues spiraling outward as it heads north and contains NGC 3180, very small knot with a stellar core at 1.8' NW of the nucleus.  This small knot is within a larger, slightly brighter portion of the arm.  A second prominent arm is attached on the west side of the core and rotates counterclockwise around the north side towards the east.  The surface brightness lowers on the east side and the arm splits into two branches.  A mag 11.7 star is superimposed near the outer edge on the north side beyond the arm.  Located 11' ESE of mag 6.6 HD 89053.


17.5" (4/4/92): fairly bright, large, slightly elongated ~N-S, large 4' halo has a fairly low surface brightness, very weak concentration, small brighter elongated core.  There is an impression of spiral structure though it wasn't distinct.  A mag 11.5 star is at the north edge of the halo 1.8' from the center.  Located 40' W of Mu Ursa Majoris (V = 3.1).


William Herschel discovered NGC 3184 = H I-168 = h688 = h689 on 18 Mar 1787 (sweep 716) and recorded "cB, R, near 8' dia, vgbM.  A considerable star in the northern part of it but unconnected. John Herschel assigned two entries for this galaxy, h688 = H I-168 and h689, with the second entry a poor position for this face-on spiral.


Bindon Stoney, observing with LdR's 72" on 25 Jan 1851, logged "Is triple, neby perhaps extends round them all as far as the star north.  h689 not seen."  The following month, he commented "preceding part probably a portion of a ring."  R.J. Mitchell sketched the the spiral structure on 1 Feb 1856 (fig 13, Plate XXVII in the 1861 publication).  The sketch shows two brighter, elongated knots in the western arm and Dreyer catalogued these as NGC 3180 and 3181.

17.5" (3/25/00): very faint, extremely small, round, ~15" diameter (probably viewed core only), faint stellar nucleus.  Located 1.2' SE of a mag 12.5 star.  This galaxy is identified as NGC 3186 in the RNGC and PGC but the identification is uncertain due to a poor position from Albert Marth.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 3186 = m 195 on 25 Mar 1865 and noted "pF, vS, gbM."  There is nothing at his position, but a couple of candidates are nearby.  The RNGC and PGC identify CGCG 036-085 as NGC 3186.  This galaxy is located 20 tsec of RA east and 5' south of Marth's position.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 3186 may be the northeastern component of CGCG 036-074.  This galaxy is 1.5 tmin preceding and 6' south of Marth's position.


In my observation of the field, I picked up IC 602 = UGC 5561 (double system with IC 601) which is located exactly 1.0 tmin east of Marth's position and appears brighter visually than CGCG 036-085.  Because this galaxy is only off in RA (by a single minute) it seems to me a better choice than the RNGC/PGC candidate.  Stephane Javelle independently discovered IC 602 on 10 Apr 1893 and accurately placed it in list 2-673.  UGC 5561 is identified as IC 602 in all modern catalogues.

17.5" (3/23/85): faint, small, edge-on NW-SE.  A mag 14 star is off the SW side 1.1' from center and a similar star is 1.3' SSE.  Unusual as the major axis is exactly collinear with the brighter edge-on NGC 3190 4.9' SE.  Located 6.3' SSW of mag 7.8 SAO 81276 and 8.8' WSW of NGC 3193.


13.1" (3/24/84) very faint, elongated NW-SE.  Located 5' NW NGC 3190.  A mag 8 star 6' NNE detracts.


8" (4/24/82): not seen.


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3187 in January 1850.  This object was found while observing NGC 3190 and 3193, and labeled Gamma on the sketch.  The description mentioned "[NGC 3190] and [NGC 3187] proibably connected.  In [NGC 3187], several minute stars seen by Lord R."  A sketch made by R.J. Mitchell (in the 1861 publication) shows the galaxy tapering at the southeast end and broader at the northwest end.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3188 = H III-910 = h690 on 8 Apr 1793 (sweep 1038) and recorded "vF, pL, r, iF, some of the stars visible."  John Herschel logged, "eF; pL; 30 arcseconds." (9 Feb 1831, sweep 323).


Ralph Copeland, LdR's observing assistant, logged on 5 Apr 1874 "vF, cL, R, gbM, * 15 m near the middle and several small stars near (within 2 or 3' foll), but does seem resolvable."  One of these "stars" may be a very companion (NGC 3188A) just off the southwest side.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 3189 in January 1850,  He recorded "F neby probably extended to the right of [NGC 3190]."  The sketch produced by R.J. Mitchell (fig 14, Plate XXVII in the 1861 William Parsons' publication) shows NGC 3189 is the strip of NGC 3190 on the southwest side of the dust lane.  None of the subsequent observations at Birr Castle mention this feature, although d'Arrest claimed an observation with the 11" refractor at Copenhagen on 23 Mar 1865.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3190 = H II-44 = h692, along with NGC 3193, on 12 Mar 1784 (sweep 166) and recorded, "Two small nebulae; very like each other; both E and both lbM; than towards the ends, but of the resolvable kind."  His single position is closer to NGC 3187, but must refer to the brighter galaxies though NGC 3193 is not noticeably elongated.


R.J. Mitchell sketched the galaxy on 22 Mar 1857 (plate XXVII, fig 14 in LdR's 1861 publication) and clearly showed two strips of the galaxy separated by a dark lane.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3194 = H III-965 on 2 Apr 1801 (sweep 1096) and noted "vF, vS."  This is one of 15 far northern galaxies with large systematic errors. A corrected position matching UGC 5538 was published in 1911 using plates taken at the Greenwich Observatory with the 30-inch reflector.  Dreyer repeated this position in the notes to his 1912 edition of WH's catalogues.  See NGC 2938 for more on this sweep.


John Herschel independently discovered this galaxy on 2 Sep 1828 and recorded h676 as "vF; S; R.  RA extremely precarious." His rough position is 4' northeast of UGC 5538.  Dreyer also assumed this was a new discovery and catalogued it as NGC 3155 (with an accurate position from d'Arrest).  So, NGC 3194 = NGC 3155.  The primary designation should be NGC 3194, but the common name is NGC 3155.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 350x, appeared fairly bright, moderately large, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, ~40"x35".  The planetary was clearly annular at this magnification with the rim brightest along the east and west sides, giving a bipolar appearance.  The southern end of the rim dimmed, making the rim appear U-shaped, open to the south (though also somewhat weaker on the north end).  The central hole was irregularly shaped with careful examination.  Two mag 12 stars to the west at 45" and 1.6' are collinear with the planetary and a brighter mag 11.5 lies 2' SE.  The surrounding field was lacking in bright stars but rich in faint stars.  NGC 3149 lies 30' NNW.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an interesting planetary at 171x with a UHC filter or at 228x.  It appeared moderately bright and large, ~40"x35", slightly elongated ~N-S.  This disc had a noticeably irregular surface brightness with a slightly brighter knot on the following side and a hint of annularity.  Good response to UHC and OIII filters.  Located in southern Chamaeleon between Zeta and Delta Chamaeleontis.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3195 = h3241 on 24 Feb 1835 and recorded "planetary nebula, pB, not quite uniform in its light, having two brighter patches, lE towards a * (a); slightly hazy; diameter = 15 or 18" (in RA 13 seconds of time). Pos of star a = 265.7 , dist = 0.7 diam from edge, 11th mag.; of star c, pos = 210.7 , dist = 1 3/4 diam from edge."  On a later sweep he described "Planetary nebula, R or vlE; a very little hazy at the edges but still pretty well defined with 240 power. Viewed long and with much attention, being a very remarkable object. I am positive of the existence of two brighter portions near the edges."  Sketched Plate VI, figure 2.


Joseph Turner sketched the planetary in July 1874 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished Plate V, figure 54).  His sketch shows it clearly as annular with brighter arcs on the east and west side.  Pietro Baracchi (10 Apr 1885) thought the annular rim was slightly brighter on the E and W sides.

18" (2/23/06): extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter.  Located 0.5' W of a mag 15-15.5 star that confuses the observation.  This galaxy is unusually faint for a William Herschel discovery.  Located 13' NE of striking double star ∑1421 = 8.2/9.3 at 4.5".


William Herschel discovered NGC 3196 = H III-348 = h694 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and remarked "suspected, eF, pS, lE.  I do not much doubt it; but there is too much light to verify it."  Caroline's reduction is 30 sec of time following CGCG 153-035 = PGC 30121.  John Herschel's position from 17 Feb 1827 (sweep 57) is just 30" south of this galaxy, though he noted "so eF that I remained unsatisfied".  Given that comment and the magnitude of this galaxy, it's amazing that WH apparently picked it up during twilight.  Sweep 396/397 on 11 Apr 1785 was WH's most productive -- with 72 discoveries -- and this was the first object found in the sweep.

48" (5/4/16): at 375x; NGC 3198 is a showpiece, large spiral extending 7:2 SW-NE, ~8.0'x2.5'.  Contains a bright, elongated central "bar", punctuated by a very small bright core that rises to a stellar nucleus.  Slightly brighter patches are visible at the ends of the central region, where the spiral arms emerge.  A tight inner arm is attached on the northeast end; it bends back sharply and closely parallels the central region, extending southwest for a length of ~3.5'.  An outer low surface brightness arm sweeps clockwise on the southwest end.  A symmetric outer arm on the northeast end (of slightly higher surface brightness) curls clockwise towards the west.  The outer tip to tip diameter is nearly 8'.  An uncatalogued fairly bright double star [separation ~3.7"] is 3.5' NNE of center, just beyond the halo and a mag 14 star is 2.2' SSE of center.


17.5" (3/12/94): fairly bright, large, very elongated 3:1 SW-NE, 7.0'x2.5', broadly concentrated, brighter core has an indistinct elongated nucleus and an irregular surface brightness.  Two mag 14 stars are close south (nearest is 2.0' from the center) and a mag 11 star is just off the NNE edge 3.5' from the center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3198 = H I-199 = h695 on 15 Jan 1788 (sweep 800) and remarked "cB, mE, gbM, about 5' long and 2' broad from sp to nf."  John Herschel wrote on 20 Mar 1828 (sweep 140), "F; vL; bM; mE; 6' large, 2.5' br; r[esolvable]." George Stoney, observing with LdR's 72" on 3 Mar 1850, noted "probably a faint spiral."  It was included in the list of "Spiral or curvilinear" nebulae in LdR's 1850 PT paper.  In later observations, a "dark vacuity ssp Nucl" was noted as well as "dark spaces throughout its length".

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x and UHC filter this Wolf-Rayet bubble appeared as an amazing 180° crescent, open on the east side and forming a thick "C" shape.  The rim of the bubble is widest on the western portion, although it is slightly brighter on the southwest side.  The main portion of the crescent spans ~13' from the north to south end and appears ~3.5' thick in the middle, though fainter nebulosity spreads out to the southeast.  A double star (h4302 = 10.4/11.6 at 23") is embedded near the south end.  The surface brightness is fairly high overall, though irregular with slightly brighter patches, knots and streaks.  A faint 5' linear streak or filament running NNW-SSE is superimposed along the outer western edge, though it separates or resolves from the Crescent at its north and south ends.  The illuminating mag 10.6 Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18 = HD 89358) is located about 4' E of the center of the "C", and is asymetrically positioned with respect to the center of the entire shell.  This W-R bubble is situated four degrees NW of the Eta Carina nebula in a rich Milky Way star field.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x and UHC filter, this HII region appears as a remarkable, huge crescent, roughly 11'x7' (the main region extends nearly 1/3 of the 39' field).  Opens up towards the east in a huge "C" shape.  The SW portion of the crescent is brightest, although the overall surface brightness is irregular with a mottled or curdled appearance.  A few stars are superimposed even with the filter with the brightest stars at the SW end.  Fainter nebulosity sprouts out of the SW end, increasing the total size by several arcminutes.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an amazing HII region with a 20mm Nagler and UHC filter at 103x.  It appears as a fairly bright, thick crescent opening towards the east, roughly 10'x6'!  The surface brightness was quite irregular with a UHC filter and the nebulosity was noticeably brighter on the south end where a couple of brighter stars are embedded.  Off the bright portion of the south end, much lower surface brightness haze extends the curve further SE for several arcmin and spreads out somewhat increasing the length to  ~15'.  The main mass has a curdled, mottled appearance and dark lanes appear to intrude into the nebulosity.  The illuminating star HD 89358 is a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18) and this nebulosity is reminiscent of the Crescent Nebula in Cygnus (it could be dubbed the "Southern Crescent").


9x50mm finder (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): surprisingly, NGC 3199 was visible in the 50mm finder at just 9x by blinking with the OIII filter.  An elongated bar of nebulosity was seen!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 3199 = D 332 = h3239 on 1 May 1826 and described a "very faint ray of nebula, about 2' broad, and 6' or 7' long, joining two small stars at the south following extremity, which are very slightly involved, but their lustre is not diminished from that of similar small stars in the field. The north extremity also joins a group of small stars, but they are not involved. Figure 15 [very basic sketch]."  Unfortunately Dunlop made a one degree error in reading or copying the declination so he didn't receive credit in the GC or NGC (Glen Cozens recovered the identity of D 332).


John Herschel rediscovered this Wolf-Rayet nebula on 1 Apr 1834, unaware of Dunlop's earlier observation.  He recorded, "A very large and very remarkable nebula, which is brighter to the S.f. part, and dies off to the N.p., having a curved form and forked tail. In the head of it is a double star. The nebula is pretty bright, very large, figure irregular, 8' long, 4' broad. Among a vast number of milky way stars."  On 5 Feb 1835 (sweep 543, the night described in his diary as "most superb" and "having attained the sublime of Astronomy - a sort of ne plus ultra") he wrote, "very bright, very large, 10' long, of a concave or crescent form, sharply terminated inwards, fading away outwards. In a field of about 80 stars. The place is that of a 13th mag star, about the middle of the crescent, or rather nearer the head."  His sketch from that night is reproduced on plate IV, figure 3.  Later that month (sweep 552) he wrote: "pretty bright, very gradually brighter in the middle, of a falcated or semilunar shape, extending over three-quarters of the field. The place is that of a double star in its vertex or southern extremity."


Joseph Turner sketched NGC 3199 carefully on 28 Apr 1876 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished lighograph plate VII, figure 67).  The SE end is tapered and brightest and the wide northwest end is forked with the eastern fork slightly brighter.  A lithograph was completed but not published.  Albert Le Sueur had earlier made a similar sketch with the 48", as well as Pietro Baracchi on 16 Jan 1885.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this beautiful, loose globular was well resolved with approximately two hundred mag 12 to 16 stars visible within a 10' region.  An unusual feature is the large number of brighter cluster stars that appear to be superimposed right on top of a fainter layer of stars in the central core.  The core seemed displaced towards the north side as if part of the northern half of the cluster was obscured and flattened.  This apparent affect may also be due to a larger number of brighter resolved stars that are superimposed on the northern half of the core.  A number of stars in the outer halo are arranged in strings and chains and the outer extent of the halo is irregular.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): beautifully resolved globular at 171x and 228x.  The cluster is fairly large, ~8'-10' diameter with more careful viewing.  Roughly 150 stars were resolved, though the number grew with magnification and averted vision.  A fairly dense layer of brighter mag 11.5-12 stars were resolved right over the bright core.  The halo, which has a large number of mag 13 stars, had a scraggly, irregular edge and seemed elongated - possibly partially obscured by dust.  This concentration class X cluster is 7th in ranking of brightest stars (mag 11.7) and 10th in horizontal-branch mag stars (mag 14.8).


13" (2/23/85): this fairly bright globular cluster appears fairly large and mottled.  But only a few stars were resolved due to the view being compromised by the very low elevation (~5° altitude) from northern California.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 3201 = D 445 = h3238 on 1 May 1826 with his 9-inch reflector at Parramatta, NSW, and described a "pretty large, pretty bright round nebula, 4' or 5' diameter, very gradually condensed towards the centre, easily resolved into stars; the figure is rather irregular, and the stars are considerably scattered on the south preceding side: the stars are also of slightly mixed magnitudes."


John Herschel first observed NGC 3201 on 20 Apr 1836 and recorded a "globular cluster, irregularly round, gbM, not v m comp, 6', resolved into stars 13...15th mag." On a second sweep he called it "irregularly round, 7' diameter, but the outliers extend to at least 10' or 12'; gpmbM, but not very much compressed; all resolved into stars 13..16th mag."


NGC 3201 is 7th in ranking of brightest member stars (mag 11.7) and 10th in ranking of horizontal-branch mag (mag 14.8).  The distance is ~20,000 light years.

On 12 Apr 1830 (sweep 248), John Herschel wrote, "vF; R; vgbM; 30"; the preceding of 3 neb in a triangle.  Some stars near."  His position was approximate and as a result the NGC position is 2' too far south.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3203 = h3240 on 24 Mar 1835 and recorded "pB; E; gbM; 25"."  His RA was 1.0 minute too small.  But he measured an accurate RA on the next sweep (563).  Unfortunately he rejected the second (accurate) RA, so the position in the NGC is in error.  Clearly his observations, though, refer to ESO 500-024.  Jermain Porter measured an accurate micrometric position in 1907, using the 16-inch Clark refractor at the Cincinnati Observatory, though he called this object a "nova".

17.5" (1/28/89): NGC 3210 is a pair of mag 13.5/14.5 stars at 24" separation located just 1' WNW of NGC 3212.  This double was easily resolved.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3210 = H III-979 on 26 Sep 1802 (sweep 1111, his second to last sweep) and recorded  "The preceding [with III-980 = NGC 3212 and III-981 = NGC 3215] stellar; they are all in line and about 1' distance from each other.  The preceding is the most north, about 2' more than the last."  A pair of mag 13.5/14.5 stars at 24" separation is the only object matching his description with respect to the two nearby galaxies.


In the 1912 notes to WH's third catalogue, Dreyer states the RA for NGC 3210 requires a correction of +1.0 tmin in RA (probably based on an observation by Bigourdan) and this would match one or both of the stars. In 1892 William Denning reported "there are two or three faint stars in the place assigned for it [NGC 3210], but, like D'Arrest, I see no nebulosity [in a 10-inch reflector]."  Dorothy Carlson identifies this object as a star in her 1940 paper on NGC corrections.

The next sweep he recorded "perfectly round; very well defined, with a perfectly uniform light, not at all mottled; = a star 10th mag, of which brightness there are 5 or 6 more in the field, and not less than 150 others less bright. Examined by both Mr Maclear and myself with 240x which shows it proportionally magnified; quite round and planetary; a little hazy at the edges, but not more so than is due to the decidedly bad definition of the night, and the imperfect figure of the mirror, which has been injured by careless polishing on too soft a polisher."

The halo has only a weak concentration and with averted vision appears to merge with the halo of NGC 3227.  A low surface brightness spiral arm on the west side of NGC 3227 extends north to the outer halo of NGC 3226.


17.5" (4/25/92): moderately bright and large, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, smoothly increases from halo to a bright core and an almost stellar nucleus.  The halo extends to almost 2' diameter with averted vision and fades into background.  Forms a striking pair with NGC 3227 at the south side with 2.3' separation between centers.  The outer halo is just in contact with NGC 3227 at the SSE edge.  NGC 3222 lies 13' W.


13.1" (4/16/83): fairly faint, broad concentration to a brighter middle.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3226 = H II-28 on 15 Feb 1784 (sweep 146) and recorded "Two nebula almost close together.  Perhaps 1 1/2 or 2' asunder, they are pretty considerable in size and of a roundish form; but not cometic; they are vF."  His position was 17' too far north, but d'Arrest and Schultz measured accurate positions used in the GC and NGC.


Father Secchi found NGC 3226 and 3227 on 6 Mar 1853 with the 9.5" Merz refractor and announced the pair as new in Astronomische Nachrichten 36, p. 243 (1853).  He mentioned the nebulae were "not listed in Herschel's Observations of nebulae and clusters of stars [Slough catalogue]."  Like a number of observers, Secchi missed the prior discovery as he only checked the Slough catalogue or was misled by Herschel's poor positions.  In 1855, d'Arrest reported these nebulae were discovered previously.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3234 = h706 on 24 Dec 1827 (sweep 115) and noted "pB; R: psbM; 30"."  There is nothing at his position, though his brightness estimate of "pB" implies a duplicate observation (with a bad position) of a reasonably bright galaxy.  In the GC, JH mentioned it might be a comet.


This object was not found in six attempts at Birr Castle (1852-56), and Reinmuth and Carlson also reported it as not found, based on photographic searches.  In the NGC Notes section, Dreyer states that NGC 3234 is probably identical to NGC 3235 with a 1 degree error in declination.  In the IC 1 notes, though, Dreyer states that NGC 3234 ≠ NGC 3235, as both were seen by William Frederick Denning.  Nevertheless, Corwin concludes "NGC 3234 is almost certainly = NGC 3235."

V = 11.3;  Size 5.0'x3.3';  Surf Br = 14.2;  PA = 80°


48" (5/4/16): NGC 3239 was examined at 488x, specifically looking for the two tidal tails not seen in the previous observation with Lowrey's 48".  A very faint curving tail or hook (identified as "Tail A" in Krienke & Hodge's 1990 paper "The structure of the irregular galaxy, NGC 3239") was seen extending from the very bright HII knot (VV 95b) on the southeast side.  It curves clockwise to the southeast in the direction of a mag 15.8 star [2' ESE of the mag 10 superimposed star].


Beyond the west end of the main glow is a fairly wide, very low surface brightness glow (the start of "Tail B") in the direction of a mag 12.5 star (2.4' due W of the bright star); it then sweeps broadly towards the south.  A narrow extension heading southwest ends at a faint HII knot, perhaps 6" diameter, which is identified in NED as NGC 3239:[HK83] 75 and 80.


48" (2/19/12): NGC 3239 = Arp 263 is a large, disrupted irregular, dominated by numerous HII regions.  It was a fascinating sight at 488x.  A mag 10 star is superimposed on the southwest side of the galaxy with the patchy, highly irregular surface brightness glow of the galaxy extending mainly north and east of the star.


A very bright, round knot of ~15" diameter is prominent on the southeast side of the galaxy.  This HII complex is catalogued as VV 95b in NED and as region #6 and #10 in Hodge-Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of HII Regions in 125 Galaxies".  A faint star or knot is attached on the north side.  A "star" recorded just off the west side of this knot turns out to be supernova SN 2012A, discovered on 7 Jan 2012, still currently around 14th magnitude (see image at http://skycenter.arizona.edu/gallery/Galaxies/ngc3239).  Very faint haze extends southeast of VV 95b, but the "tail" structure was not seen.


Along the north side of the galaxy (elongated east-west) are several additional knots.  About 30" due north of VV 95B is HK[83] #3 and #4.  This close pair of knots appeared as a faint, small, irregular glow, ~6" diameter.  Patchy haze is just west, but with no condensed spots. Further west, and 40" due north of the mag 10 star, is a moderately bright, small, round knot, ~10" diameter that has several HK[83] entries (#28/29/31/34).  To the west of this knot, the glow of the galaxy ends near HK[83] #57/58, a faint low surface brightness knot that is elongated N-S.


18" (3/28/09): moderately bright and large, irregular shape and mottled appearance, elongated ~2:1 E-W, ~1.0'x0.5'.  A mag 9.5 star is superimposed on the SW side with the brighter portion of the galaxy extending to the east.  On the SW end of the galaxy is a bright HII knot (VV 95B = Hodge-Kennicutt #10) of ~20" diameter.  The galaxy has a patchy surface brightness with an ill-defined, irregular halo.  A number of fainter galaxies are in the field (background cluster) including CGCG 94-42 2.9' SE, CGCG 94-40 4.8' N, CGCG 94-43 6.3' NNE, UGC 5639 8' NE, CGCG 94-39 8.5' N, CGCG 94-46 8.5' SE.


17.5" (4/13/91): fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, very unusual appearance as a mag 9 star (BD+17 2217) is superimposed on the south side.  An unusually bright knot is following the bright star by 51" on the SE side of the galaxy. This is possibly an offset nucleus or more likely an HII knot.  The galaxy appears to extend to the west from this knot.  The galaxy exhibits an irregular surface brightness with edges difficult to define as it fades into the background.  The halo is more extensive to the north with averted vision.  About 2' NW and 2' W are two mag 11 and 12 stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3239 = H IV-10 = h710 = h3246 on 21 Mar 1784 (sweep 181)and recorded "A pretty considerable star, with a milky vF brush after it.  The position of the brush is about 15 or 20° nf.  With 240 I saw 2 vF stars towards the confines of the brush; but they seemed to have no connection with it.  The bright star is the following one of a triangle, the preceding stars of which are a little smaller.  It precedes a large star 3 1/2 min of time and is 2' more north."  His description and position applies to Arp 263 = VV 95.


10 observations were made at Birr Castle, with knots in NGC 3239 mentioned several times.  On 10 Jan 1856, R.J. Mitchell commented "A knot north of the star and another nff, the space between them and the star is filled with faint mottled nebulosity.  A star suspected in np end of the following knot.  A very faint nebula suspected following?".  The last comment probably refers to CGCG 094-042, which is 3' ESE.


On the POSS, the bright knot on the southeast end seems like it could be an interacting galaxy but on the SDSS it looks like a large, blue HII region.  Also the area immediately north seems dusty.  Contains unusual asymmetric arcs to the south as if very disturbed.  This galaxy has a listed redshift of only 0.0025, while the surrounding galaxies (6 viewed on 3/28/09) have a redshift of z = .044.

82" (5/4/19): at 400x; fairly prominent wings or handles were visible on both ends of the major axis of the inner lens.  Both "handles" extended well into the halo and greatly increased the length of the bright lens, which showed a couple of brighter interior knots.  The halo was surrounded by an obvious outer shell.


48" (4/18/15 and 5/1/19): In addition to the structure previously noted, the sharply defined inner ring clearly has lower surface brightness extensions at the northwest and southeast end, creating an inner lens.  The bulge on the northwest end is a bit larger and brighter, though the southeast end of the ring has a slightly brighter knot.


Two galaxies are nearby.  PGC 155202, 3.9' SSW of NGC 3242, is fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, 20"x15", very weak concentration.  A mag 11.2 star lies 1.9' NE.  PGC 155215, 3.4' SE of NGC 3242, is faint, small, slightly elongated WNW-ESE, 15"x12", low surface brightness.  A mag 14 star lies 0.6' WNW and a mag 10 star is 2' E.


48" (2/18/12): at 814x, the multiple ring structure was remarkable.  The small, dark central hole and bright central star was surrounded by a beautiful inner lens, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~25"x15".  This vivid turquoise lens was brighter at the ends of the major axis and bulges out with an extension on the northwest end.  Surrounding the lens was a broader halo or shell with a rounder outline, ~45"x35" NW-SE.  This shell had a distinctive light pink or salmon color.  Highlighting the very edge of this shell is an extremely thin, slightly brighter greenish ring.  A low surface brightness outer halo surrounds the planetary.


48" (4/1/11): stunning view at 488x with a high contrast, high surface brightness double ring structure and an outer third shell.  The small inner lens has an electric turquoise color and is elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~25"x15".  At the southeast end of the major axis of the inner ring is a well-defined, bright knot.  The irregular inner ring is also brighter and thicker along the northwest end, though not as bright or sharply defined as the southeast knot.  The dim central portion is punctuated by the bright central star.  The outer ring is rounder and extends ~45"x35" NW-SE, with the limb unevenly lit.  The greenish color is not as intense in the outer ring.  Between the two main rings the nebulosity has a pinkish hue.  The main structure was surrounded by a low surface brightness outer halo, at least 1.5' diameter, which significantly increased the total size!


18" (4/9/05): at 435x, the double shell structure was prominent and exhibited filametary structure outside the inner ring.


17.5" (3/25/00): this beautiful PN has a very high surface brightness and a bluish color at 100x.  The view at 280x-380x is stunning with a well-defined double shell structure.  The bright, narrow inner ring is surrounded by a second fainter oval envelope.  Inside the bright lens is a dark, 10" donut-hole with a faint central star marking the center.  In moments of steady seeing, the inner ring has a hard-edge and the central star is easier.


17.5" (1/31/87): at 415x appears very bright, fairly small, bluish color, central star is visible.  Prominent double lens structure with a bright inner lens surrounded by a second fainter elliptical shell.  Stunning at high power with a striking "eye" appearance with a darker center.


13.1" (3/24/84): very bright, bright inner lens surrounded by a second fainter elliptical shell.  At 350x there is a darker center to the inner lens and the central star is visible almost continuously.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3242 = H IV-27 = h3248 on 7 Feb 1785 (sweep 368) and described this bright planetary as "a beautiful, very brilliant globe of light; a little hazy on the edges, but the haziness goes off very suddenly, so as not to exceed the 20th part of the diameter, which I suppose to be from 30 to 40" in diameter. It is round, or perhaps a very little elliptical, and all over of an uniform brightness: I suppose the intensity of its light to be equal to that of a star of the 9th magnitude."  On a second observation he logged "Beautiful, brilliant, planetary disk, ill defined, but uniformly bright, the light of the colour of Jupiter. 40" diameter. Second observation, near 1' diameter by estimation."  Interestingly, this is perhaps the only example where WH referred to a color in a planetary.


William Lassell observed NGC 3242 on 12 Mar 1853 with his 24-inch equatorial reflector on Malta and noted "a brilliant light blue colour with slight green tinge." The double ring structure was described at Birr Castle, as well as the northwest extension of the inner ring. On 6 Apr 1863 Samuel Hunter logged,"Outer ring is brightest north and south and fainter preceding, but vF on sf side, it does not appear so blue as the inner and brighter one....The little projection of np end of the bright ring is very marked." E.E. Barnard and Sherburne Burnham observed the planetary with the 36-inch at Lick Observatory on 25 Feb 1889.  Barnard described in his logbook "a glowing star in center of dark space, this in in parallelogram or diamond shape () of beautiful bluish green.  This in an elliptical rose colored disc."


Admiral Smyth noted the planetary "resembles Jupiter" in his "Cycle of Celestial Objects" (1844), following Herschel’s comment.  But the nickname "Ghost of Jupiter" was apparently first used by Captain William Noble.  In the 1882 issue of Knowledge, he wrote "It will be a seen as a pale-blue disc, looking just like the ghost of Jupiter." He repeated this description in "Hours with a Three-Inch Telescope" (London and New York, 1886).  William Tyler Olcott also stated "It will be seen like a pale blue disk, like a ghost of jupiter" in his 1909 book "In Starland with a Three-Inch telescope”.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "the inner, roughly elliptical ring with its slightly fainter extensions is about 26"x16" in pa 145°.  The outer and considerably fainter oval disk is 40"x35", and shows faint ring or shell effects at its edges.

NGC 3247 = ESO 127-18 = Westerlund 2 = OCL-807 + Gum 29 = RCW 49

10 24 13 -57 45 48; Car

Size 6'x4'


14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 230x): NGC 3247 consists of a compact cluster (often referred to as Westerlund 2), one of the most massive young star clusters known in the Milky Way, and a large, irregular H II region (RCW 49) with star-forming pillars similar to the Eagle Nebula.  At 230x, the cluster extended ~1.5', but the richest part was a dense, elongated clump only 45" long with a half-dozen tightly packed mag 13.5-14 stars resolved in an WNW-ESE string.  Off the SW side is mag 13.5 WR 20a, one of the most massive binary systems (both superluminous O3-type stars).  The cluster is situated 12' N of mag 5.8 HD 90289.


At 145x, fairly faint emission haze was easily visible in an irregular 2.5' region just to the east of Westerlund 2. A mag 12 star is embedded near the center of the nebula, a mag 11.5 star is just off the north edge and a few additional stars are involved.  Adding a NPB filter, RCW 49 is a fairly bright, irregular nebula!  The brightest part (centered on the star) was roughly circular with a well-defined northern boundary, but it spread further south and southwest to a ~4'x3' region.


Cr 220 (often misidentified as NGC 3247) is located ~15' SE of the NGC 3247 complex in the same low power field.  Roughly three dozen stars were resolved at 145x in a 6' circle, with the central part slightly condensed.  The brightest mag 9.8 star is at the north end with a mag 12 companion [13" separation].  A small quadrilateral of mag 13-13.5 stars [sides 14", 14", 18", 17"] is on the southwest side.  No involved nebulosity was seen.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3247 = h3250 on 1 Apr 1834 and described "a curious object. Stars involved in evident nebula."  The next sweep he logged, "there is a nebulous appearance, which merits re-examination. Observed much past meridian, and no reliance on the PD [polar distance]."  A third observation only has a very approximate polar distance. His rough (mean) position is 10 24.8 -57 51 (2000).  Joseph Turner unsuccessfully searched for this object using the 48" Melbourne Telescope on 12 Feb 1879, as well as Pietro Baracchi on three different occasions, perhaps due to Herschel's poor position.


Using a Harvard plate, DeLisle Stewart identified NGC 3247 at 10 23 58 -57 48.5 (2000), and Dreyer repeated this position in the IC 2 notes.  Brian Skiff places NGC 3247 more accurately at 10 24 01 -57 45.6, corresponding with ESO 127-SC18 = Westerlund 2.  This compact cluster (~1.5' dia) is embedded in the HII region RCW 49 = Gum 29, which spreads out ~10' in size.  ESO and Lynga misidentify Cr 220 as NGC 3247.  This group of stars is 1.0 tmin following and 5' south of JH's position.

Lewis Swift likely found this galaxy on 30 Dec 1897 and reported Sw. XI-108 as "eeeF; eeS; R; eF * in contact; [south-preceding] of 3267."  Herbert Howe examined Swift's position in 1900 and found "[NGC] 3257, 3258 and 3260 are in the same field, and I measured them all on the same night, but could not see Swift 108, which is supposed to be close by. 3260 has a star of mag 11.5 about 20" south, and Swift 108 is said to have an "eF * in contact."  Since the position and description of Swift 108 agree closely with those of 3260, I judge them to be identical."  As a result Dreyer didn't assign XI-108 an IC designation.  Harold Corwin comments on inconsistencies in Swift's earlier discovery lists.  Swift wrote "p[receding] of 2" in his 6th discovery list from Lowe in MNRAS and "f[ollowing] of 2" in Popular Astronomy. Then he included it again in his 7th discovery in MNRAS as the "sp of 2"!  Assuming he found NGC 3260, it closely follows NGC 3258, though technically "sp of 3267" is correct.

Herman Schultz discovered NGC 3272 = Nova VI on 9 Mar 1866 with the 9.6-inch refractor at Uppsala Observatory.  His micrometric position is a perfect match with a close double star (mag 12.7/13.7 at 4").  In the notes section of his monograph "Micrometrical Observations of 500 Nebulae" Schultz describes "an insignificant object; preceding [NGC 3277] about 68s and 160" s; a * 10m f 0s.2 and 135" n."


A mag 11 star is exactly 135" north of the double star and the offset with NGC 3277 also matches, so there is no doubt of this identification.  On the night this double star was found, Schultz recorded the sky conditions as "Aurora.  Images dull."  This probably contributed to the close double star appearing nebulous, although a number of Schultz' objects are single or double stars.

At 262x there was a confused glow, ~1' diameter.  Within the glow, two small knots (NGC 3280w and NGC 3280e), ~0.4' and 0.3' were resolved, oriented E-W, with the larger component on the west side (separation is 40" between centers).  At moments there was a impression of the very small and faint third component squeezed between these two galaxies.  In a small group with NGC 3296 4.8' S and NGC 3297 7.1' ESE.  Located 4.6' NE of a mag 9.5 star.


Andrew Ainsley Common discovered NGC 3280 in 1880 with his 36-inch silvered glass reflector and described a "F double neb with 2 stellar centres".  Common's position is poor, but the description clearly refers to the triple system MCG -02-27-006, -007 and -008. Common probably observed -006 and -008, the two brightest of the trio.


Six years later (26 Feb 1886), Francis Leavenworth made an independent discovery with the 26" refractor at the Leander-McCormick Observatory, though his rough position for LM 1-173 (later NGC 3295) was off by 2.7 minutes of RA.  Leavenworth remarked, "D neb or sev st inv in neb", echoing Common's description.


Finally, Stephane Javelle found this trio again on 19 Apr 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at Nice, assumed J. 1-179 (later IC 617) was new and measured an accurate position.  He also mentioned "D or st involved", so partially resolved the components.  So, NGC 3280 = NGC 3295 = IC 617.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes and Malcolm Thomson's IC Research Database.

The given position (updated to 2000 coordinates) is 10 32 47 (approximate), -46 15 14.  JH also made a 10' error in declination (too far north) in the GC, which was copied into NGC.


ESO couldn't find a suitable candidate and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  But assuming the RA was rough, I looked at ESO galaxies and found a likely candidate ESO 263-G48 located at 10 31 11.5 -46 15 05 (J2000).  This galaxy is 1.6 tmin preceding JH's rough RA and a nearly perfect match in declination.  It is also fairly bright (V = 11.5), so it's unlikely it would have been missed in his sweep.  Both NED and HyperLeda use this identification.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3284 = H III-912 on 8 Apr 1793 (sweep 1038) and noted "eF, vS, 300 confirmed it and showed it very plainly."  His position is 2' southwest of NGC 3288 and 5' south of brighter NGC 3286, both observed by WH the following night.


Dreyer comments in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that "it precedes III-913 (NGC 3408) 16.0 tmin, 5' N, so it is no doubt identical to either III-917 or III-918 [NGC 3286 or NGC 3288] which were observed the following night (sweep 1039) without any mention of III-912.  Harold Corwin states the GC/NGC position of NGC 3284 is 10 seconds of RA too small and that NGC 3284 is likely a duplicate observation of NGC 3286.  See Corwin's notes.


Karl Reinmuth equated NGC 3284 with a "*14 npp 1.5' of NGC 3288; no neb seen; nothing sp of NGC 3288."  This conclusion was repeated by Dorothy Carlson in her NGC correction paper and it is repeated by the RNGC.  It's more likely WH picked up one of the nearby galaxies.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): stunningly rich and bright open cluster, situated 2° northwest of the Eta Carina nebula.  At 105x, 60-70 stars are packed into 7' with many of the stars seemingly arranged in concentric circles!  Appears compact and well-detached, even in a rich Carina star field.  A striking linear trio of mag 6.5-7.5 stars (total length 1.5') runs SW-NE to the center including an orange star (mag 7.2 supergiant V361 Car) on the SW end, a blue star and a white star at the center (mag 6.5 B0-type supergiant HD 91969).  A mag 6.7 star (HD 91943) is on the NW side, 2.2' from center.  NGC 3293 is one of the top southern clusters and a worthy rival in beauty to the Jewel Box, though historically has received much less acclaim. Visible naked-eye and resolved in the 9x50 finder.  The large HII region/cluster NGC 3324 lies 30' SSE.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this very rich, young cluster is situated just NW of the Eta Carina complex and is one of the top open clusters in the southern sky.  It is bright, compact and very rich with a half-dozen mag 6-8 stars over a rich background of dozens of mag 10-13 star in a 10' diameter.  Appears somewhat similar to the Jewel Box including a mag 7 reddish supergiant, but with even a more compact appearance.  The listed 40' diameter is much larger than the visual impression.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 3293 = Lac II-8 = D 321 = h3276 in early 1752, using a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He described a "Small heap of 4 small stars forming a lozenge."


James Dunlop claimed to observe the cluster 4 times (first on 29 Apr 1826) and described "a very small cluster of very small bright stars; round figure, about 4' diameter; rich in extremely small stars resembling faint nebula".  His position is poor -- 17' WSW of the cluster.


John Herschel only has a rough position in the Cape catalogue using his small refractor (no published observations with his 18-inch!) and he noted "a fine, bright, rich, not very L cluster. (Equatorial zone review)."  A corrected RA was given in the IC 2 notes (Harv. Ann., xxvi, p207).  Neither Lacaille nor Dunlop are listed as discoverers in the Cape catalogue, GC or NGC.


Henry Chamberlain Russell coined the nickname the "Gem Cluster" in an 1879 paper.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3301 = H II-46 = h728 on 12 Mar 1784 (sweep 166) and recorded "not very faint, small.  North of it is a small triangle of pB stars."  Caroline's reduced position is 8' north of UGC 5767, but his description clinches the identification.


John Herschel made three observations under h728 (first on 24 Feb1827), though apparently was uncertain if this was the same as his father's H. II-46, so assigned two different GC designations.  The NGC position is accurate and Dreyer comments in the Notes section that JH's and d'Arrest's positions agree.


Heinrich d'Arrest also found the galaxy on 21 Feb 1863, but made a 1 hour error in RA (uncovered by Harold Corwin).  Once corrected, the position of NGC 3760 matches NGC 3301 (the same error was made with NGC 3575).

24" (3/28/17): at 260x; faint, small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 24"x18", very low even surface brightness.  Easily the faintest of the 6 NGCs in the core of AGC 1060.  Situated 4.2' W of NGC 3309.


24" (2/22/14): at 260x, this member of AGC 1060 (Hydra I) appeared faint, small, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 24"x12", low even surface brightness.  Located in the core of the cluster, ~5' W of the NGC 3309/3311 pair and 9.5' NW of mag 6.6 HD 91964.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3307 = h3278 on 22 Mar 1836 and "eeF.  The 3rd of a group [with NGC 3285 and NGC 3270]."  He only recorded this object once in 4 different sweeps of the cluster and his position falls in a blank region, 5' south of ESO 501-031 = PGC 31430.  He commented in the Cape that his original figure was 5' further north but due to some confusion it was crossed out.  But the original declination matches ESO 501-031.  MCG does not label -04-25-029 as NGC 3307.  I am surprised the Herschel picked up this galaxy as it's easily the faintest one he saw in the cluster.

The core appears mottled with a couple of "stellarings" or small knots.  The core is surrounded by a larger, much lower surface brightness irregular halo, extending the central portion to nearly 2'.  An outer spiral arm is attached on the north side of the halo and was most evident near the halo.  Occasionally, a very large, very low surface brightness looping arm was glimpsed, rotating 180° clockwise and ending west of the core, ~1.7' from center.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3310 = H IV-60 = h731 on 12 Apr 1789 (sweep 919) and recorded "vB, R, planetary, but very ill-defined.  About 1' dia of it is equally bright, and 1/4 of a minute hazy or ill-defined round the margin."  His position is accurate. On 10 Feb 1831 (sweep 324), John Herschel wrote, "B; R; vsmbM, so as to for almost a disc 15" diam. Surrounded by a very feeble atmosphere."


On 5 Mar 1848, Lord Rosse and William Rambaut observed NGC 3310 (the earliest observation in LdR's 1861 monograph) and reported, "See minute points in it at intervals, also spiral arrangement well seen."  Their 11 Mar observation states, "Nebula well resolved into little stellar points.  Saw a broad band across the bottom distinctly and two at the top."  NGC 3310 was included in the list of nebulae exhibiting spiral structure.  Later observations mentioned the possibility of this object being a cluster.  A detailed observation was made on 20 Feb 1868: "Three principal branches f, nf and np towards a * np [probably a HII region].  Dark cavity on nf side.  Mr De la Rue, who was with me, saw it as a bay between 2 horns, and much neby surrounding it, with many stars exterior and involved.”

Edward Austin discovered NGC 3315 = HN 40, along with NGC 3097 and 3317, on 24 Mar 1870 with the 15" Merz refractor at the Harvard College Observatory (Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 13, #207).  There is nothing at his position. RNGC (as well as Laubert's 1981 ESO list) identifies ESO 501-047 as NGC 3315.  While this identication is possible, Austin mentioned a "star 1' NW" which does not apply to this galaxy and no mention is made of the bright star which would have interfered with the observation.


However, 30' N of Austin's position is ESO 501-048 at 10 37 19.2 -27 11 30 (2000) which has a 10th magnitude star 1' NW.  Based on Austin's visual description and a probable digit error in declination, this identification appears more likely and is the one used in ESO-Uppsala and RC3.  Corwin originally listed this number as a duplicate of NGC 3314 (which Austin observed the same night) but now agrees the 30' error in declination is was more likely.  This galaxy was listed by Knox-Shaw in a table of new nebulae (1912) found on plates taken at the Helwan Observatory between 1909-11.  The RNGC candidate for NGC 3315 is 17' south of ESO 501-048.

24" (2/22/14): this ~9" pair of stars (in the AGC 1060 field) was difficult to resolve at 260x (partially due to the low elevation) and seems more like a small nebulous glow.  It was resolved at 375x, though the (single) companion on the south side was quite faint (mag 15.5-15.8) and sometimes not distinctly seen as a star but as an indistinct glow.  The northern component (very close pair) was not resolved.


Edward Austin discovered NGC 3317 = HN 41, along with NGC 3097 and 3315, on 24 Mar 1870 with the 15" f/18 Merz refractor at Harvard College Observatory (Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 13, #210).  The description reads "nebulous star 5' N of [NGC 3316]".  Very close to Austin's position is a close double star, with the northern component an overlapping pair on the DSS.  RNGC classifies NGC 3317 as a double star (from Dorothy Carlson's paper) and a triple star in ESO/Uppsala (2+1).

The galaxy is sharply concentrated with a very bright, very elongated  high contrast bar, extending 1' SSW-NNE!  A fairly easy section of a spiral arm parallels the bar on the south side of the galaxy. A couple of easy knots, ~6" and 10" in size, along with a faint star, are at the SW end  of this arm [1.9' SSW of center].  The arm vaguely bends at a right angle to the NW and contains a bright, 12" knot [V = 16.6] . A low contrast arm is west of the bar, also running parallel (SSW-NNE).  Another low surface brightness arm is NE of the bar.  It curls sharply counterclockwise to the east and occasionally contained an extremely faint HII knot.

Francis Leavenworth independently discovered the galaxy on 3 Jan 1887 and reported it in list II-423 (and later NGC 3321).  Leavenworth's position is off by 35 tsec in RA too far west.  Howe was unsuccessful in searching for Common's object on twonights though he notes "Probably = NGC 3321 as their descriptions are fairly similar and their RA's agree fairly."

V = 6.7;  Size 16'


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I only took a quick look at the "Gabriela Mistral" Nebula at 200x and a UHC filter, but the brightest portion appeared like a cartoon drawing of a whale with a huge, very bright bulbous "head" forming the northern end of the nebula.  The brightest portion is perhaps 15'x6' in size, but quite an extensive amount of fainter nebulosity spreads out the east and southeast of the main body, significantly increasing the size to ~15'x11', elongated N-S.  Some faint nebulosity also spreads to the west of the main portion.  At the south end is the mag 5.5 star HD 92207.


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): striking HII region and cluster 30' SE of NGC 3293 and 90' NW of the center of the Eta Carina nebula! (this is an outlying piece of the Eta Carina complex)  At 105x and UHC filter this huge, elongated, irregular nebula is quite bright, perhaps 15'x6' in size and tapers towards the south end where mag 5.5 HD 92207 is embedded.  The nebula widens to a well-defined bulbous mass on the north end.  Faint nebulosity hooks off the north end and spreads to the east and northeast.  This HII region is ionized by mag 8 HD 92206 = h4338 (an 8.2/9.2 pair at 5") situated near the center of the nebula.  Unfiltered, a scattered group of stars is superimposed but this just appears to be a random star grouping in the Carina section of the Milky Way.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 3324 = D 322 = h3286 on 1 May 1826 and described a "star of the 7th magnitude, involved in faint nebula."  His position was roughly 6' NW of center of the nebula.


John Herschel credited Dunlop with the discovery and reported on 1 Apr 1834 "A double star involved in nebula, which is one of the outliers of the great nebula about Eta Argus. It extends to a star 6.7 mag half a field distant southwards, and almost as far north; pretty bright; irregular figure; fine object."


IC 2599, found by Williamina Fleming on a Harvard College Observatory plate in May 1893, refers to the southern portion of this nebula.

Christian Peters discovered NGC 3328 on 27 Mar 1880 with the 13.5" refractor at the Litchfield observatory in New York.  At his position is a mag 14.8 star with a fainter companion 20" west and there are no nearby objects he might have picked up.  Corwin equates NGC 3328 with this pair of stars.  On 21 May 1879 Wilhelm Tempel found an object ~30 seconds of RA preceding NGC 3332.  Near this location (mentioned in the narrative portion of paper V) is a pair of 15th magnitude stars.  In 1892 Spitaler measured an accurate position for Tempel's pair (given in the IC 1 Notes), but it's unlikely this pair is the same as NGC 3328.

John Herschel found NGC 3329 = h733 on 2 Sep 1828 (sweep 171) and recorded on 5 Apr 1832 (sweep 414), "pB; lE; gbM; 25"."  His position matches UGC 5837.


William Herschel discovered this galaxy on the problematic northern sweep 1096 on 2 Apr 1801, with large systematic errors.  His revised position, using Greenwich plates (MN, 71, 509), reveals NGC 3329 is identical to H I-284 = NGC 3397.  The modern designation is NGC 3329, despite the earlier discovery of NGC 3397.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, ~30 stars mag 10-13 in a 6'x3' group elongated N-S.  Three brighter mag 10 stars are on the south side but the main group of stars is on the north side including another mag 10 star.  This was an easy object in my 10x30 IS bincoculars and was partially resolved in the 9x50 finder.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): fairly faint but easily seen, a couple of stars were resolved at the edges.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 3330 = D 355 = h3287 on 29 Apr 1826 and described "a triangular group of small stars resembling faint nebula, with several stars in it of some considerable magnitude."  This was the first object he discovered with his homemade 9-inch speculum reflector after recording a few known objects.  JH recorded on 6 Apr 1834 "The chief star (9th mag) of a poor cluster of 20 or 30 stars."

William Herschel discovered NGC 3332 = H I-272 on 4 Mar 1796 while observing the satellites of Uranus (not in Caroline's fair copy of the sweeps).  This discovery was made after he abandoned his sweeps in 1794, although even by 1790 and married for two years they had become much less frequent.  He used Uranus as the reference for the offset and recorded "cB, S, iR, mbM, BN."  In the NGC notes, Dreyer states the nebula observed by Schönfeld on 26 Apr 1862 and by Vogel in 1867 differ a good deal in place from H I-272, while the vF neb found by Tempel in Arcetri on 21 May 1879 and by Peters (AN 3328) is nearly in Herschel's place.  The NGC position (also measured by Engelhardt) matches UGC 5807.


This galaxy was probably first discovered on 18 Jan 1784 (early sweep 83) and catalogued as H III-5 (later NGC 3342), but his position was very poor. See notes on NGC 3342.  Interestingly, this galaxy was also picked up by David Todd on 26 Feb 1878 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet, but his position for object #24 is about 3 tmin too far west!  Nevertheless, Todd's sketch is an exact match with the surrounding field stars for this galaxy.  Dreyer didn't include Todd #24 in the NGC.  So, it appears this galaxy was independently "discovered" 3 times.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3333 = h3288 on 2 Feb 1835 and noted "eF; vS; mE; appended like a tail to a * 15m."  His position and description match the edge-on galaxy ESO 376-002.


Swift probably found this galaxy again on 30 Dec 1897 and reported Sw. XI-115 as "eeeF; eeS; R; eF * in contact; sf of 2."  His position was only 1' SW of NGC 3333.  Herbert Howe has a note in his reexamination of NGC/IC objects around 1900 that "Swift says in a letter that these [Sw. XI-115 and 116] are to be dropped.  The former is evidently identical with the h nebula 3333.  The '* 15 att' is of mag. 13, and directly south of the nebula." As a result, Dreyer didn't assign an IC designation.  Finally, Swift called NGC 3333 the "sf of 2" in the large AN table and "f of 2" in his earlier lists, though its unclear what the other object he had in mind.  See Corwin's comments on NGC 3260 for more on Swift's objects.

See observing notes for NGC 3332.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3342 = H III-5 on 18 Jan 1784 (sweep 83) and gives the following long description: "The faintest and smallest nebula imaginable.  I viewed it a long while and with a higher power than the sweeper.  Having no person at the clock, I went in to write down the time and found it impossible to recover the nebula.  It appeared like a vS nebulous star, and is probably of the cometic sort; there was another vS star south-following (I think, or rather, am pretty sure), and it preceded a pB *.  It should have been secured before I went into the light.  Its place must be about 2 1/2 deg following rho Leonis and about 10 arcmin more north than that star.''


His position falls on a blank part of the sky, but Harold Corwin notes that WH's description matches NGC 3332 = H I-272, discovered on 4 Mar 1796 while observing the satellites of Uranus (not actively pursuing sweeps).  This implies his RA for III-5 was off by over 2 tmin of RA and 15' in dec, not an unusual error for his early sweeps.  This galaxy was independently found later by David Todd (#24) on 26 Feb 1878 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet.  Because of WH's poor position, this galaxy was not recovered by Spitaler or Bigourdan and Reinmuth equated the number with a mag 15 star.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3345 = h740 on 24 Mar 1830, while searching for his father's H I-26 (see below).  He simply noted "eF, hardly visible."  At his position is a pair of mag 14 stars at 18" separation.  Peters also reported the same position.  Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 paper on NGC corrections, identifies NGC 3345 as a double star.  As John's description was so disparate from his father's, Dreyer added two question marks to the equivalence of h740 with H I-26.


William Herschel found H I-26 on 19 Mar 1784 and recorded "cB, pL, not R, and much brighter about the middle than towards the ends."  There is nothing at his position, but ~10' south is M95, which was not observed in the sweep, and Dreyer notes in his 1912 notes to WH's catalogues that I-26 is probably a duplicate of M95.  Wolfgang Steinicke emphasizes the identity with M95, but Harold Corwin feels JH's observation should not be ignored.

17.5" (3/28/92): moderately bright but small, 1' diameter, slightly elongated E-W.  Unusual appearance because at first glance there appears to be a double nucleus.  Instead a mag 13.5 star is superimposed at the east side of the halo.  The core of the galaxy is close west and a small halo surrounds the star with averted vision.  Using direct vision the star is slightly brighter than the core.  A mag 11 star lies 1.7' WNW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3348 = H I-80 = h738 on 3 Apr 1785 (sweep 390) and noted "cB, S, irregularly elliptical."

48" (4/21/17): at 375x; extremely bright, very large, dominated by an intensely bright, round nucleus/core and a prominent central bar running nearly E-W.  A strong, round ring is attached at the ends of the bar, forming a striking "Theta" shape.  A well defined darker region is inside the ring to the north and south of the bar though the contrast is higher on the north side of the bar.  Surrounding the ring is a very large, low surface brightness outer halo extending SSW-NNE, perhaps 5.5'-6' by 4'.  With averted vision, low contrast spiral arm structure was noticed in the outer halo, particularly on the southwest side.


17.5" (2/28/87): very bright, very bright core. The outer halo is 4.5'x3.0' oriented SSW-NNE.  A bar is highly suspected extending WNW-ESE of the central core with inner ring structure suspected extending from this bar.   M96 (brightest in the group) lies 40' ENE.

Pierre Méchain discovered M95 = H I-26 = h743 on 20 Mar 1781.  WH observed M95 on 11 Mar 1784 (sweep 164) and recorded a "fine, bright nebula, much brighter in the middle than at the extremes, of a pretty considerable extent, perhaps 3 or 4' or more. The middle seems to be of the magnitude of 3 or 4 stars joined together, but not exactly round; from the brightest part of it there is a sudden transition to the nebulous part, so that I should call it cometic."


Just a week later (19 Mar 1784) he found H. I-26 and wrote, "cB, pL, not R, and much brighter about the middle than towards the ends."  There is nothing at his position, but ~20' south and 1 min of RA east is M95, which was not observed in the sweep, and Dreyer concludes in his 1912 revision of H's catalogoues that H I-26 is probably a duplicate of M95.


R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" on 16 Feb 1858, noted "I sev times thought it had two spiral arms, p and f."  Sir Robert Ball commented on 10 Feb 1867, "The central bright section seems rather more complex than usual.  It may be divided into two ellipses, the inner one is uniform in light and brighter than the other one."  This appears to describe the core and the surrounding inner ring.

Samuel Langley found NGC 3355 = HN 29 on 12 Apr 1866 using the 15-inch Merz Refractor at Harvard Observatory (Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 13, #215).  He simply noted "found in search for Biela's comet; place approximate."  There is nothing near his position (the only NGC credited to Langley).  NGC 3355 is not listed in any modern catalogue except ESO, which lists MCG -4-25-58 = ESO 501-G79 as a possible identity.  This galaxy is located 2 min of RA west and 11.4' south of Langley's position.


Harold Corwin suggests a more likely candidate is IC 625 = ESO 501-G80, a "normal'' early-type object with a surface brightness two magnitudes brighter than ESO 501-G79, which is located 45' south of Langley's position.  Either of these identifications are pretty speculative as they are not close to Langley's position.  So, I've listed this number as lost.

48" (2/21/12): at 375x, this beautiful barred spiral contains a prominent central bar extending ~1.3' N-S, with a bright, elongated core.  A spiral arm is attached at the south end of the bar.  It quickly rotates and sweeps northeast (clockwise) for 1.5', dimming out 1' E of center.  A longer, beautiful arm is attached on the north end of the bar and sweeps south along the west side of the galaxy.  This arm is brightest where it attaches to the bar.  The western arm passes well south of the central bar and includes a couple of HII knots towards the end.  The brightest is a faint 10" knot, situated 1.4' SW of center.  This HII region is catalogued as [H69] 42 in Hodge's 1969 paper "HII Regions in 20 Nearby Galaxies" and as SDSS J104627.95+631220.6 (V = 16.5).

Just south of this knot the arm fades out, but brightens slightly again at the tip (2' S of center), where there is a very faint, low surface brightness knot, ~12" diameter, listed in the RZB paper as region #12/14.

NGC 3366 is located just 1.7' S of mag 6.1 HD 91805 and the combination of low elevation and the glare of the bright star severely hampered viewing the galaxy.  At 225x I was able to place the star just outside the edge of the field which increased the visibility, though only viewed the brighter central region.  This galaxy is located 1.3° ENE of NGC 3256 and is probably part of the southern group Klemola 12 (NGC 3256, 3256B, 3261, 3262 and 3263 were observed from Costa Rica).

8" (3/28/81): bright, fairly large, slightly elongated.


Pierre Méchain discovered M96 = NGC 3368 = h749 on 20 Mar 1781.  Four nights later it was confirmed by Messier.  William Herschel observed M96 on 11 Mar 1784 (sweep 164) and recorded "A fine, bright nebula, much like the former [M95], but the brightest part in the middle is more joined to the nebulosity than in the former, and the bright part is rather longer, though not quite so vivid as in the former. It may still be called cometic, though it begins to depart a little from that kind."


Johnstone Stoney, LdR's assistant, noted "Is, I think, certainly a spiral." (3 Mar 1850).  A year later, Bindon Stoney added "vBM, perhaps shaped like an S reversed." A sketch clearly shows a spiral arm curving counterclockwise on the east side towards the south.  It also shows a darker strip just west of the central region between the western arm.  M96 was included in the list of "Spiral or curvilinear" nebulae in LdR's 1850 PT paper.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3371 = h751 on 23 Mar 1830 (sweep 282) and recorded "F, R. The second of 3 [with h748 and h753 = NGC 3373] in a triangle."  NGC 3367, situated ~7' WSW of JH's position, is the only galaxy in the vicinty.  But if his positions for all 3 objects are offset 73 seconds in RA east and 70' south, they match up perfectly with NGC 3379, NGC 3384 and NGC 3389.  Perhaps while observing NGC 3379, he used the position of NGC 3367 and measured offsets to obtain positions of other two galaxies.  So, h748 (sweep 282) = NGC 3379, NGC 3371 = NGC 3384 and NGC 3373 = NGC 3389.  His position angles (given under h748) also match these 3 galaxies.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.


NGC 3371 and 3373 were reported as not found by Pease on plates taken with the 60" reflector in 1917 and 1919.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this observation of the Homunculus was made at 350x in good seeing with the 24".  Eta Carinae appeared an iridescent electric-orange color surrounded by the bipolar blowouts of the Homunculus.  The brighter and larger lobe, which is expanding in our direction, extends to the southeast and was pretty circular (a bit flattened on the end), but punctured by a small, elongated hole that splits the lobe near Eta, creating a small 6" loop (connected on the SE end).  The NW blowout is fainter and smaller with an unusual "fountain" or "fan" appearance (also referred to as the "paddle" in schematics of the Homunculus), tapering in and dimming to an extremely narrow bridge at Eta and then spreading out to the NW.  The NW edge of this lobe is rounder, creating a "fan" appearance.  The two lobes create empty notches near Eta and extending into the NE notch between the two lobes is a very thin, short spike (referred to as equatorial debris or "skirt) that was not difficult to view but the SW "spike" was only intermittently visible.  Just west of Eta is the fairly prominent, dark "Keyhole Nebula".


18" (7/4/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): spectacular detail within the Homunculus nebula at 293x.  The bright 6" lobe to the SE of Eta is split by a dark lane (forming the two "legs" of the Homunculus).  This lane actually consists of two darker "holes" with the outer dark hole more prominent.  In moments of good seeing the outer periphery of the lobe has a slightly tattered or scalloped structure and it is flattened on the SE end.  Jutting out a few arcseconds to the NE is a small, thin spike that was visible continuously with averted vision.  On the opposite SW side, only a small, brighter extension or oval nodule bulges out slightly from the SE lobe.  The fainter NW lobe has a more translucent appearance with a pinched "key" or "bust" outline as the nebulosity is very weak or absent in the middle of the sides (this lobe forms the "head" of the Homunculus).  At the center of this remarkable sight is the bright, quasi-stellar, reddish-orange Eta Carinae.


Bochum 10 is located 40' NW of Eta Carinae and just north of the huge wedge of nebulosity that extends north of Eta. About two dozen stars, including 7 of 9th magnitude, were resolved in the main group, which extends ~5'x2'.  The cluster is fairly scattered and distributed in the two subgroups oriented NW and SE, with the SE group containing most of the stars.  Visually it was much smaller than the listed diameter of 20'.  Situated just 5' NW of mag 5.4 HD 92964 and just south of the southern arc of the HD 92809 Wolf-Rayet ring, which may be associated with Bochum 10.


This huge Wolf-Rayet bubble was surprisingly easy at 76x with an H-beta filter, although without prior knowledge I would have assumed it was an outer extension of the Eta Car nebula.  A huge, 35' semicircular annulus of nebulosity was easily traced.  The south side of the rim is bright, well defined and oriented roughly E-W as it passes north of Bochum 10.  With careful viewing, very faint nebulosity continues to spread out from the east end.  On the west side of this E-W strip, there is a short break and then it continues as a large, fairly prominent arc that curves northward.  This arc is sharply defined on both the interior and exterior edge and widens and fades at the north end, although a small locally brighter patch is at the NW tip.  The nebulosity curves back east on the north side but this section is quite faint and simply appears as low surface brightness haze.  A relatively prominent 4'x3' oval patch of nebulosity is isolated on the SE side, just within the interior.  Very faint haze also spreads out within the interior but the eastern half of the rim is completely missing. The OIII filter significantly dims the curving NW quadrant of the loop.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): I spent quite a bit of time on the Eta Carina complex, particularly examining the remarkable Homunculus Nebula. This is easily the largest bright emission nebula in the sky and a very prominent naked-eye object within the amazingly rich Carina Milky Way.  Dark lanes or rift separate bright islands of billowing nebulosity and the entire complex overfilled the 105x field at the eyepiece.


The surface brightness of the various sections is fairly uniform and pretty high, though it lowers in the outskirts.  No section is comparable in intensity to the central heart of the Orion Nebula, but the large wedge that contains Eta Car is quite prominent.  A UHC filter enhances the nebulosity without significantly dimming the stars.  Just west of Eta (within the central wedge) is the fairly prominent, dark "Keyhole Nebula" that extends ~5' length, elongated N-S (not as contrasty as when John Herschel named it in the 1830's).  Eta Carina's orange color and the small bipolar blowouts are quite stunning at high power.  Several clusters are involved with the nebula. The most prominent is Tr 16, situated just south of Eta Car.


Tr 14 is a rich group of ~30 stars mag 7 and fainter stars including the double star h4356 (7.2/8.9 at 2.8", with brighter component HD 93129A) within a 4' diameter.  There are several additional mag 8/9 stars and a swarm of mag 12 stars!  Tr 14 is situated just 12' NW of Eta Carinae within the bright, huge triangular section of nebulosity to the NW of Eta.  The cluster is the second most massive in the Carina nebula and contains ten O-type stars.  HD 93129Aa (the brighter spectroscopic component of HD 93129A) is one of the most luminous and massive known stars with ~80-100 solar masses and ~2,500,000 times the sun's luminosity.  The "Mystic Mountain" region, a remarkable star-forming pillar of gas and dust captured by the HST, is at the north edge of the cluster.


Tr 16 is the most massive cluster in the Carina nebula complex and contains the majority of the O-type stars.  Visually, Tr 16 is a rich group of stars trailing immediately south of Eta Carinae itself and close southeast of the dark Keyhole Nebula, all within the same bright triangular wedge.  At 166x, about three dozen stars mag 9-13 were resolved within 4'.  A number of the stars are arranged in chains and groups.  Eta Car itself is considered part of the cluster.  Mag 8.8 WR 25 = HD 93162 is about 7' W of center of the cluster.  The primary is considered the most luminous known star in our galaxy.


Tr 15 consists of roughly 15 stars (a half-dozen members are O-type supergiants) crammed into a 2' group including a neat triple h4364 (mag 8/9/11 at 8" and 9" in a string with brightest member HD 93249) on the north side.  Situated within a streamer of nebulosity just 20' NNW of Eta Carina itself.


At 200x, the Homunculus Nebula surrounding Eta Carina was remarkable in excellent seeing on the last evening of observing.  Both Eta and the nebula were a uniquely vivid color - an amazing fluorescent orange-tangerine.  Extending to the SE of Eta is the brighter lobe, perhaps 6" in diameter with a sharp outline that was flattened along the southern edge in a mushroom shape.  There appeared to be a partial darker lane in the interior.  Extending to the NW was a smaller (4"-5") and much fainter lobe that faded with increased magnification.  A tiny spike of nebulosity jutted out along to the NE between the two lobes.  A couple of very close and faint companions lie just NE of Eta.  This bi-polar reflection nebula resulted from the most recent outburst of supermassive Eta Car in 1841.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): Using a 20 Nagler (127x) and UHC filter, the field of Eta Carina was a breathtaking sight.  The outer wings and streamers extended well outside the 39' field.  The turbulent nebulosity had a curdled, electric appearance with a strong 3-dimensional effect as brighter streaks, wings, fainter masses and dark lanes were mixed together throughout the field.


The best overall view of the nebula in the 20" was at 80x (32 mm) using a UHC filter.  Even at this low power, the Eta Carina nebula still overfilled the field with contrasty dark lanes and amazingly structured islands of nebulosity.  I stared into the eyepiece quietly, somewhat stunned by its beauty.  With this aperture at 282x, the 12"x8" bipolar Homunculus nebula was an astounding sight.  The orange central star appeared quasi-stellar with the unequal blowouts fairly prominent.  They had an eerie, translucent appearance with the western lobe somewhat smaller, fainter and more pinched with the eastern lobe more circular.  A possible dark lane is near the center and punctures the lobes.


Tr 14 is a rich group of stars mag 7 and fainter stars in a 5' region, situated ~12' NW of Eta within one of the sections of nebulosity. Contains the binary h4356 (7.2/8.9 at 2.8").  The brighter spectroscopic member of the mag 7.2 star (HD 93129Aa) is one of the most massive stars known and rivals Eta Car in mass and luminosity.  A triple system h4360 just 2' SE includes a 2" pair.  Cr 232 is a small, scattered group of ~20 stars in a 4' region just following Tr 14.  The brightest star is mag 7.7 HD 93250, a 04-type supergiant.  Tr 16, the most massive cluster in the Carina complex, is a triangular group of stars just south of Eta and includes a chain of a half-dozen brighter stars.  Tr 15 is a fairly small group of a couple dozen stars mag 8.5 and fainter, less than 30' N of Eta Car. A half-dozen members are O-type supergiants.


Cr 228 is a large, scattered cluster ~25' SSW of Eta Carina in the southern part of the complex.  It includes two mag 6.5 stars with brightest member 6.2-6.5 QZ Carinae and the Wolf-Rayet star HD 93131.  Includes a number of mag 8-9 stars spread over a 15'x10' field.  The group is elongated SW-NE.


Bochum 10 is a group of two dozen stars in a ~5'x2' region.  It includes 7 mag 9 stars that dominate the group.  Fairly scattered and distributed in the two subgroups NW and SE with the SE group containing most of the stars.  Located just 5' NW of mag 5.4 HD 92964 and just south of the southern arc of the HD 92809 Wolf-Rayet ring.  Situated just north of the huge wedge that extends north of Eta, ~40' NW of the star.  Visually the cluster appears much smaller than the listed diameter of 20'.


At 282x, the 12"x8" bipolar Homunculus nebula surrounding Eta Carina was an astounding sight.  The orange central star appeared quasi-stellar with the unequal blowouts fairly prominent.  They had an eerie, translucent appearance with the NW lobe somewhat smaller, fainter and more pinched with the SE lobe more circular.  A possible dark lane is near the center and punctures the lobes.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): My first views of the Eta Carina nebula through Les Dalrymple's 12.5" and Gary's 20" were truly breathtaking and dwarfed the Orion Nebula in size and detail.  The nebula is broken into 4 or 5 main separate masses of varying sizes, shapes and surface brightness by three wide, dark obscuring dust lanes.  The mottled nebulosity has an amazing 3-dimensional curdled appearance and is riddled with dark bays and rifts.  Outer loops and brighter streaks complete an amazing vista.


The brightest section forms a triangular wedge isolated by prominent dark lane that cuts at a striking right angle.  This wedge contains the centerpiece Eta Carina which has an amazing orange color.  Extending from Eta are the two small lobes (one is brighter), referred to as the "Homunculus nebula" and appearing as an explosive event from the early 19th century in a HST image.  Just preceding Eta is an elongated N-S, curving dark lane nicknamed the "Keyhole Nebula" by John Herschel, as well as the open cluster Tr 16 just south of Eta.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered (telescopically) NGC 3372 = Lac III-6 = D 309 = h3295 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded a "Large group of a great number of small stars, little compressed, and filling out the space of a kind of a semi-circle of 15 to 20 minutes in diameter; with a slight nebulosity spreading in that space."  Of course, the nebula and embedded clusters is a prominent naked-eye object, so was certainly known by southern sky watchers.


James Dunlop observed it at least 13 times and recorded "(Eta Roboris Caroli, Bode) is a bright star of the 3rd magnitude, surrounded by a multitude of small stars, and pretty strong nebulosity; very similar in its nature to that in Orion, but not so bright... I can count twelve or fourteen extremely minute stars surrounding Eta in the space of about 1'; several of them appear close to the disk: there is a pretty bright small star about the 10th magnitude N.f. the Eta, and distant about 1'. The nebulosity is pretty strongly marked; that on the south side is very unequal in brightness, and the different portions of the nebulosity are completely detached, as represented in the figure [plate III, figure 14]. There is much nebulosity in this place, and very much extensive nebulosity throughout the Robur Caroli, which is also very rich in small stars."


John Herschel commented "It is not easy for language to convey a full impression of the beauty and sublimity of the spectacle which this nebula offers, as it enters the field of the telescope fixed in R. A., by the diurnal motion, ushered in as it is by so glorious and innumerable a procession of stars, to which it forms a sort of climax, and in a part of the heavens otherwise full of interest."


During a 5-year period in the 1840's and '50s Eta Car brightened from 1.5 to -1 (chronicled by John Herschel) and was temporarily the second brightest star in the sky, nearly rivaling Sirius. This outburst later created the double-lobed Homunculus Nebula, discovered in 1944.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, in 1863, Francis Abbott, an amateur in Tasmania, claimed a decrease in the size and brightness of the main nebula and displacement relative to Eta Car using a 4-inch refractor, but a number of critical replies followed by Lt. John Herschel (son of JH), Airy and Lassell.  Interestingly, the dark "Keyhole Nebula" does appear to have lost contrast based on JH's sketches and descriptions.


As far as the origin of the nickname "Keyhole Nebula" it's generally assumed that JH coined the phrase and his sketch of the elongated dark patch near Eta certainly appears like a perfect classic "keyhole".  But a search through his Cape Observations and articles about the brightening of Eta Car and possible variability of the nebula reveals he used the term "lemniscate" to describe the shape (must have been his early mathematical training).


In an 1873 issue of Appletons' Journal, Emma Converse, who reported on astronomical topics for the popular press, summarizes the dispute about changes in the nebula in an article titled "Eta Argus".  She mentions "In the middle of the brightest part of the nebulous light there was a dark vacancy, of a form resembling a keyhole, or the geometrical figure called a lemniscate, around which the light of the nebula was not uniform." Later she mentions "The southern loop of Herschel's lemniscate, or keyhole-shaped cavity had bulged out into the vacuity, forming an isthmus that trended north-south."  Agnes Mary Clerke refers to the "Key-Hole Nebula" in her "The System of the Stars" (second edition, 1905), plate XVII taken with the Bruce 24-inch at Arequipa in 1896.

Pierre Méchain discovered M105 = H I-17 = h757 on 24 Mar 1781, four days after he discovered M95 and M96.  It was discovered after Messier's final catalogue was sent to publication (in the 1784 Connaissance des temps) but was included in a letter dated 6 May 1783 to Johann Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch and published in the 1786 Jarbuch volume. Méchain wrote, "Mr. Messier reports in the Connoissance des temps 1784, p. 264 & 265 two nebulous stars, which I have discovered in the Leo [M95 and M96]; I find nothing to change for my positions which I have established by comparing these nebulae to Regulus; but there is also a third one to the north; it is a bit more beautiful [brighter] than the 2 others; I have discovered it on March 24, 1781, 4 or 5 days after the other two. On April 10, I compared it to Gamma Leonis & I have concluded the right ascension 159d 3' 45"; the declination 13d 43' 58" north."


William Herschel independently found M105 on 11 Mar 1784 (sweep 164) and recorded "Three nebula in the field together [with NGC 3384 and 3389].  The two preceding ones [M105 and NGC 3384] cometic and much like the two former bright ones [M95 and M96], but considerably less."  John Herschel's earliest observation was on 10 Apr 1825 (sweep 2).

William Herschel discovered NGC 3381 = H II-565 = h756 on 28 Mar 1786 (sweep 549) and logged "pB, cL, lbM, iF."  Caroline's reduced position is 10 seconds of RA west of UGC 5909.  John Herschel made two observations and three were made at Birr Castle.  On 8 Mar 1858, R.J. Mitchell noted, "I think there is a B streak through it."  This likely refers to the bar running east-west. The NGC description is in error stating "1st of 3", which applies to NGC 3379.

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 3382 on 5 Apr 1874 and described "About 4 min p [NGC 3432]. pF, cL, R, bM, *14 mag in centre. *9 Pos 238.0, Dist 173.7."  There is no nebula near his position. A second observation on 24 Mar 1878 reads "4m. p and 6'± n of [NGC 3432].  vF, S, irr R, only a S group of st, *9m Pos 192 deg, Dist 162.9"  This second position corresponds with a wide pair of mag 14/15 stars at 38" separation and a mag 10 star to the SSW (not mentioned in the first observation).  So this pair of stars might correspond to the second observation only or perhaps the reference galaxies were misidentified.  Dreyer didn't include this object in the GS Supplement.  See Harold Corwin's notes for further discussion.

24" (3/22/14): at 375x a faint unequal double star at 7" separation was resolved.  The brighter component on the SW side is mag 14.2 and the fainter component is mag ~15.5.  Although sometimes the pair was cleanly resolved into two sharp points, when the seeing was softer the fainter component appeared as a vague, dim spot so I can see how John Herschel might have called this pair a "suspected nebula".  Located 2.1' SE of NGC 3386 and 2.7' NNE of NGC 3385.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3387 = h762 on on 15 Mar 1830 and noted a "suspected nebula.  Has a bright star near." Just 30" northwest of his position is a 7" pair of mag ~14/15.5 stars and a mag 11 star (probably Herschel's "B* near") is 1.3' ENE.  There is a very faint galaxy less than 1' SW of pair, but it's almost certainly too faint to have been picked up by Herschel.


Harold Corwin notes that the NGC position is from Heinrich d'Arrest (single observation), who placed the nebula just off the southeast side of NGC 3386. He noted the observation was uncertain and there is nothing there.


The RNGC misidentified a mag 17.5 galaxy on the northwest edge of the halo of NGC 3386 as NGC 3387.  MCG and CGCG also misclassify NGC 3386/3387 as double nebula.  Corwin originally classified this 7" pair as a "star (SE) + compact galaxy (NW)?", but Brian Skiff confirms the northwest component is a star.  The brighter star is itself a 4" double with the fainter component 18th mag.

48" (5/4/16): this very bright, two-armed disrupted spiral forms an interacting, contact pair (Arp 270 = VV 246) with NGC 3396.  At 375x, it contains a large bright core that increases to the center.  On the north side of the core a spiral arm curls counterclockwise towards NGC 3396, nearly merging with the halo of the companion.  A brighter, more defined spiral arm is on the south side; it rotates sharply counterclockwise nearly 180°, ending on the east side of the galaxy.  A vague outer arm is at the south edge of the halo; it was visible as a low surface brightness extension to the southwest.


17.5" (3/12/94): fairly bright, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 1.5'x0.8', fairly high surface brightness, broadly concentrated halo, core appears rounder, no nucleus, mottled texture.  This galaxy is slightly larger and brighter of a striking interacting pair, almost in contact with NGC 3396 at the NNE end 1.6' from center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3395 = H I-116 = h765, along with NGC 3396, on 7 Dec 1785 (sweep 487).  He recorded, "Two, the 1st [NGC 3395] cB, the 2nd [NGC 3396] pB.  The 1st cL, the 2nd pL.  Both a little and irr E.  Their extent makes an angle, the vertex of which is towards the north about 1' from each other at the vertex."


R.J. Mitchell sketched the pair on 9 Feb 1855 and it was included in the LdR 1861 publication (plate XXVII, figure 15).  His description reads "[NGC 3395] is, I think, a spiral with a left-handed twist; immediately foll it is [NGC 3396], which is B and well defined, E pf.  I suspect F neby extending from 3395 and running up throiugh 3396."  The sketch showes a spiral arm wrapping 270° counterclockwise from the north, east and south side, ending west of the core.


Stephane Javelle found the galaxy on 13 May 1896 but made a sign error in the RA offset from his comparison star.  So, Dreyer assumed it was new and NGC 3395 was catalogued again as IC 2613.  IC 2605, discovered by Bigourdan on 11 Apr 1899, apparently refers to the southwest spiral arm.

Andrew Ainslie Common found NGC 3402 in 1880 with his 36-inch reflector.  There is nothing at his position, but 10 sec of RA east and 10' south is NGC 3411.  This galaxy was discovered by WH on 25 Mar 1786.  RNGC misidentifies PGC 32444 (a much fainter galaxy) as NGC 3402.  See Corwin's identification notes.

Andrew Common discovered NGC 3404 in 1880 with his 36-inch silvered-glass reflector.  There is nothing at his position but 15' south is MCG -02-28-011 and his description of "pB, very long, pos 270 deg [E-W]" is a good match with this galaxy.


Guillaume Bigourdan rediscovered this galaxy on 19 Apr 1898 while searching at Common's position, placed it correctly, and assumed it as new (Big. 403 = IC 2609).  MCG labels the galaxy IC 2609.  See Corwin's notes for more.

17.5" (4/22/95): fairly faint, fairly small.  At first glance appeared elongated 3:2 SW-NE but on closer inspection resolves into a very close pair of small faint galaxies with a 20" separation between centers.  The brighter component (NGC 3405) is at the southwest end and is very small and round.  The fainter member (MCG +03-28-015) is just barely separated at the northeast side.  NGC 3399 lies 4.0' WSW.  Forms an perfect equilateral triangle with two mag 13 stars 1.7' SW and 1.7' SSE.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 3405 = m 206 on 1 Apr 1864 and noted "F, eS, alm stell, close to S*."   Marth's position is 1.0 tmin east of UGC 5933.  The same offet error was made with NGCC 3399.  This is a double system; 0.7' x 0.7' + 0.2' x 0.2', with a separation of 0.35' SW-NE.

On 1 Apr 1878 Dreyer observed the field again, discovered nearby NGC 3410, and noted "preceding one [NGC 3406] pB, pL irr R gmbM.  2 points of condensation, brighter one sp centre..."  The fainter northeast nucleus is the merged companion LEDA 93106, though for some reason Dreyer didn't even note the galaxy as double in the NGC description.

A micrometric position was published in list V-7.  The NGC position matches UGC 5964.


The original discovery, though, was made by William Herschel on 14 Jan 1787 (sweep 691) and noted as "vF, vS, most likely a small patch."  His position (CH's reduction) is 2.7' southwest of the galaxy.  As the observation was uncertain, it was never published and he was not credited in the NGC.

48" (4/16/15): very bright, large, slightly elongated SW-NE, ~3'x2.5', large bright core. A mag 15.8 star is superimposed on the SSW side, 1.2' from center.  Spiral structure is evident at 488x, particularly along a curving outer arm running from clockwise from east to north.  This arm contains three HII knots.


An obvious faint knot, 8"-10" diameter, is at the north end 1.1' from center.  The brightest knot is at the northeast end of the halo 1.1' from center, and it appeared fairly faint/faint, round, 12" diameter.  The faintest knot (SDSS J105118.10+055024.7) is directly east of center by 1.0' and noted as very faint, round, 6" diameter.  In addition to these three, a 4th knot is due south of center by 0.6'.  This HII region was very faint, round, 8" diameter.


Two additional objects were seen just off the south side of NGC 3423, but these are separate galaxies.  2MASX J10511769+0548323, situated 2.0' SE of the center, is fairly faint to moderately bright (V = 15.7), small, round, moderate surface brightness, 15" diameter. 2MASX J10511769+0548323, 2.0' S of center, is very faint (V = 17.1), very small, ~9"x6" SW-NE.  This latter galaxy has a redshift of z = .069 and lies far in the background at a light-travel time of ~920 million years.


17.5" (4/6/91): moderately bright, fairly large, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, 3'x2', fairly low surface brightness, elongated bright core appears offset to the west.  Has a faint halo which seems more extensive to the east of the core.  Two mag 12/13 stars are off the NE edge with the mag 12 star 2.4' from the center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3423 = H IV-6 = H II-131 = h777 on 23 Feb 1784 (sweep 157) and recorded IV-6 as "F, L, cometic with a bright point in the center.  The nebulous part is eF."  His RA was 30 seconds too large. He found the nebula again on 13 Apr 1784 (sweep 191) and logged H. II-131 as "pB, vL, almost R, lbM, r."  The RA on this sweep was 1 min too large and 5' too far south.  Another observation was made on 2 Feb 1786 (sweep 521): "pB, vL, R, vgbM, about 5' dia."


John Herschel made 3 observations under h777 and equated his father's two entries, though he mistakenly also equated H. III-88 (NGC 3401). While compiling the NGC, Dreyer sorted out the identities IV-6 = II-131 = h777 = NGC 3423.


Bindon Stoney, observing on 7 Mar 1851 at Birr Castle, noted "2 knots [HII regions] on n side."  On the 29 Mar 1856 observation, R.J. Mitchell noted a "star in the south edge, another fainter in f edge, 2 knots in n edge.  I think it is resolvable."

William Herschel discovered NGC 3425 = H III-108 = T I-28 on 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 197) and noted "eF, eS, r."  There is nothing at his position, but 30 sec of RA west and 3' north is UGC 5967 = PGC 32555.


Wilhelm Tempel couldn't find H III-108 at H's position in 1877, but instead found two nebulae and assumed one was Herschel's III-108.  Dreyer chose the slightly brighter northern nebula as III-108 and catalogued T I-29 as NGC 3427.  Andrew Common's NGC 3388 (found in 1880) may be a duplicate observation of NGC 3425 (equivalence suggested by Harold Corwin).

David Todd independently discovered this galaxy on 11 Nov 1877 and listed it as object #4 in AN 2698 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet.  The surrounding field stars match this galaxy.  Tempel didn't give a specific date in list I, so either Tempel or Todd could be the discoverer.

See observing notes for NGC 3428.  Identification uncertain.


Andrew Ainslie Common discovered NGC 3429 in 1880 using his 36-inch silvered glass reflector.  His position is just 3 sec of RA east and 1' south of NGC 3428, which was discoverd by Marth on 25 Mar 1865.  So, likely NGC 3429 is a duplicate observation of this galaxy.


RNGC misidentifies PGC 32510 as NGC 3429.  This is a much fainter galaxy 8' WSW as NGC 3429.  Alister Ling and Harold Corwin feel the RNGC identification is unlikely and Common more likely recorded NGC 3428, the brighter of the pair.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3430 = H I-118 = h779 = 782 on 7 Dec 1785 (sweep 487) and recorded "cB, cL, iR, mbB."  There was apparently an error of 1 degree with his offset from 46 UMa as NGC 3424 was the previous object in the sweep, so both would have been picked up together.


John Herschel found NGC 3430 = h779 on 6 Mar 1828 (sweep 128), logged it as a Nova with description "B; L; E; gbM; the nf of 2 [with NGC 3424]."  Still looking for his father's H. I-118, he recorded it again as h782 on 3 Apr 1831 as a "Nova or I. 118" and described "B; L; the nf of 3 on a line [with NGC 3413 and NGC 3424].  The neb may possibly be I. II8 as none exists in the place indicated by my Father."  JH added designations for both of his observations in the GC, as well as one for his Father's I-118.  He has a long note in the GC that there was probaby a one degree error in his father's sweep.  By the time of the NGC, Dreyer sorted things out and equated NGC 3430 = H. I-118 with GC 2236 and 2239, though 2233 is also an alias.


In Feb and Apr of 1855, R.J. Mitchell (Lord Rosse's observer), reported seeing a possible "dark bay" south or southwest of the nucleus.  Photographs shows this is a darker gap between the core region and the southern spiral arm.

But the star at the east edge of the middle is only single.  Rudolph Spitaler measured the position of a knot or HII region at the northeast end in an observation at Vienna in 1891.

NGC 3446 = ESO 264-045

10 52 07 -45 08 24; Vel

Size 7'


14" (4/2/16 - Coonabarabran, 123x and 160x): ~30 stars visible in a 6' group with a mag 8.7 star at the northeast corner. The richest part is a 3'x1' group elongated NW-SE on the northeast side of the cluster.  This subgroup includes a mag 10.6 star.  An unequal mag 10.2/13 pair at 19" is on the south side with another mag 10.5 star ~45" SW.  The brightest star in the field is mag 8.4 at ~10' NW.


The galaxy ESO 264-047 is situated just off the east side of the cluster, 2' E of the mag 10.6 star mentioned above.  It appeared very faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.


24" (2/22/14): viewed on the meridian at an elevation of 8°, but not an optimal view.  At 200x, mag 8.7 SAO 222386 is at the NW edge.  A group of ~20 stars is south and east including four mag 10-11 stars in a 7' region.  The ESO galaxy just off the east edge was not seen.  Mag 8.4 HD 94198 is roughly 10' NW.  A number of stars are also scattered around this star including a couple of brighter ones, but this seems like an unrelated, random gathering.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3446 = h3301 on 15 Mar 1836 and recorded "The chief * (9m) of a cluster class VIII, 7' dia, not rich or comp.  Stars 10...13."


Brian Skiff gives a position of 10 52 07 -45 08.3 centered on CoD-44 6866 (mv 9.0) and suggests a diameter of 15' if a few bright stars to the west are included, though Herschel's "chief *" is part of a 7' group.  The galaxy ESO 264-G47 is at the east side, though was missed by Herschel.  RNGC classifies this object as non-existent.

48" (5/16/12): this interacting starburst galaxy appeared very bright, large, very elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, high surface brightness, irregular shape, mottled appearance.  At the northeast end of the galaxy is a large, bright knot, ~25"x12", which is possibly the disrupted core of the galaxy.  Occasionally an extremely faint tidal tail could be glimpsed, extending perhaps 1.5' ENE.  The beginning of the tail near the bright knot was easily seen.  At the very tip was a marginally visible galaxy, perhaps glimpsed a couple of times.  The dim tail extends the length from 2.4' to 3.6'.


NGC 3448 is interacting with UGC 6016, a low surface brightness dwarf galaxy, 4.1' WSW.  The companion appeared as a faint to fairly faint, low surface brightness patch, elongated SW-NE (in the direction of NGC 3448) , ~1.2'x0.5', no concentration.

Bailey was the President of the Astronomical Society of London at the time and a regular guest of Herschel.  The position is an excellent match (0.9' SE) with UGC 6030, though the description doesn't match this fairly bright galaxy.  It applies well, though, to IC 656, a small clump consisting of three faint stars and a dim galaxy just 4' E, though how could the more prominent galaxy be missed?


R.J. Mitchell also observed UGC 6030 on 27 Mar 1854 using LdR's 72" and noted a "A S neb [NGC 3461] north of a bright one [UGC 6030], distance about 5' or 6'."


Lewis Swift also recorded this galaxy on 24 Aug 1883, though his position in list I-9 is 25 sec of RA too far east.  Swift's and LdR's observations were combined by Dreyer into NGC 3460.  So, most likely NGC 3457 = NGC 3460, despite the very poor description of NGC 3457 (perhaps Bailey noted the clump, but JH measured the galaxy).  See Harold Corwin's discussion.

Lewis Swift also recorded this galaxy on 24 Aug 1883 in list I-9, though his position is 25 sec of RA too far east.  These two observations were combined into NGC 3460.


Most likely John Herschel or observing guest Francis Baily first discovered this galaxy on 25 Mar 1827, and it was catalogued as h793 = NGC 3457.  The Slough Catalogue position is accurate, though the description "Stellar. 2 or 3 stars with a nebulous blur observed by Mr. Bailey", appears to describe IC 656, a small clump consisting of three faint stars and a dim galaxy just 4' east.


Mitchell's observation clearly refers to NGC 3460 = UGC 6030 and NGC 3461.  Later, on 22 Mar 1878, Dreyer mentions finding an "eS cl , with a *12 in Pos 175 deg, dist 305 arcsec".  It's most likely that this observation is not related to the galaxy but may refer to the 3 faint stars + galaxy 4.5' following NGC 3457 (mentioned above).

William Herschel discovered NGC 3465 = H III-967 = h795, along with H III-968, on 2 Apr 1801 (sweep 1096).  He only recorded a single position and noted "Two, the 1st [NGC 3465] vF, vS.  The 2nd eF and smaller than the first.  It is a little more north and following, but very near to it." This is one of 15 far northern galaxies with large systematic errors.  A corrected position matching UGC 6056 and 6090 was published in 1911 using plates taken at the Greenwich Observatory with the 30-inch reflector.  Dreyer repeated the corrected positions in the notes to his 1912 edition of WH's catalogues.  In the NGC, Dreyer assigned both III-967 and III-968 to NGC 3500 (calling it a "D neb, v near").


John Herschel independently discovered NGC 3465 on 4 Apr 1832 and logged h795 as "eF; pL; R; vglbM; 30", a double star nf points to it."  His position and description clearly applies to UGC 6056.  JH was credited with the discovery of NGC 3465 in the GC and NGC, though his father should probably receive credit.  See NGC 2938 for more on this sweep.

Christian Peters discovered NGC 3492 around 1880 with the 13.5" refractor at the Litchfield observatory in New York. It was not published in either of his two lists of 1881 and 1882, so the discovery was probably communicated directly to Dreyer.  His NGC position matches UGC 6094.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 3494 in 1882 and described in his 5th paper "6' north from the middle knot [of NGC 3495] I saw repeated a little nebula, I initially took as (part of) III-498 [NGC 3495]."  There are no nearby galaxies at this offset and Harold Corwin proposes a 5" pair of mag 14.5/16.7 stars located 9' north-northwest of NGC 3495.


Dorothy Carlson listed NGC 3494 as nonexistent in her 1940 NGC Correction paper and RNGC repeats this classification.  See Corwin's notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3495 = H III-498 = h809 on 27 Jan 1786 (sweep 513) and noted "vF, mE."  His position is accurate (very close to the offset star 58 Leo).

The cluster is beautifully rich with mag 12 and fainter stars, roughly 60-75 stars in a 5'-6' circular region (this is the richest section) and 100-125 stars within a 9' region elongated E-W.  On the east side is HJ 4395 = 11.5/12.0 pair at 9" and a small knot of stars is on the northwest side. A mag 9.3 star is off the east side and a mag 9.2 star is off the south side. Located 34' ENE of 6th magnitude T Carinae and 80' WNW of NGC 3572.


Sher 1, a very small cluster, is 13' NE of NGC 3496. Using an 18" f/4.5 at 182x it appeared as a small 1' knot of ~10 stars including a few bright mag 9.5-11 stars, but several are very faint.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3496 = h3310 on 14 Mar 1834 and recorded the "Place of a small double star in the following part of a loose, rich, pretty large cluster of stars 13m.  8 or 10' in diameter; a fine object; a very much condensed milky way group."

William Herschel discovered NGC 3497 = H III-824 on 8 Mar 1790 (sweep 936) and logged "vF, vS, iR, glbM."  His position is within 2' (typical error) of ESO 570-006 = PGC 33667.  The position in the GC, which was copied into the NGC, is 6 min too far west (reduction or copying error).


JH independently discovered this galaxy on 22 Mar 1835 and logged h3316 as "F; S; R; pslbM; 20".  The preceding of two [with NGC 3529]."  His position is 6 sec of RA west of ESO 570-006.   Ormond Stone independently found this galaxy in 1886 at the Leander-McCormick Observatory and his rough position for LM 1-183 (nearest min of RA) is 1.0 tmin west of ESO 570-006.  Finally, Lewis Swift rediscovered this galaxy again (along with NGC 3529) on 11 Apr 1898 and his position in list XI-118 is 5' too far south (nearly identical to NGC 3529).


So, there are four aliases in the NGC/IC!  Namely, NGC 3497 = NGC 3528 = NGC 3525 = IC 2624.  NGC 3528 is the primary designation in modern catalogues.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3498 = H III-75 on 8 Apr 1784 (sweep 187) and recorded "eF, not S.  I had some doubts and therefore put on 240, but as there was not a star very near I could not adjust the focus, which cannot be done on a nebula.  Therefore as it would have taken too much time to verify it, I went on."


There is nothing near his position and neither d'Arrest nor Bigourdan were able to find this nebula.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel" reported "In Dreyer's place is a vF triple star, *14.7, *14.7, *16, a *14.7 f 1.8' of *16."  The DSS shows a triple star with a brighter pair of mag 14.2/14.6 stars at 10" separation.  Harold Corwin also identifies this number with this triple.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3500 = H III-968, along with H III-967, on 2 Apr 1801 (sweep 1096).  He noted "Two, the 1st [NGC 3465] vF, vS.  The 2nd [NGC 3500] eF and smaller than the first.  It is a little more north and following, but very near to it." This is one of 15 far northern galaxies with large systematic errors  A corrected position matching UGC 6090 was published in 1911 using plates taken at the Greenwich Observatory with the 30-inch reflector.  Dreyer repeated this position in the notes to his 1912 edition of WH's catalogues.  John Herschel assigned two GC designations to III-967 and III-968, but in the NGC Dreyer mistakenly assigned both to NGC 3500, calling it a "double nebula, very near."  See NGC 2938 for more on this sweep.


UGC 6090 is not labeled as NGC 3500 in any modern catalogue including RC3.  RNGC classifies NGC 3500 nonexistent. CGCG, UGC and PGC equate "NGC 3465 = NGC 3500" (following Karl Reinmuth and Dorothy Carlson).  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): The brightest section of this nebulosity surrounds a group of 5 stars, consisting of a brighter mag 10.5 star with a faint, close companion (h4397 = 10.6/13.3 at 8") and three additional stars in a string. Several additional faint stars spiral out from the grouping.  The haze that surrounds these 5 stars is ~3' in diameter.  There was little or no contrast gain using a UHC filter, so the nebulosity does not have a significant emission component.  Situated in a rich star field.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3503 = h3311 on 1 Apr 1834 and described "3 very close stars, 10m, in a nearly straight line, and a double star north of them, the whole involved in a very faint nebula."  Paris Pismis reported it as new in her 1959 list of 24 new clusters found with the Schmidt camera at the Tonantzila observatory and noted "Quadruple star in nebulosity plus five faint stars; is the center of arcs that extend up 15'.

Lewis Swift found this galaxy on 14 Jan 1898 and claimed it as new in list XI-117 (later IC 2622).  Swift's position was 0.5 min of RA too far east and 3' north, so Dreyer didn't make the equivalence.   Also see the NGC 3505, which may be another observation of this galaxy.

48" (2/20/12): NGC 3509 = Arp 335 displayed a fascinating amount of structure at 375x, though conditions were subpar in terms of transparency and seeing.  The appearance is very asymmetric with the brighter "central" portion elongated SW-NE and containing a very small, round, bright core.  A small knot is just 15" S of the core.  Attached on the northeast side of the central body is a well defined, easily visible tidal arm that gracefully sweeps to the northeast and then hooks sharply counterclockwise towards the south.  The total length of the arm is perhaps 1.5', though it ends about 45" E of the core.  The southwest side of the galaxy has no corresponding arm, but is slightly brighter along the south edge. A mag 16.5-17 star is 30" SW of the core on the west edge.


PGC 93108, recorded as "fairly faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, ~15"x7", weak central concentration", lies 3.0' NW.  The PGC galaxy is listed as C2 (collider) in the 2009 Atlas and Catalog of Collisional Ring Galaxies (Madore et al) and the knot close south of the core is listed as C1.


17.5" (4/1/95): fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 5:2 SSW-NNE, 1.6'x0.7'.  Low surface brightness with a very weak concentration (no visible core).  It was difficult to determine the outer extent of the halo but appears to have an asymmetric shape (slightly curved?).


William Herschel discovered NGC 3509 = H III-598 on 30 Dec 1786 (sweep 675) and recorded "Suspected, eF, S, lE.  I could not verify it."  There is nothing at his position, but 1.0 min of RA east and 3' north is UGC 6134 = Arp 335.  JH made no observations and it was not found by Bigourdan.


Dreyer commented in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH" that this number should probably be rejected since WH noted there was fog "which indeed was so strong as to make everything swim about me."  Still, this identification is reasonable as NGC 3604 has a similar offset error.

The region surrounding the core is mottled, due to slightly brighter regions and dust patches.  An ill defined broad spiral arm is on the west side of galaxy and curved from north to south.  A mag 14 star, 2.0' SW of center, was barely off the southwest end of this arm.  A bright patch is 1' SW of center (not part of the arm), and just to its north was a relatively large darker (dust) region.  A second broad arm arc was visible at the east end of the galaxy.

48" (4/18/15): at 488x and 610x; this superb barred spiral has a strong bright bar oriented northwest to southeast.  It is brighter along a narrow spine and contains a slightly brighter stellar nucleus.  A prominent spiral arm is attached to the bar at the southeast end and sweeps sharply to the north.  This well defined arm is relatively narrow and contains a small bright knot near the north end of the arm.  A second arm is attached at the northwest end of the bar.  This narrow arm shoots due south and rotates nearly 180° clockwise to the east on the south side of galaxy.  It is slightly more separated from the central region than the northern arm and is patchy or knotty near the eastern end.  Overall, the size is roughly 2.5'x2.0', extending northwest to southeast. A mag 15 star is 1.2' W of center, a mag 13 star is 1.7' E of center and a mag 17 star is just off the north side of the galaxy.


17.5" (4/1/95): fairly faint, moderately large, 2.5'x2.0', irregular surface brightness, only a slight central brightening.  A mag 13.5 star is 1.7' E of center.  A line of three equally spaced mag 11 stars lies about 4' S.  Forms a pair with NGC 3511 10.8' NW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3513 = H V-40 on 21 Dec 1786 (sweep 660) and recorded "vF, mE, vlbM, about 7' l and 3 or 4' br in the middle, about 10 or 15° from sp to nf near the parallel.  His position matches ESO 502-014 = PGC 33410, so the identification is certain, but the description is virtually identical to that of NGC 3511, which was the previous object in the sweep!  So, there was apparently a mistake in copying the description for NGC 3511 twice.


Based on a photograph taken with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector between 1912-14, Harold Knox-Shaw stated it was a "S-Shaped spiral".

14" (4/5/16 - Coonabarabran, 145x and 178x): roughly 80 stars resolved in an irregular 6' region (boundary pretty arbitrary), many of these arranged in chains or curving streamers of stars.  On the west side is the brightest mag 9.7 star (mag 12.5 companion at 8" = HJ 4400) with a linear chain of mag 13 stars just west (oriented SW-NE).  Another chain of mag 12-13 stars (oriented NW-SE) is on the northeast side.  A mag 7.4 star (HD 96193) is roughly 8' SSE and a long chain of stars heads north from this bright star, reaching the south side of the cluster.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3519 = h3314 on 14 Mar 1834 and reported, "Chief star of a pretty rich cluster, class VII."  His position match the unequal double star HJ 4400 within a small cluster.


According to Brian Skiff, Ru 93 appears to be a string of stars on the northeast side of the cluster or may simply be a duplicate of NGC 3519.  In a visual observation with a C-8, Jenni Kay observed about two dozen stars in a single cluster of 5' diameter with two brighter stars at the southwest edge. RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent, though the group was confirmed as a star cluster by Bica and Bonatto in 2011A&A...530A..32B ("Star clusters or asterisms? 2MASS CMD and structural analyses of 15 challenging targets.")

This is a close double system [9" between centers] but was not resolved at 260x.  The NGC identification is uncertain due to a poor position.

Just 2' north of his position is a 1' group of four stars (brightest two are mag 13 and 14.5) and originally Harold Corwin identified this group as NGC 3520.  He now feels a more likely match based on the description is ESO 570-004 = PGC 33648, an interacting triple or quadruple system located 1.6 min of RA east and 5' south of Leavenworth's position.

The galaxy appeared extremely bright, very large, elongated ~5:2 NNW-SSE, at least 8'x3.2', sharply concentrated with a very bright, elongated core.  The core itself was sharply concentrated with a brilliant quasi-stellar nucleus!  A high contrast, fairly wide dust lane runs in the direction of the major axis along the entire west side of the core!  The principal spiral arm was easily visible emerging NNW from the NE side of the central region.  This arm displayed a hard outer edge (high contrast) and curved sharply clockwise on the north end.  The arm dimmed or lost contrast but could be traced to the west of the dust lane, extending south.  The galaxy was slightly brighter at the south end (along the major axis), where the opposite arm curled east and north.


18" (5/14/07): very bright spiral with impressive structure, elongated at least 5:2 NNW-SSE, ~7.5'x3'.  Contains a bright, elongated core highlighted by an intense, stellar nucleus.  The halo is noticeably mottled at first glance and a low contrast dust lane runs NNW-SSE along the west side of the core.  There is a strong impression of spiral structure with an arm attached on the east side that extends to the north and appears to curve towards the west in the outer halo.  The halo appears more extensive or slightly brighter on the northern end.  A more difficult arm appears to sweep to the south on the west side of the core.


17.5" (1/19/91): very bright, very large, elongated 5'x2' NNW-SSE.  This is an impressive galaxy!  Contains a well-defined small bright oval core NNW-SSE and a stellar nucleus.  Appears mottled near the core and on the west side.  Along the west side is a dust lane evident as a sharp light cut-off.  The west side is somewhat fainter due to dust but extends beyond the dust lane.

The central region is condensed and quite rich with several dense knots consisting of pairs, triples, chains, etc.  The brighter stars are extended ~E-W and includes 6th magnitude K2-type star (HD 96544).  There is no well-defined edge to this immense cluster although a huge "U" shaped chain of stars extends around the periphery.  A neat equal-mag equilateral triangle of stars stood out within the central maze of stars.


The cluster is quite prominent naked-eye as a 45' cloud just 3° ENE of Eta Carina in the NE corner of the rich Carina starcloud and was densely packed with dozens of resolved stars in the 9x50mm finder.  Mag 3.9 V382 Carinae (a Delta Cepheid variable not considered a cluster member) is just off the SE side.


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This spectacular naked-eye and binocular cluster (3° ENE of Eta Carina) filled the entire 51' field of the 27mm Panoptic (76x) with several hundred stars mag 7 and fainter resolved.  The cluster is unusually elongated ~E-W, perhaps 55'x30' and widening on the following side.  The stars are irregularly distributed with many in pairs, small groups, chains and loops.  A group of about a dozen stars forms a perfect "S" asterism.  Interestingly, there is a lack of dense knots although the entire central region is rich.  Many of the stars appear to have a blue or yellowish tint.  This is one of the very top open clusters in the sky although it is probably best in a wider field view.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): absolutely stunning cluster - very prominent naked-eye, rivals nearby Eta Carina though smaller.  A couple of dozen stars were resolved in 10x30mm binoculars including a few very bright stars.  Some additional faint stars scintillated in and out of view.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 3532 = Lac II-10 = D 323 = h3315 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He described a "prodigious number of faint stars forming a semi-circle of 20 to 25 minutes diameter."


James Dunlop observed the cluster 3 times (including first night of logging on 27 Apr 1826) and described "a very large cluster of stars about the 9th magnitude, with a red star of the 7-8th magnitude, north following the centre of the cluster. Elliptical figure: the stars are pretty regularly scattered."


John Herschel was very impressed with the cluster, including it in a list of 'greatest hits': "Among the nebulae which occur from 9h to 12h we have .. the beautiful planetary nebula [NGC 2867], a perfect planet in appearance, with an attendant satellite; the falcated nebula [NGC 3199]; Eta Argus with its nebula; the superb cluster [NGC 3532]; the blue [Herschel's italics] planetary nebula [NGC 3918], a most exquisite and unique object ; and the beautiful cluster of various coloured stars about Kappa Crucis [NGC 4755]."


His first sweep on 31 Mar 1834 reported "Chief star of a very large, round, loosely scattered cluster of stars 8..12th magnitude, which fills 2 or 3 fields. A fine bright object." His next observation recorded "The chief star of a superb cluster, which has several elegant double stars, and many orange-coloured ones." On 5 Feb 1835 (sweep 543, the night described in his diary as "most superb" and "having attained the sublime of Astronomy - a sort of ne plus ultra") he wrote,"A glorious cluster of immense magnitude, being at least 2 fields in extent every way. The stars are 8, 9, 10 and 11 mag, but chiefly 10th magnitude, of which there must be at least 200. It is the most brilliant object of the kind I have ever seen."

His rough discovery position is 12' north of MCG -02-29-004 and 15' south of MCG -02-29-003.  Both of these galaxies are possible candidates.  Harold Corwin feels that based on Common's description, MCG -02-29-003 = PGC 33759 is more likely.

Ormond Stone found NGC 3544 = LM 1-184 on 7 Jan 1886 at Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at his rough position (nearest minute of RA) but 2 minutes of RA east (same dec) is NGC 3571 = ESO 570-011 and Stone's position angle (95°) and dimensions (2.5'x0.4') are a perfect match with NGC 3571.


This galaxy was discovered by William Herschel on 8 Mar 1790 and catalogued as II-819 (later NGC 3571).  So, NGC 3544 = NGC 3571.  Harold Knox-Shaw noted the equivalence in 1915, based on photographs taken at the Helwan Observatory in 1912-14 with the 30" Reynolds reflector.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 3551 = Sw. I-10, along with Sw. I-11 = NGC 3555 on 24 Aug 1883, and noted "eeF; vS; R; diff; s of 2."  His position is 50 sec of RA east of CGCG 125-032 (close pair) but similar in declination.  His relative separation with NGC 3555 is 10 sec of RA and 0.5' north.  This suggests NGC 3555 = UGC 6203 (brightest in the cluster), though the actual RA difference is 3.2 tsec of RA.  CGCG 125-032 is not labeled NGC 3551 in UGC (notes) or CGCG.  RNGC and PGC identify the brighter western component of this double as NGC 3551.


As an alternative identification, Corwin suggests that NGC 3551 = UGC 6203 and NGC 3555 = CGCG 125-034, but the declination separation of 3' is much larger than Swift's 0.5'.  I feel this solution is less likely.

John Herschel made 3 observations, describing this object on sweep 65 as "so excessively faint as hardly to be discerned on long attention.  The second of a group of 3 [with NGC 3561]."


Hermann Kobold measured micrometric positions of the cluster in 1902 with the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg, but nothing is at his position for NGC 3552, so he likely misidentified the offset star.  Also see notes on NGC 3553.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 3553 = Big 45 on 13 Mar 1885 and recorded "20" diam; forms a double nebula with GC 2320 [NGC 3552]."  His position, though, matches NGC 3552, as he assumed the galaxy 0.7' southwest (MCG +05-27-003 = PGC 1842970) was NGC 3552.  So, the positions in the NGC for NGC 3552 and NGC 3553 actually apply to the same galaxy.  Since Bigourdan clearly discovered MCG +05-27-003, Harold Corwin suggests it should be labeled NGC 3553.

48" (5/12/12): extremely bright and large, very elongated at least 4:1 WSW-ESE, ~8'x2'.  M109 displayed a unique tortured appearance and was riddled with irregular dust lanes and patches.  A very irregular dust lane courses through the galaxy along the major axis, but north of the core.  A bright mag 12.5 Milky Way star is superimposed just west of center and east of this star is a bright, large elongated knot [HK83] 87.  Very close west of the star is a small, faint knot [HK83] 108 and a large dust patch is just west of this knot.  On the west edge of the dust patch (1.2' W of the star) is another bright, elongated knot with multiple HII designations including [HK83] 146.


18" (5/14/07): very bright, very large, elongated 4:1 WSW-ENE, ~8'x2'.  This striking galaxy has a very mottled, patchy appearance with the main body appearing twisted or distorted.  A few brighter patches or knots are visible along the major axis with a prominent knot along the west side.  The core region is streaked with dust.  The brightest portions of the two extensions have slightly different orientations or central axes!  The galaxy bulges out a bit on the east end and the galaxy appears to bend a bit towards the north on the west end adding to the asymmetry.  A couple of faint stars are superimposed on the eastern extension and close to the center is a prominent mag 12.5 star masquerading as a bright, stellar nucleus.  The Owl Nebula, M97, lies 48' SE.


17.5" (2/25/84): very bright, very large, edge-on 4:1 WSW-ENE, 8.0'x2.0'.  A mag 12 star is superimposed just west of center (V = 12.5) appearing similar to a bright stellar nucleus.  Two fainter stars are also superimposed east of the core.  A bright knot is visible west of the core (1.3' W of the star) and the region near the core appears dusty.  A mag 12 star is just south of the west end, 4.9' from the center.


17.5" (3/12/88): very bright, very large, a bright star is superimposed near the center, knot visible west of the core.

Pierre Méchain discovered M108 = NGC 3556 = V-46 = h831 on 16 Feb 1781 with a 3-inch refractor.  Messier measured an accurate position and added it by hand to his personal copy of the catalogue, but a later edition was never published.


William Herschel independently discovered the galaxy on 17 Apr 1789 (sweep 922) and recorded H. V-46 as "vB, 10' long and 2' br, resolvable.  An unconnected pB star in the middle."  Herschel was credited with the discovery in the NGC. John Herschel made a single observation on 10 Feb 1831 (sweep 324) and wrote, "B; vL; p b r; vmE; pos 79°.  Has a distinct star in centre and 1 or 2 vS stars elsewhere."  At Birr Castle, M108 was observed  7 times, first on 13 Apr 1850.  It was described in various observations as "twisted", "mottled", "patched and irregular", "knots".

John Herschel discovered NGC 3560 = h834 on 6 Apr 1831 (sweep 340) and recorded "F; R; gbM; 20" (conspicuous).  The PD of the working list [for H III-79] is 6' out, owing to which I have often looked for it in vain."  Although he was correct about the error in the polar distance of H. III-79, JH's polar distance was off by 50'.


Ignoring his previous equivalence with his father's H. III-79 (NGC 3559), JH gave h834 a separate GC designation (2324) at his erroneous position.  Dreyer followed JH, and added the duplicate designation NGC 3560.  Harold Corwin (private correspondence on 10 Aug 1995) identifies NGC 3560 = h834 = H. III 79 = NGC 3559 as JH originally stated.

Ormond Stone discovered NGC 3565 = LM 1-185, along with NGC 3566, in 1886 with the 26" refractor at Leander McCormick Observatory.  Both objects were given the same rough position (nearest min of RA and marked as +/-).  There is nothing near his position.


ESO, RC3 and PGC identify NGC 3565 = NGC 3566 = ESO 570-008, an interacting double galaxy roughly 2.5 min of RA east of Stone's position (typical error in the first discovery list).  On the POSS, the images of these two small galaxies are merged and difficult to resolve.  So, it's possible that Stone observed this galaxy and a nearby faint star for his second object.  RNGC classifies NGC 3565 and 3566 as nonexistent.  Also, see my RNGC Corrections #6 and Harold Corwin's NGC identification notes.

NGC 3576 = ESO 129-005 = RCW 57 = PP 79 = Ced 113a = Statue of Liberty Nebula

11 11 31.7 -61 21 48; Car

Size 1.1'x0.7';  PA = 90°


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 3576 is the first of six sections in a small, but very interesting nebulous complex consisting of NGC 3576, NGC 3579, NGC 3581, NGC 3582, NGC 3584 and NGC 3586 – all situated in the same low power field with NGC 3603!  The entire group is often referred to as the NGC 3576 nebular complex or the RCW 57A region.


NGC 3576 is a somewhat isolated patch on the southwest side, about 5' from the main sections.  At 128x and a UHC filter it appeared as a faint, circular hazy patch of low surface brightness with a mag 12.5 star at the west side and ~1.5' in diameter.  NGC 3579 is a small, fan or wedge-shaped section located just to the west of larger NGC 3584.  It appears 2' in size with a 12th magnitude star at the south tip and spreads to the north and west from this star.  NGC 3581 is the brightest section of this complex and has sharply defined borders running SW-NE and NW-SE, meeting at a right angle about 1' WNW of mag 9.2 SAO 251313. The overall size is ~2'x1.5' with an irregular surface brightness.  It is just disconnected from NGC 3582, which is close NE.  NGC 3582 is another fan-shaped section which wraps around a mag 10.6 star.  It has a well-defined edge running SW to NE with the northern border running E-W. The brighter star is embedded roughly in the center and several mag 13 stars are near the border.  The diameter is ~2' (similar in size to NGC 3581 just SW).  NGC 3584 is the furthest NE and the largest section of nebulosity.  It appears as a looping arc about 3.5'x1', bowed out towards the east and extending mostly N-S and narrowing at the north end.  A few mag 12 stars are off the edges.  NGC 3579 appears as nearly a continuation of this loop towards the west.  Finally, NGC 3586, the last in the complex, is situated ~4' SE of the center of the group of nebulae.  It appears as a faint, elongated steak of 2' length oriented N-S with an 11th magnitude star about 40" NE of the north tip.  The entire group was roughly sketched and easily matched up with the DSS later.  NGC 3603 lies ~25' E.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3576 = h3324 on 16 Mar 1834 and recorded "F, oval.  The first of a group of 6.  Place by collation of diagrams."  His (rough) position is too far southwest.  His sketch was included in the CGH Observations, plate IV, figure 10.


Joseph Turner also sketched this group of nebulae on 19 May 1876 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (plate IV, figure 35 at www.docdb.net/history/texts/1885osngmt________e/lithograph_m_4_35.php).  He sketched it noticeably elongated E-W.

V = 9.8;  Size 202"x196"


48" (4/19/15): at 375x and 488x w/NPB filter; although the unfiltered view was excellent, adding a NPB filter at 488x ramped up the contrast!  The two famous holes were very high contrast with the northwest eye slightly larger with a irregular outline.  The slightly darker southeast eye has an easily visible star at the south edge [40" SSE of the central star].  In addition, a third very faint star (best seen unfiltered) is close west of this hole [37" SSE of center].  Overall the surface brightness of the planetary is irregular or mottled.  It fades around the periphery creating a dimmer ragged circular rim of uneven brightness.  The main bright portion of the planetary is slightly elongated NNW-SSE.


48" (4/15/10): the Owl Nebula was quite impressive at 330x (unfiltered) and exhibited a fascinating amount of detail.  The mag 16 central star was easily visible at the center of the 3.4' disc.  To the northwest and southeast of the central star are two large, darker "holes" (Owl's "eyes"), each roughly 45" in diameter.  The southeast eye has a little more contrast and a very faint star is close to its southeast edge.  The northwest eye is a little larger, though not quite as dark in the center.  A mag 12 star lies 2.6' NE of center and a mag 14 star lies 3' S of center.  MCG +09-19-014, a faint galaxy, lies 3.8' SSE adjacent to a mag 14.5 star.  HCG 50 (faintest of the Hickson Compact Groups) lies 20' ESE.


24" (2/9/13):  although I didn't take notes on the structure of M97, the mag 16 central was readily visible using magnifications of 200x and higher.


17.5" (3/12/88): both holes definitely visible at 280x using a UHC filter.


17.5" (2/28/87): fairly bright, very large, round.  Two low contrast darker "holes" are visible with averted vision which form the "eyes" of the "Owl Nebula".  The southeast hole is darker but the northwest hole appears larger.  Central star not visible.


13.1" (4/29/84): moderately bright, large, round.  A single hole west of center is highly suspected.


13.1" (2/25/84): the darker "holes" visible were near the threshold. No central star seen at 166x-220x.


Pierre Méchain discovered M97 = NGC 3587 = h838 on 16 Feb 1781. In 1789 William Herschel described (with his 18.7") "considerably bright, globular, of equal light throughout, with a diminishing border of no great extent. About 3' diameter."


A total of 45 observations were made at Birr Castle.  The dark holes were first recorded by assistant William Rambaut on 5 Mar 1848: "Saw two dark and very large spots in middle; Lord Rosse remarked that all round its edge the sky appeared darker than the average."  On 11 March, Rosse wrote, "Brilliant star in the centre.  After 5 min observation, detected the star to the right, which Dr. Robinson immediately saw.  Round each star seems a black space." Rosse's or Rambaut's sketch, made in 1848, showed a distinct spiral structure ("a double perforation appears to partake of the structure both of the annular and spiral nebulae.").  He was clearly influenced by the focus on resolving spiral structure in a variety of objects.


Between 1848 and early 1850 Lord Rosse and Johnstone Stoney made additional detailed sketches (one included in the 1850 publication) that vaguely resembled the face of an owl with two large dark holes or "eyes" punctuated by stars (one is the misplaced central star), additional darker streaks and patches, and fuzzy filaments extending out of the sides (perhaps to indicate an irregular fringe).  On 13 Apr 1850, Stoney noted that only one star was visible.  Wilhelm Tempel was highly critical, though, of Rosse's fanciful sketch when he drew the planetary in 1876 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory in Florence.


The nickname "Owl Nebula" was never used by Lord Rosse in a published paper but in 1864 William Darby wrote that M97 was "familiarly known in the Parsontown Observatory as 'the owl nebula' from its resemblance to an owl."  For an unusual interpretation of the appearance, Romney Robinson described the planetary on 11 Mar 1848 as "A most intricate group of spiral arcs disposed around two starry centers, looking like the visage of a monkey."

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this distant (20,000 light years) superluminous HII region and cluster was mesmerizing at 200x using a UHC filter.  The nebulosity was generally elongated E-W, ~5'x3', but with bays and extensions and dark lanes.  The surface brightness was highest to the south of the embedded cluster with a dark lane slashing through the nebulosity just west of the bright core.  At 350x, 15-20 stars were resolved in the glow, though the tiny, brilliant "core" cluster (HD 97950) was only mottled and barely resolved into a few stars.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x a bright irregular nebula surrounds a mag 9 "star".  At 200x, a half-dozen very faint stars are packed very close to the central star.  This very compact knot is actually a distant, very dense, super star cluster (SSC) of extremely luminous stars!  Adding a UHC filter, the nebulosity is irregular at 105x, extending mostly south of the star and fading out into two or three sections that are possibly divided by a dark lane.  The brightest section is to the southwest of the central star.


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this distant but superluminous HII region is a fascinating clump of stars of and nebulosity surrounding a bright 9th magnitude knot.  The bright central region was extremely dense and contained 10-12 stars crammed into 2', yet it seemed only partially resolved at the very center into a couple of stars.  At 128x and UHC filter, the surrounding "haze" is clearly gaseous in nature with the brightest portion offset to the SW side from the core with a roughly broad fan with a total size of approximately 5'x3'.  A dark lane appears to cut through the nebulosity towards the core and there is a strong impression that the field is riddled with dust lanes and patches.  This is a well-studied highly reddened, luminous cluster (~20,000 light years) and HII region with similarities to the Tarantula nebula in the LMC!


John Herschel discovered NGC 3603 = h3334 on 14 Mar 1834 NGC 3603 and recorded "a red star 10m, the centre of an excessively condensed group of stars 15...18m, with a nebulosity extending over 2' diameter.  On the next sweep, he noted "the center, when examined with powers 240 and 320, decidedly not a star, and the nebula about it all resolved.  Perhaps it is a globular clusters, vs vvmbM."


In 1928, Willem van den Bos examined the central "star" with the 26.5-inch refractor at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg and found "the central star to be a close double, B 1184, with many faint stars near."  He measured the AB pair as 0.6" separation in PA 98°, with the "C" component at 1.8" in PA 75° and the D component (I 1132) at 2.7" in PA 259°.  He also noted "The central double is red or at least decidedly reddish, though the spectral type is given as Oe in the Draper Catalogues..."

Otto Struve discovered NGC 3612 on 16 Mar 1869 with the 15-inch Merz refractor at the Pulkovo Observatory while searching for Comet Winnecke (7P/Pons-Winnecke).  His description (translately roughly from German using GoogleTranslate) reads "pretty faint, 30"-40" diameter.  A mag 10-11 star is approximately 2' north following, with the nebula in position angle 225°."  His position is within 1' of UGC 6310, the brighter of a pair with UGC 6321 5.4' east, and his description matches the brighter galaxy (the star is 3' northeast and the PA matches).  Karl Reinmuth identified UGC 6321 as NGC 3612, but noted "No *10-11 nf 2'." and modern sources (including NED) follow this misidentification.


Two nights later (18 Mar) Struve reported finding another nebula,  described as 20" diameter and situated in PA 226° from a 10th magnitude star.  His position was 14 seconds of time too far west, but his PA is a perfect match with UGC 6310.  So, although there are two galaxies here, both of Struve's entries point to the same brighter galaxy.  I notified Corwin and Steinicke of the situation in April 2015 and Wolfgang agreed NGC 3612 = NGC 3615 = UGC 6310.  He mentioned that this leaves UGC 6321 without a NGC designation as Bigourdan, Kobold and Hagen only observed the brighter galaxy.  Kobold called the brighter galaxy NGC 3612, but modern sources identify it as NGC 3609.

Harold Corwin initially identified this number with a star near WH's position but more recently he feels a single or even close double star would not fit Herschel's description of "pL".  So, this object is not found.  See Corwin's notes.

48" (5/9/18): at 488x; this prominent galaxy is extremely large, irregular but elongated at least 2:1 NNW-SSE.  The main disk extends ~7'x3' and is noticeably mottled and dappled with slightly brighter and darker areas.  Around the periphery is a a very low surface brightness outer halo that dissolved into the background sky, but could be traced ~5' SE of center.  The galaxy contains a very large, brighter central region, which appeared somewhat offset within the main disk, though it was less defined than a typical core or nucleus. The most noticeable features are a couple of large dust lanes that border or outline spiral arms and arcs. A long, thin dust lane extends in a SSE to NNW orientation, just east of the central region.  This dark lane cuts off or borders a relatively narrow spiral arm that is adjacent to the east.  It contains a brighter 10" knot (stellar association/HII complex [KWB2013] 104), that was easily visible 1.1' ESE of center and 1.1' due west of mag 12.7 star. A broader dusty lane extends SSE to NNW along the west side.  A very low surface brightness arm running parallel is just west of this darker lane or gap.  The galaxy is outlined by several brighter stars; two mag 10.3/10.6 stars are near the southern edge of the halo, 2.8' SSW of center and 3.9' SSE of center, and a mag 12.7 star is placed ~2.5' ESE of center.  A number of stars cradle the north end of the galaxy; the brightest is a mag 11.6 star [2.6 NW of center], which forms a kite asterism outlining the galaxy, along with the previous three stars.  In additional a couple of stars are superimposed on the north side of the main glow and a number of additional mag 13 and 14 stars are at the northern edge of the halo.


17.5" (4/6/91): bright, large, elongated 5:2 NNW-SSE, 6' diameter, weak central concentration and along the major axis but no sharp nucleus.  Several stars are nearby; three mag 11-13 stars are off the north tip and two mag 10 stars are 2.7' SW and 3.7' SSE of center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3621 = H I-241 = D 617 = h3337 on 17 Feb 1790 (sweep 808) and recorded "cB, vgbM, E from about 70° np to sf, about 6 or 7' long and near 4' broad.  Within a parallelogram of stars."  This is the most southerly object he discovered!  From the latitude of Slough, NGC 3621 culminated at an elevation of only 6.8°!


James Dunlop observed NGC 3621 on 7 May 1826 with his 9-inch reflector from Parramatta, NSZ, and recorded "a very faint pretty large nebula, about 2' broad and 4' long, very faint at the edges. The brightest and most condensed part is near the south following extremity; a small star is involved in the north preceding extremity, and there are two small stars near the south extremity, but not involved."   Dunlop made two observations and his published position is 10' NE of center.


John Herschel observed the galaxy on 29 Apr 1834 from the Cape of Good Hope and recorded, "pB, vL, oval, vgvlbM, resolvable [mottled], 5' long, 3' broad."

48" (5/1/19): at 375x; beautiful, extremely large, showpiece spiral extending 7:2 N-S. The galaxy displayed a strong concentration with a very bright, round core and an intensely bright, prominent nucleus.  There was a slight enhancement along the major axis but no impression of a bar. A long, low contrast dust lane runs N-S along the length of the galaxy on the east side.  The edge was a bit ragged and the glow of the galaxy on its east side had a low surface brightness. A mag 14.5 star is at the W edge of the dust lane, due east of the core.  Also a mag 16 star is at the W edge of the galaxy, slightly south of the nucleus [1.2' WSW of the mag 14.5 star]. A mag 12.3 star is 2.3' SSW of center, just off the W side.

Forms a remarkable trio with M66 20' ESE and NGC 3628 36' NE.  Requires low power (31 Nagler) to easily fit all three in the same field.


13.1" (4/10/86): very bright, elongated N-S, elongated bright core, possible stellar nucleus.


Charles Messier discovered M65 = NGC 3623 = h854, along with M66, on 1 Mar 1780.   William Herschel first observed it on 31 May 1783 with his 12-inch and noted "almost a certainty of its being stars.  There is however in both the nebulas [65 and 66] a certain whitishness left which may be nebulosity."  With his 20-ft scope (18.7-inch), he recorded "a very brilliant nebula extended in the meridian, about 12' long.  It has a bright nucleus, the light of which suddenly diminishes on its border, and two opposite very faint branches."


Lord Rosse first observed M65 on 31 Mar 1848 and called it a "Curious nebula with bright nucleus at left a little above and towards the right is a streak spiral; resolved very well about the nucleus, but no other part.  From the right, and apparently springing from the nucleus, a very faint portion of nebulosity extends for about 15', gradually melting away.  William Rambaut (LdR's assistant) sketch on this night was published in the 1850 PT paper (plate XXXVII, fig. 7).  On 25 Feb 1854, "Lord Rosse suspected dark spaces on either side of the nucleus.", though this suspicion wasn't confirmed the following year.  William Lassell also sketched M65 using the 48" from Malta.

48" (4/13/10): this showpiece galaxy stretches 7'x3' N-S.  The central region is dominated by a prominent, 3'x1.2' central bar that is elongated NNW-SSE.  The central region has a mottled, irregular surface brightness and increases gradually towards the center and then suddenly to a very bright, stellar nucleus.  A very faint star or HII knot was seen at the very north tip of the bar [confirmed as #44 in Hodge's "Second Survey of HII regions in Galaxies", ApJS, 27, 113 (1974)].  The longer, better defined arm is attached at the north end and sweeps directly south along the western flank of the galaxy for a total length of ~5'.  The western edge of this arm is very well defined as it fades to the southern tip, though the inner edge merges with the glow within the central region.  The arm and bar are brightest where they join at the north end of the central region. The second spiral arm is attached at the south end of the bar and shoots north on the eastern side of the galaxy.  This arm fades after a shorter distance, so is not as prominent, but is brightest at the root where it emerges from the bar.  A mag 9.8 star lies 3' NW of center at the outer edge of the halo.


17.5" (1/31/87): very bright, large, elongated N-S, 5'x3', bright elongated core contains a stellar nucleus.  Two spiral arms are visible although the western arm is more prominent.


13.1" (4/24/82): bright elongated core, stellar nucleus.  A diffuse spiral arm extends south and a second short arm extends to the east.  A dark patch is visible just east of the nucleus.


Charles Messier discovered M66 = NGC 3627 = h857 = h875, along with M65, on 1 Mar 1780.  On 12 Apr 1784, William Herschel recorded "vB, mE, iF.  The extension is chiefly in the direction of the meridian, and the greatest brightness near the middle. John Herschel made 4 observations, once claiming it as a new (h875), with his RA 3 minutes too large.  On sweep 22 he logged "vB; vL; sbM; 3' l, 2' br; E 60° np to sf in direction of 2 stars 10m, preceding."


George Stoney sketched the galaxy with Lord Rosse's 72" on 17 Apr 1849 (Plate XXVII, fig. 16 in the 1861 publication).  Features included a well defined spiral arm along the western side and arcs within the main body that correspond with brighter sections of spiral arms.  The 31 Mar 1848 observation by Rosse or assistant Rambaut mentions "a little above towards the right [nf] is a dark streak; spiral, resolved well about the Nucl, but no other part.  From the right, and apparently springing from the nucleus, a vF portion of nebulosity extends for nearly 15', gradually melting away."  A schematic in the 1880 publication shows the beginning of two arms on the eastern side and a long, thick arm on the western side.


William Lassell also sketched M66 using his 48-inch from Malta on 21 Apr 1862, though misidentified it as M65.  The galaxy was drawn as more irregular than spiral, though the primary arm on the west side is clearly sketched, along with a dark gap between it and the core.  Also a loop was sketched on the north side corresponding with part of the eastern arm as well as a continuation of the western arm as it curls towards the core.

48" (5/12/18): at 375x; very prominent, stunning dust lane extending along most of the length of the galaxy [for roughly 8'].  The lane widens on both the WNW and ESE end.  On the ESE end, the outer halo has a fairly low surface brightness and spreads or flares out in width.  At the WNW end, the outer halo was easily visible and sprayed out noticeably in a wide cone, more extensively towards the north, creating an asymmetric appearance.  A mag 16.5 star is along the N edge, at the brightest section, and a mag 15.5 star is 40" further NE.  A brighter mag 14.8 star is along the ESE flank, 2.5' from center.


17.5" (1/31/87): bright, unusually large edge-on WNW-ESE, 11'x2.5'.  A broad irregular dust lane is prominent bisecting the galaxy along the entire length.  Appears brighter to the north of the dark lane and fainter on the south side.


13.1" (4/24/82): the dust lane is clearly visible along the entire length and divides the galaxy into two asymmetric halves with the south slice much fainter.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3628 = H V-8 = h859 on 8 Apr 1784 (sweep 187) and recorded "B, vmE, lbM than towards the ends.  It seems to extend 9 or 10' if not more."  JH called it "a v long narrow ray, vgbM; 15' long, a most curious object.  E by diag in pos 105°.


Lord Rosse first observed NGC 3628 on 31 Mar or 1 Apr 1848.  Samuel Hunter, observing on 10 Feb 1861, noted "split into two parallel rays."  A month later he added "split extends its whole length, the f part being partially filled with faint nebulosity."  Robert Ball, observing on 18 Mar 1866 also noted "there seems to be a dark channel on south side in direction of elongation."

48" (4/4/11): beautiful face-on spiral of 4' diameter with two long, winding arms and branching extensions!  This very bright galaxy appeared sharply concentrated with an intensely bright small core that increased to an extremely bright stellar nucleus.  A prominent patchy arm was attached on the west side of the core and rotated counterclockwise to the north, then bent sharply back in a straight line to the east end of the galaxy. What appeared to be an offshoot arm turned counterclockwise on the east side and continued all the way to the south end of the galaxy.  The second arm was attached on the southeast end of the core and swept around the south side towards the west and then continued to the northwest end of the galaxy.  An offshoot or another patchy arm continued east near the edge of the northern halo.  The two main arms are nearly connected by a slightly brighter region on the south side.  Member of the LGG 241 or UMa NED1 Group.


17.5" (4/1/95): bright, large, round, 3.5' diameter.  Sharp concentration with a prominent core which brightens to a nearly stellar nucleus.  The outer halo fades into the background and shows a hint of the spiral arm structure.  Two mag 12-13 stars are 3.4' NE and 3.3' WNW of center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3631 = I-226 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 920) and recorded "cB, R, small br nucl and vF halo of considerable extent, 3' or 4' dia."


Four observations describing spiral arms were made at Birr Castle.  On 30 Mar 1856, R.J. Mitchell recorded "Spiral, with I think, two arms thus (thumbnail sketch). The arms are broken and of unequal light. There are bright patches at alpha (preceding the nucleus), beta (south preceding arm) and gamma (end of bright north following arm)."  A week later he logged "Spirality seen as in last observation. The following branch comes down past the other, doubling over it and seems to originate from the preceeding side of nucleus. Very patchy."


The1880 publication has a thumbnail sketch and the 1861 publication has a drawing (Plate XXVII, fig 20).  Both show the main features that can be confirmed on the DSS.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3632 = H II-30 on 15 Feb 1784 (sweep 146) and described a "pB neb, it seems to contain stars; it is of some extent."  There is nothing at his position (objects found in his early sweeps often have fairly large offset errors), but 24 sec of RA west and 12' N is NGC 3626.  Dreyer, in his 1912 revision of WH's catalogues, states "not seen by d'A (5 times), is no doubt =II 52 = NGC 3626 only 24s p and 12' N.  The latter was observed 14 Mar 1784, a neb like II 51 but a little longish."  This conclusion is repeated by Karl Reinmuth in his photographic survey.  So, NGC 3632 = NGC 3626.

See observing notes for NGC 3630.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3645 = H II-32 = h867 on 23 Feb 1784 (sweep 158) and recorded "pB, vS, bM so that it resembles an irregular nebulous star."  His position, reduced correctly by Caroline, falls 3' south of NGC 3643 (much too faint to fit his description), in a group of very faint galaxies.  But it is also 70 seconds of RA due east of NGC 3630, a bright galaxy that fits the description.  John Herschel has a single observation, giving a very rough position (near his father's) but the description "pB; S; E; bM", also implies h867 = NGC 3630.  In fact, JH suggested the equivalence in the GC, though Dreyer rejected this in the NGC Notes section because Tempel claimed an observation of NGC 3645 (h867).


The identification of H. II-32 was analyzed by Malcolm Thomson in the Webb Society Quarterly Journal #73, Alister Ling in issue #87 and Harold Corwin in his NGC/IC identification notes. They all concluded that NGC 3645 is likely a duplicate observation of NGC 3630.  RNGC and CGCG misidentify CGCG 039-143 as NGC 3645.

48" (5/16/12 and 4/6/13): this showpiece spiral appeared bright, large, oval ~2:1 SW-NE, sharply concentrated with a very bright core.  The visual treat was a prominent lens or eye-shaped ring surrounding the core!  The ring was slightly brighter in an arc along the north side.  At the west edge of this arc was a very faint quasi-stellar knot (SDSS J112141.34+201039.0, V = 17.2).  Another section of the ring that stands out is along the southwest edge, with a brighter linear piece about 40" long that has several SDSS designations.  The interior of the ring is fairly dark near this section, as well as other sections, providing a good contrast between the core and ring.  A very small, weak brightening was also noted on the northeast end of the ring.  A mag 14 star lies 1.4' NW of center and a mag 16 star is 1' SSE of center.


17.5" (4/14/01): moderately bright, fairly large, elongated 3'x2' SW-NE.  Gradually increases to a brighter 30" oval core.  A quasi-stellar nucleus is occasionally visible with direct vision.  Forms a pair with NGC 3649 7.8' ENE.


13.1": moderately bright and large, elongated, broad concentration with no nucleus.  An extremely faint star or knot is involved.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3646 = H III-15 = h866 on 15 Feb 1784 (sweep 146) and recorded "Two, a Large nebula [NGC 3646] followed by a small one [NGC 3649], in the same field of view with it.  The large one is extremely and small one still fainter, so that I did not perceive it immediately.  I suppose the large one cannot be less than 5 or 6' of extent."  JH logged "F; L; E; 2' long.  The sp of two [with NGC 3649]."


Bindon Stoney, observing with LdR's 72" on 13 Apr 1852, remarked "L neb [NGC 3646] is bM.  It has a knot in sp end and a dark curved passage on p and n sides of centre; Spiral."  This description is similar to the view in Jimi Lowrey's 48".

Albert Marth discovered NGC 3647 = m 223 on 22 Mar 1865 and noted an "eF neb. star."  His position falls in a tight quartet including CGCG 039-135, -140, -141 and -142.  Bigourdan misidentified a star as NGC 3647.


Various modern sources pick all four of these compact galaxies as NGC 3647!  NED, HyperLeda and NGC/IC Project (Corwin) identifies CGCG 039-141 as NGC 3647, CGCG identifies CGCG 039-142 as NGC 3647, and the RNGC position falls on CGCG 039-140.  But CGCG 039-135 is the brightest visually in the quartet!  So, although the identification is uncertain with 4 close candidates, the 2014 version of Harold Corwin's NGC positions file also identifies CGCG 039-135 as NGC 3647.

48" (4/21/17): at 697x and 813x; this multi-armed barred spiral appeared bright, large, oval 4:3 WNW-ESE, ~2.8'x2.1'.  The core consists of fairly narrow bar oriented NNW-SSE with a bright quasi-stellar nucleus at the center.

17.5" (5/4/02): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 4:3 ~SSW-NNE, 1.0'x0.7'.  There is a fairly bright star ~mag 13.5 which is superimposed about 10" NE from the geometric center and appears similar to a bright stellar nucleus.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3662 = H IV-4 = h879 on 22 Feb 1784 (sweep 153) and recorded "an excessively faint nebula, consisting of a nucleus with a vF, S, brush sp.  The brush is not regularly fan shapes."   Herschel commented in his 1814 PT paper that "a very small star has an extremely faint and very small nebula attached to it in the shape of a puff.".  He gave this example as evidence of a union of attraction between the nebula and the star.  JH called this object a "star 13-14 m with a F, S, nebulous brush."


Wolfgang Steinicke, in "Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters" states Julius Schmidt found NGC 3662 on 29 Mar 1862 with a 15.7-cm refractor and described an "exceedingly faint, object with slight central condensation." There was a controversy involving a number of observers whether this was a "variable nebula" (like NGC 1555) as either this galaxy or a nearby star appeared in the BD catalogue (BD -1° 2436) and marked as a nebula.  Involved in the controversy were Julius Schmidt, d'Arrest, Hermann Goldschmidt, C.H.F. Peters and Argelander.  The end result is that Argelander found a mistake occurred in the BD entry and the star should not have been marked as nebulous.

Andrew Ainslie Common discovered NGC 3663 in 1880 with his 36" silvered-glass reflector and recorded "eF, fan-shaped, star close".  There is nothing at his position but 15' north is MCG -02-29-023 = PGC 35006 and two stars are at the northeast side of this galaxy.  Common's position for his 32 discoveries are consistently poor in declination (obtained from reading the setting circle), so this identification is very plausible.

48" (5/12/12): This disrupted spiral was a fascinating sight in Jimi Lowrey's 48-inch. The brightest feature is a very knotty 1' irregular bar oriented SW-NE, containing at least three brighter knots. The brightest knot is at the northeast end with at least two very close knots on the southwest side. A very short offshoot extends just north of the northeast end.  Fainter haze surrounds the bar on the NW and SE sides.


The second brightest feature is a detached, mottled "arm segment" on the southwest side that's oddly cocked (NW-SE) perpendicular to the bar. As it appeared detached from the bar, it didn't seem like it was part of a spiral feature.  But this arm segment dims significantly and continues curving clockwise around the south and east side, making a low surface brightness outer loop or ring, reaching around to the other side of the bar!  Then I realized the bar was noticeably offset towards the northwest side within a rounder 1.6' outline.


NGC 3664A, situated 6.2' south, is a much fainter disturbed companion that was likely involved in a train wreck with NGC 3664 during an earlier encounter.  NGC 3664 is a 30" fairly low surface brightness glow with a broad concentration, but it didn't reveal any irregular structure. UGC 6417, a more challenging edge on, is another 5' further south.


17.5" (5/4/02): fairly large, low surface brightness glow with just a weak concentration, ~2' diameter.  Nearly collinear with a wide pair of mag 10.5/12.5 stars 3' SE with a mag 10.5 star 7' NW also on this line.  In addition, three mag 13 stars to the east are collinear!  Located 20' W of a mag 6.7 star. This Arp galaxy has an unusual extension that juts at a 90° angle from the main body.


13.1" (4/10/86): very faint, slightly elongated ~N-S.  Two stars lie SE and a bright star (82 Leo) is ~20' E.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 3664 on 14 Mar 1879 with the 11-inch refractor at the Arcetri Observatory in Italy. He called it a double nebula with the two nuclei separated by 15"-20", so he resolved the two brightest "knots" along the central bar.  The discovery was reported in a short note in AN 94, p. 335.

This neb must have changed greatly if it ever belonged really to the 1st class [as place by WH]."


Winnecke wrote a paper in 1879 (AN 2293) claiming this nebula displayed "periodic variability".  As "proof" Winnecke mentions William Herschel placed this nebula in his first class of "Bright Nebula", but John Herschel called it "eF, 2nd or 3rd class."  Winnecke described it as "pretty bright", while d'Arrest in 1863 termed it "subobscura".  Dreyer found it barely visible in 1887 with the 10-inch Grubb refractor at Armagh but in 1891 he it appeared bright.


Dreyer was critical of reports of variability of nebulae in general and commented in a 1891 paper that "this is a diffused nebula with a very slight central condensation" and "the appearance of objects of this kind is far more influenced by the state of our atmosphere than that of nebulae with a distinct condensation."  Wolfgang Steinicke discusses this cases on page 519 of his book on the history of the NGC.

Frank Muller discovered NGC 3676 = LM 2-436 in 1886 with the 26" refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory.  There is nothing at his position, but 30' south is MCG -02-29-029 = PGC 35131 and his comment "2 st 10 nf, sf" matches this galaxy perfectly.  NGC 3676 was not recovered by Bigourdan because of the poor discovery position.


RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent and MCG -02-29-029 is not labeled as NGC 3676 in the MCG, Deep Sky Field Guide, Megastar, etc.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3679 = H III-112 on 24 Apr 1784 (sweep 205) and recorded "cL, eF, R, r.  Just preceding, and very near a B star.  The nebulosity touches the star.  There is so much moonlight that I do not see it satifactory, and am, even not without some doubts as to the reality, but must defer the verification till a darker night."  There is nothing near his position.


Dreyer notes that WH could not find this nebula again on 29 Dec 1786 (sweep 673).  He reported "Looked for the Nebula III. 112 and though the night is apparently not a bad one, I could not find it.  I examined a great part of the heavens in this neighborhood but saw nothing of it."  He searched again unsuccessfully on 20 Mar 1789 (sweep 912), but found another nebula - probably MCG -01-29-021 - "making a trapezium with 2 small stars".  The RNGC and PGC (as well as secondary sources such as Megastar) identify this galaxy as NGC 3679.   But there is no bright star near MCG -01-29-021 matching the original description and Dreyer concludes that III-112 is probably nonexistent.  NGC 3915 = H III-113, the next object found in the sweep, also cannot be identified with any confidence.


See Harold Corwin's discussion of these identities.  He suggests that NGC 3679 might be MCG -01-29-012, located 2.4' south of of mag 7.8 HD 98750.  My visual description refers to (R)NGC 3679.  Interestingly, Spitaler also identified this galaxy as NGC 3679 in an 1892 observation and measured an accurate position.

John Herschel found NGC 3684 = h893 on 17 Mar 1831 and logged "cB; L; E; vgbM; 100" diameter."  JH made a total of three observations and d'Arrest measured the position on 5 nights.  JH is credited with the discovery in the GC and NGC.


But Wolfgang Steinicke found that WH probably discovered this galaxy on 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 198).  After discovering NGC 3681, he turned north and found another new object, II-160, which he described as "cL, R, brightest in the middle but the brightness goes off very gradually."

He describes this as "the higher surface brightness component of a pair of CGCG galaxies; the other is UGC 06466, a pretty low surface brightness barred spiral."  I confirmed Todd's offsets for the nearby stars, so this identification is certain.  The RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent, though NED and HyperLeda use this identification.

His observation of II-160 a month later on 17 Apr 1784 was assumed by JH and Dreyer to be a duplicate observation, but Wolfgang Steinicke analyzed the sweep and found II-160 applies to NGC 3684 instead.


JH observed h894 on 3 sweeps recording "pB; pL. (N.B. II 160 and III 28 are probably identical".  On a second sweep he noted "B; L; R; bM; has a L star north and a smaller one south".  Finally he logged "B; vL; E; vgbM; 2' diam.  Near a *."  Dreyer followed JH's comment in his first sweep and commented in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that the transit for II 160 must have been recorded 1 tmin too late.

48" (5/12/12): at 488x, the southwest component (VV 118b) of NGC 3690 appeared as a very bright, elongated, irregular knot of high surface brightness.  Contains a very bright, quasi-stellar nucleus.  The northeast component (VV 118a) is the larger of the merged interacting pair and appeared bright, moderately large, ~1' diameter, small very bright core.  A very low surface, asymmetric halo extends on the northwest side of the bright pair.  The southwest component is generally misidentified as IC 694, which is described below.


VV 118d/e, probably HII regions, are just 45" NW of NGC 3690 (just outside the halo).  Occasionally an extremely faint and small glow popped in this position, 6"-8" diameter.  IC 694, ~1' NW of the bright pair, was easily visible as a fairly faint, slightly elongated glow, 15"x12", weak concentration.  PGC 35345 (the brighter component of Arp 296) lies 2.6' NE.  It was also a direct vision, fairly faint glow, fairly small, oval 4:3 NW-SE, 24"x18", increasing to a very small brighter core.


17.5" (4/1/95): NGC 3690 is a disrupted, interacting double system (Arp 299).  This unusual pair appears moderately bright, fairly small, elongated E-W.  The appearance is confusing with two very small "knots" in a common halo elongated E-W (20" between centers).  On the west side is a fairly bright virtually stellar "knot", which is probably the nucleus of the brighter member of NGC 3690.  There is a small fainter unconcentrated extension on the following end and the two components are not individually resolved.  With averted vision, IC 694 was barely glimpsed as an extremely faint spot about 1' NW.


17.5" (3/19/88): fairly bright, moderately large, elongated ~E-W, irregular, mottled appearance.  A mag 14 star is superimposed on the west side and an extremely faint mag 15.5 star or knot is involved.  This is a disrupted interacting system which includes IC 694.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3690 = H I-247 = h896 on 18 Mar 1790 (sweep 951) and recorded "pB, lE, mbM."  On 9 Apr 1793 (sweep 1039) he logged "vB, pL, lE near the parallel, but a little from nf to sp."  JH reported "B; R; pgbM.  Query whether there be not a * excentric towards the south-following side." The "star" may refer to the companion on the south side.  On 27 Jan 1852, LdR's assistant Bindon Stoney described the system as "Neb div into two parts, faint appendage np about one dia distant."


Swift also noticed it was double in 1883, writing in Sidereal Messenger IV (p39), "mentioned to all observers as very little elongated.  Chancing to run across it with a power of 132, I immediately suspected it to be a close double, which suspicion a power of 200 confirmed.  It is probably the closest double nebula known."  Swift reobserved the galaxy on 18 Apr 1892 (list X) and noted "vs, close D with [NGC] 3690, suspected with 132, ver with 200".  This is nearly identical to his 1883 comments.  Dreyer entered Stoney's and Swift's second component as IC 694 -- but did they apply to the same object?


Usually, IC 694 is identified as the southwest component of the interacting double system NGC 3690 and this is likely what Swift resolved in his first observation.  But Stoney's earlier observation clearly resolved NGC 3690 into two components as well as picking up the extremely faint 16th mag galaxy (MCG +10-17-002a = VV 118c) "one diameter" NW of the NGC 3690 system.  Based on Stoney's observation, it is reasonable to assign IC 694 or IC 694B to MCG +10-17-002a = VV 118c.

Sir Robert Ball, an assistant on the Lord Rosse's 72" telescope, discovered NGC 3695 on 31 Mar 1867 in his observation of NGC 3694.  He described "3 faint nebula forming a triangle certainly seen here and one or more susp in the neighborhood.  There being no great difference in brightness, it is not easy to see which is h899 [NGC 3694].  The 2 nf ones, pos 310°, dist 339" [5564 and 5566]."  The relative position for the latter two exactly match NGC 3695 = GC 5564 = UGC 6490 and NGC 3700 = GC 5566 = UGC 6494.


But on 18 Mar 1876 Dreyer reobserved NGC 3694 and stated "nnp is a pS, eeF neb [=5564] in PA 357.2°, Dist 256.7"."  This was the position Dreyer used in NGC for NGC 3695 and it corresponds with mag 14.8 star at 11 28 53.1 +35 29 00 (2000).  In the same observation, Dreyer notes "about 15' n and a few minutes f is another eF, vS neb [5565] with an ef* 2' sf."  Apparently he felt this object was not observed on 31 Mar 1867 so he assigned it separate designations GCS 5565 = NGC 3698, but his rough description applies to UGC 6490 = NGC 3695, which has a mag 14.4 star 1.7' southeast.  So, most likely NGC 3698 is a duplicate observation of NGC 3695.

This description appears to match NGC 3695 = UGC 6490, which was discovered 9 years earlier by Sir Robert Ball on 31 Mar 1867 (see notes on N3695).

V = 11.0;  Size 71"


24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this showpiece planetary appeared very bright, fairly large, ~70" in diameter.  It displayed an excellent contrast response using an UHC filter at 200x.  The planetary is bisected by a prominent, broad dark rift that slashes through the planetary from WSW to ENE (like Centaurus A!).  The northern lobe is the more prominent: both larger and brighter.  The shape of this lobe is semicircular with a round, outer periphery but with a fairly straight edge SW-NE in the interior due to the dark rift.  The center of the dust lane is south of the geometric center of the planetary, giving an asymmetric distribution to the lobes.  The rift itself is widest at the ENE end and tapers down towards the WSW end.  Superb view at 350x as the extra magnification increases the contrast and confirms that the south lobe is fully detached by the dust lane at the WSW end.  The compact planetary He 2-67 lies in the same field 11' SE.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 100x, this planetary appeared moderately bright and large, ~60"-65" in size.  There was a good contrast gain with a UHC filter at 105x and 166x and it appeared brightest on the north side of the planetary.  A dark rift running WSW-ENE appears to nearly detach the smaller and fainter southern section.


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this interesting planetary is moderately bright, fairly large, ~70" in diameter with some faint stars superimposed.  With the UHC filter the appearance is very unusual with a dark rift bisecting it in a WSW-ENE orientation just below the geometric center.  At 228x, the northern "hemisphere" is both larger and brighter with an irregular surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is ~1' NW.  This is a fascinating planetary set in a beautiful Centaurus star field with an appearance similar to faint HII region or a small version of Cen A!


John Herschel discovered NGC 3699 = h3345 on 1 Apr 1834 and recorded "B; pL; irr R; pgpmbM; 90"; r.  Almost resolved. It is, however, by no means a mere knot of the Milky Way."  Joseph Turner sketched this planetary on 8 Apr 1878 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope.  It accurately showed two segments cut by a "dark channel on the following side".  The dark lane is oriented NE-SW with the cut off section to the east much smaller and the dark lane slightly wider at the NE end.  Robert Innes observed it with the 9-inch refractor at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg in 1914 and called it "a faint nearly round nebula 60" in diameter, mag = 14th."

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 3704 = T I-35 = T V-10 on 23 Feb 1878 with the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory and recorded "Class III; a star 15m (nebulous?) follows 2 sec; near the comparison star is another fainter nebula [NGC 3707]."  His micrometric position matches MCG -02-29-037 = PGC 35435, the brighter of the pair.


Andrew Ainslie Common independently discovered this galaxy in 1880 with his 36" silvered-glass reflector and described "2 [along with NGC 3707], F, R, on the parallel, star symmetrically placed between."  Common's single position is 13' north of MCG -02-29-037 but his description is a perfect match with the pair.  The NGC description for NGC 3704 mentions a mag 9-10 star 2' SSE of NGC 3704, although the bright star is actually 2.6' WNW.  The RNGC and MCG position is 2' too far north.

JH made two observations, but his PD differed by 5' and his descriptions were sufficiently different he assumed h902 and h903 were perhaps different objects.

Andrew Common made an independent discovery in 1880 with his 36" silvered-glass reflector (along with NGC 3704) and described "2, F, R, on the parallel, star symmetrically placed between."  Common's single position (obtained roughly using his setting circles)  is 13' north of the pair MCG -02-29-037 = NGC 3704 and PGC 35446 = NGC 3707.  His description applies, though, as there is a mag 15 star between the two galaxies.  Dreyer credits both Tempel and Common with the discovery in the NGC.  Howe could only find NGC 3704 on 4 nights of searching with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.


The NGC summary descriptions (from Tempel?) for both NGC 3704 and NGC 3707 has errors.  The description for NGC 3707 mentions a "*15 (neb?) 2s following", which actually describes the mag 15 star 2.8 tsec following NGC 3704.  See RNGC Corrections #4.


For some reason, the RNGC ignores the second fainter galaxy of the pair and lists NGC 3707 as nonexistent.

It extended perhaps 0.4'x0.2' in the direction of a couple of stars with a third star nearby making a triple.  Located ~8' NE of mag 6.7 HD 100041.


More likely NGC 3712 is a duplicate observation of NGC 3714.  See observing notes for that number.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3712 = h905 on 26 Mar 1827 and recorded "vF; R; smbM."  The following month he noted "F; vS; R; bM."  Neither description is helpful in identifying this number and his one good position (first observation) falls on a blank patch of sky, roughly 8' from both NGC 3714 and UGC 6506.  Bigourdan and Reinmuth were unsuccessful in finding h905.  RNGC and RC3 identify UGC 6506 as NGC 3712, but UGC, MCG and CGCG do not label this galaxy as NGC 3712.


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 3712 is more likely a duplicate observation of NGC 3714 as he observed these objects on different sweeps and his position for NGC 3712 was far enough off that he assumed it was new.  See his identification notes for more.

48" (4/21/17): at 488x; very bright, large, nearly edge-on ~5:1 SSW-NNE, slightly bulges at the center.  Contains a large, very bright central section with a mag 12.5 star attached near the NNE end.  A sharp dust lane cuts off part of the central section along the northwest flank, partially hiding the core.  Only a very faint, thin strip of the galaxy on the northwest side of the dust lane was occasionally visible.  With averted vision the low surface brightness outer extensions (beyond the mag 12.5 star) were visible out to roughly 3.5' diameter. Forms a pair with IC 2913 7.4' SE. The companion appeared fairly bright, round, 0.6' diameter, moderate even surface brightness but with no obvious core/nucleus.


18" (3/19/04): moderately bright, moderately large, very elongated SSW-NNE, 2.5'x0.5', small brighter core, fades at the ends of the thin extensions.  A mag 13 star is attached near the NNE end and this galaxy appears like a dagger attached to the brighter star.  Located 7' ESE of mag 9 SAO 179951.  Photographs reveal a strong dust lane but this was not noticed visually.


8" (5/21/82): faint, small, very elongated ~N-S, thin, moderately large.  Located 10' SE of mag 8.5 SAO 179951 and 1° SSW of north Crateris (V = 5.8).  Forms a pair with IC 2913 7.3' SE (not seen).


John Herschel discovered NGC 3717 = h3348 on 29 Apr 1834 and recorded "pB; S; mE; attached to a star."   His position matches ESO 439-015.  He made a second observation the next sweep, though his position was 7' too far north.

48" (4/4/11): NGC 3718 is a very striking, distorted system with sweeping arms emanating from an oval main body crossed by a curving dust lane (reminiscent of Centaurus A).  At 375x it appeared very bright, very large, elongated ~5:2 N-S (including arms), ~6.5'x2.5', contains a bright round core.  A star is at the east edge of the core.  The main body is nearly split by a dust lane or gap oriented NW to SE, which is particularly evident on the NW side as a lane.  A spiral arm (perhaps 0.4' wide) is attached at the NW end and gently curves counterclockwise towards the NE.  The surface brightness is fairly low and the arm or wing dims as it extends nearly to the west of a mag 11 star located 4' NNE of center. The dust on the south side of the core covers a larger region and is concentrated just west of where the southern arm begins to emerge on the southeast end.  A fairly low surface brightness arm spreads south (wider than the northern arm), passing east of a wide mag 11 pair at 33" separation.  The overall visual impression is that the "arms" are really tidal tails being drawn out from a past interaction as the central body looks more like the merger of two galaxies resulting in the warped dust lane and "S" shaped body.  All five members of HCG 56 (located 7' S) were easily resolved.


13.1" (3/24/84): fairly bright, fairly large, broad concentration, almost round.  Double star h2574 = mag 11/11 at 35" separation is 2.2' SSW of center.  NGC 3729 lies 12' ENE.    Member of the LGG 241 or UMa NED1 group, probably a subgroup of the NGC 3992 (M109) group. The galaxy chain HCG 56 = UGC 6527 = VV 150 lies 7' S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3718 = H I-221 = h908 on 12 Apr 1789 (sweep 919) and recorded "pB or cB, R, vgmbM, about 3' dia."  His position is accurate.


Bindon Stoney, observing on 27 Jan 1852 with LdR's 72", commented "found a neb strongly mottled, with stars inv."  A later observation in 1868 questioned if it was a double nebula.

24" (3/9/13): fairly faint, small, oval 5:3 NW-SE, 24"x15", lens-shaped.  Two mag 15/15.5 stars lie 2' SE.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 3721 is uncertain.  Member of a large group (USGC S171) at z = .021 with brightest members NGC 3730 and 3771.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3721= LM 2-441 in 1886 and simply recorded "mag 15.5, 0.1' dia, R, gbM."  There is nothing at his position but Harold Corwin lists PGC 35727 as a possible candidate at 11 34 07.8 -09 28 01 (2000).  This galaxy is 1.5 tmin of RA east of Leavenworth's position (typical error) but matches in declination.  Corwin lists PGC 170156 as a preferable candidate at 11 31 53.4 -09 31 57.  This galaxy is 0.7 min of time west of Leavenworth's position but is 4.5' south (a less common error).  Finally, RNGC identifies MCG -01-30-003 as NGC 3721.  Although brighter than the other candidates, it is 1.7 min of RA east and 7' south of Leavenworth's position.  All in all, there is no compelling candidate to me.  See Corwin's identification notes for more.

Brightest of four in a 4' string, including extremely faint MCG -01-30-006 = PGC 35753 just 0.7' NNE.  PGC 35753 appeared extremely faint to very faint, round, just 6" diameter!  Member of a large group (USGC S171) at z = .021.

Also nearby is MCG -01-30-003 (possibly NGC 3730) 6.4' NNW and a two anonymous galaxies 9' and 10' NNE.  Located 10' NNE of NGC 3732.  The galaxies in this group have uncertain NGC designations due to poor positions by Leavenworth.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3722 = LM 2-442, along with NGC 3724, in 1886 and noted "mag 15.0, round, 0.2', sbMN, 1st of 2 [with N3724]."  There is nothing at his position, but this number is generally equated with MCG -01-30-005, which lies 1.8 min of RA east (good match in dec).  The error in RA is fairly common in the LM discoveries, though there is no galaxy southeast to match NGC 3724 (a companion is northeast).


Corwin proposes PGC 170153 as NGC 3722.  This galaxy is a closer match  in RA (less than 1 min of RA west) and agrees in declination.  Also, NGC 3734 would match IC 2910 in relative offset.  See NGC 3734.

Andrew Common discovered NGC 3723 in 1880 with his 36-inch reflector.  His position is just 8 sec of RA following and 1.5' north of MCG -02-30-002 (relatively accurate compared to his generally poor positons).

Middle galaxy in a 4' string with NGC 3722 1.8' SW and MCG -01-30-008 = PGC 35771 2.4' ENE.  Both of these companions are comparable in brightness. Also much fainter MCG -01-30-006 is 1.1' SW.  PGC 35771 (labeled as NGC 3730 in the RNGC) appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 WSW-ENE, 0.4'x0.15'.  Member of a large group (USGC S171) at z = .021.

The NGC identifications in the group (from Leavenworth) are uncertain due to poor positions and several nearby faint galaxies.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3724 = LM 2-443 in 1886 and noted "mag 15.0, 0.4' dia, R, sbMN, 2nd of of 2 [with NGC 3722]."  There is nothing at his exact position, though a number of candidates are in the area.  MCG -01-30-007 = PGC 35757 is often taken (RNGC, PGC, NED, HyperLeda) as NGC 3724 and MCG -01-30-005 = PGC 35746 is taken as NGC 3722.  The MCG does not label MCG -01-30-007 as NGC 3724.  This pair is between ~1.7 min of RA east of Leavenworth's positions (not an uncommon error) though the relative orientation (southwest-northeast) is wrong.   Corwin proposes the identification NGC 3722 = PGC 170153 and NGC 3724 = IC 2910.  These two galaxies are less than 1 min of RA west of Leavenworth's position and match the correct orientation.


MCG -01-30-007 was possibly discovered by Andrew Common 6 years earlier with his 36-inch reflector.  In his description for NGC 3732 (#20), he mentions "a cluster of 3 similar ones 15' N", which appears to refer to MCG -01-30-005, -007 and -008, though Dreyer did not assign NGC designations to Common's trio.

Mitchell on 30 Mar 1856 wrote, "it appears of the shape annexed [sketch shows a dramatic "S" shaped (barred) spiral], which exaggerates.  There can be no doubt of the bend upwards at Alpha [shows the southeast arm] and of the darkness about the nucleus."  NGC 3726 was included in the list of spiral nebulae in the 1850 PT paper.

Several fainter galaxies in field including the trio of NGC 3722, NGC 3724 and MCG -01-30-008 ~6' SE and a very faint pair of anonymous galaxies 4.5' NE and 7.0' NE.  The NGC identification is very uncertain as Leavenworth's position is a very poor match.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3730 = LM 2-445 in 1886 and logged "mag 15.6, 0.5' dia, lE 140°, glbM."   There is nothing at this position, though a number of galaxies to the east are possibilities.  In addition, Andrew Common, in his observation of NGC 3732, noted "a cluster of 3 similar ones 15' n."  Dreyer assumed one of these was Leavenworth's NGC 3730 (mentioned in the NGC notes section).


The brightest and largest of the galaxies to the north of NGC 3732 is MCG -01-30-003 = PGC 35734, though this is not necessarily one of Common's "cluster of 3".  This galaxy is 0.9 min of RA east of Leavenworth's position and 2' north.  The RNGC likely misidentifies MCG -01-30-008 as NGC 3730.  Another possibility is NGC 3730 refers to one of the trio of extremely faint galaxies that are situated ~6' northeast of MCG -01-03-003, though none would likely be described as large as 0.5' diameter.  So, MCG -01-30-003 is the most plausible candidate.

Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 3753, while an assistant at Birr Castle, on 9 Feb 1874 and noted "pF, star in PA 5.5°, Dist 71.7"."  This galaxy was labeled Eta in the constructed sketch of 13 Apr 1876.  Copeland found this group while searching in vain for d'Arrest's GC 2464 = NGC 3760, which he assumed was in the general location.  But d'Arrest had made a 1-hour error in RA, so his object was not to be found and the Septet happened to be just west of d'Arrest's erroneous position.


Due to a mixup in the reference star, though, Dreyer's computed positions for Copeland's Septet were offset 1.5 min of RA too far west and 16' too far south.  The error was caught by Hermann Kobold while observing with the 19-inch Merz refractor at the Strasbourg Observatory in 1894 (see AN 3241).  Dreyer acknowledged the correction in AN 3246 and the correction was given in the IC 1 Notes section.  Still, the RNGC did not catch the correction and listed the entire Septet as nonexistent!  See RNGC Corrections #2 and Deep Sky 1983.  The nickname "Copeland Septet" appears in the RC2 notes section.

NGC 3758 is a post-merger pair and the twin nuclei (separated by ~11,000 light-years) both house super-massive black holes!  The seeing was fairly poor at the time of the observation but the twin nuclei were still easily resolved.  Located 2.6' ESE of a bright mag 9.7 star (SAO 81899).

Also in the field is a 43" pair of mag 9.5 stars ~8' SSE.  Copeland discovered NGC 3758 and this galaxy is situated 30' SW of Copeland's Septet.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 3758 south of "Copeland's Septet on 18 Mar 1874 and logged "pB; S; R; smbM; Nucl not stellar."  His offsets to nearby stars is a perfect match with CGCG 126-110 = PGC 35905, although it was placed too close to Copeland's Septet on the constructed sketch of 13 Apr 1876 showing all discovered nebulae.  This galaxy was independently found by Stephan exactly 10 years later on 18 Mar 1884 and accurately placed in his list XIII-61.


Bill Keel dubbed this the "Owl" galaxy (because of twin nuclei) in a 1993 article in Mercury magazine article "The real astrophysical zoo - Colliding galaxies", though there are no Google hits on that nickname.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3760 on 21 Feb 1863 and recorded "B, pS, mbMN = *13, a mag 11 star precedes 4 seconds of time and south 175"."  There is nothing at his position and he searched in vain for it again in Jan 1865.  Dreyer mentions in the NGC notes that nothing was found at Birr Castle, though "a large group of novae preceding it [Copeland's Septet!] was found."


In the IC 1 notes, Dreyer comments "Delenda.  It is = [NGC] 3301 with an error of 1 hour in RA [too large]."  This identity was first suggest by Kobold in 1894.  d'Arrest also mistakenly placed the nearby mag 11 star to the south, instead of north (same offset) and also made the same 1 hour transcription error the same night with NGC 3375, which is identical to NGC 3162.

It contains a very dense mass of stars in the central 5' that are seemingly arranged in a spiral configuration as well as a beautiful string of stars running SW-NE on the south side of the cluster.  A mag 7.2 M-type reddish star (SAO 251470) lies at the NW end, a mag 7.5 star is on the east side (HD 306799) and a mag 7.1 star (HD 100943) is on the SE side.  On the N end is B798, a mag 9.1/9.4 pair at 5" separation. This impressive cluster was a surprising showpiece as it wasn't on my radar as an excellent cluster.  Located 50' NW of a mag 5.1 star and 1.4° due north of mag 3.1 Lambda Centauri.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): easy naked-eye cluster in a gorgeous wide-angle binocular field!  Situated within a superb string of bright stars.  Very bright, high surface brightness cluster with a few resolved stars, moderately large and well defined. A few additional stars popped on and off.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 3766 = Lac III-7 = D 289 = h3352 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted "three faint stars in nebulosity".  James Dunlop observed the cluster on 27 Apr 1826 (first night logging objects) and noted, "A pretty large cluster of stars of mixt magnitudes, about 10' diameter. The greater number of the stars are of a pale white colour. There is a red star near the preceding side; another of the same size and colour near the following side; another small red star near the centre; and a yellow star near the south following extremity, all in the cluster."  Dunlop's position was about 10' too far SE.


John Herschel first observed the cluster on 14 Mar 1834 and noted "the preceding of two chief stars of a fine, large, loose, round cluster of stars 8..12th mag; gradually pretty much brighter in the middle, fills field; 150..200 stars." Two sweeps later he recorded, "A very fine cluster class VII; nearly round, 8' diameter, slightly compressed in the middle, stars of 9..15th magnitude; place that of an orange star 9..10th mag following the centre."

Andrew Common discovered NGC 3779 in 1860 with his 36" reflector.  With respect to NGC 3775, he noted "another 5' nf ".  Close to this offset is MCG -02-30-013 = PGC 36084.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position, that was repeated in the IC 2 notes.


Frank Muller found IC 717 on 14 Feb 1888 with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and described it as "1.0'x0.8', E 90°, dif."  With respect to NGC 3775, he measured an offset of +53.92 seconds in RA but no delta for declination.  Apparently he made a 30 second error as NGC 3779 follows by +24 seconds in RA.  His description "E 90° [E-W]" seems to clinch the identification IC 717 = NGC 3779.

48" (4/2/11): the brightest of 6 galaxies in a 15' group that is stretched out in a SW to NE orientation.  At 375x appeared very bright, very large, elongated 3:2 WNW-ESE, ~2.5'x1.7', sharply concentrated with a very bright core and much fainter outer halo.  There is some ill-defined structure in the halo, either due to dust, spiral arms or both.  NGC 3802 is 2.3' N, MCG +03-30-035 is 3.4' SW, NGC 3803 is 4.5' N, NGC 3790 is 7' WSW and NGC 3806 is 8' NE.  MCG +03-30-035 (B = 16.6) appeared fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 4:1 SW-NE, ~40"x10".  A mag 11.5 star is  2.4' preceding.


18" (5/12/07): moderately bright, fairly large but moderately low surface brightness, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, broad concentration with a brighter core that increases to a small, brighter nucleus.  Brightest in a group including NGC 3790 7' W and NGC 3802 2.3' N.


17.5" (4/1/95): brightest in a group.  Fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 1.2'x0.8', broad concentration to a brighter core.  Forms a close pair with NGC 3802 2.3' NNE.  Also in the field are NGC 3790 7.0' WSW and NGC 3806 8.1' NE.  Located 7' WNW of mag 8.7 SAO 99729.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3801 = H III-30 = H II-161 = h939 on 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 170) and recorded III-30 as "vF, pS, r, preceded by two vB stars."  His position is only 8 sec of RA following NGC 3801 = UGC 6635, although John Herschel (in the GC) and Dreyer (in the NGC) assumed it applied to NGC 3802, 2.3' north of NGC 3801.  A month later, on 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 198), he returned to the field and recorded II-161 as "F, not S, R, bM."  His position on this sweep is 4' too far south.  John Herschel made 3 observations and his mean position matches UGC 6635.


Since WH observed only one object near this position on both sweep 170 and 198, we can assume he picked up the brighter galaxy NGC 3801 both times, and missed NGC 3802.  In fact, he was uncertain if H. II-161 was new or identical to H. III-30, though decided to assign it a new internal number.  So, H. II-161 = H. III-30 = NGC 3801 and JH should be credited with the discovery of NGC 3802.  Wolfgang Steinicke confirmed these conclusions (email on 7/15/14).

William Herschel rediscovered NGC 3804 = H II-830 on 18 Mar 1790 (sweep 951) and recorded "pB, E.  I saw it too late to describe it properly." CH's reduced position is within 2' of UGC 6640.  He originally discovered this galaxy on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 920) and logged "cF, pS, just following a vS star."  It was catalogued as III-773 and later as NGC 3794.  There was probably just enough difference in position and description for both Herschel and Dreyer to assume the objects were different, but there is only one galaxy here.  So, NGC 3804 = NGC 3794.  The primary designation should be NGC 3794 (earlier discovery), but it is known as NGC 3804 because of the more accurate position.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3805 = H III-375 = h941 on 25 Apr 1785 (sweep 401) and logged "eF, S, but strong twilight and moonlight make it impossible to describe it properly."  JH reported "Not vF; S; R; bM." and measured a fairly accurate position.

48" (4/2/11): last of 6 in the NGC 3801 group.  At 375x appeared fairly bright, large, slightly elongated N-S, 1.4'x1.2', broad weak concentration but no core.  Located  8' NE of NGC 3801 and 5' N of mag 9.2 HD 101485.  NGC 3807 is probably a 16th magnitude star 2.4' NE of NGC 3806, although the two numbers are equated in the UGC and PGC and repeated in Megastar.

Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 3806 on 3 Apr 1851.  While observing NGC 3802 he noted "another vF neb, about 6' nf."  On 6 Apr 1855, R.J. Mitchell logged it as "vvF, R, lbM."  UGC 6641 lies 6.9' NE of NGC 3802, so this identification is certain.  The 1861 LdR publication mentions "2 'novae' near [NGC 3801 and 3802], probably a 3rd." but does not give Stoney's offset from NGC 3802.


Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered this galaxy on 21 Apr 1862 and noted a mag 9-10 star is 5' south.  His position is accurate and both John Herschel (in the GC) and Dreyer (in the NGC) credited d'Arrest with the discovery, although d'Arrest commented his object might be identical to one of the two LdR novae mentioned in the 1861 publication.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3847 = h965 on 3 Apr 1831 and recorded "not vF; S; R psbM."  His position matches UGC 6708.   Rudolph Spitaler's position is 7.5' too far north (error in offset star?) and Max Wolf misidentified this galaxy on a Heidelberg plate.  As a result the "corrected" declination in the IC 2 Notes section is off by 10'.  Sinnott's NGC2000.0 repeats this erroneous position.  It is possible that either NGC 3855 or NGC 3856 (found by d'Arrest but with a poor position) is a duplicate of this galaxy.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3848 = H III-35 on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 174), along with NGC 3852, and described both as "Two, very small, and eF.  Their situation is in the same parallel of declination, and distance perhaps 3 or 4 minutes.  It took up some time to see them well."


The RNGC identifies MCG +02-30-023 = CGCG 068-046 as NGC 3848 (the closest galaxy to his position) though there is only a single object here "in the same parallel of declination".  Malcolm Thomson feels that CGCG 068-046 is a reasonable match in position.  CGCG 068-046 is not labeled NGC 3848 in MCG or CGCG.


Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 3848 and NGC 3852 are probably duplicate observations of NGC 3822 and NGC 3825 (found again by WH a month later!).  This pair is 2.0 min of RA west of WH's position and 1-2' south.   The separation of this pair is 3.2' (roughly east-west), agreeing with WH's description, so this identification seems more liekly likely.

A mag 16.3 star is off the southeast side [27" from center].  An extremely faint "star" was noted off the northwest side [25" from center].  After later checking the SDSS, I discovered this is a compact galaxy (SDSS J114534.52+031417.8) with V = 17.8.  An extremely faint edge-on poking out of the east side of IC 730 was not seen.


17.5" (4/9/99): faint, small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 25" diameter, no concentration.  Visible steadily with direct vision.  A mag 15 star lies 1.6' SSW.  This is a Todd discovery and due to a poor position is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  This galaxy is listed as IC 730 (good position from Javelle) in modern catalogues.


David Todd discovered NGC 3849 = Todd 10 on 11 Feb 1878 in his search for trans-Neptunian planets with the 26-inch refractor at the Naval Observatory.  He noted a "large and nebulous" object with a star 2' in PA ~210° (SSW).  There is nothing at his rough position, but using Todd's discovery sketch, Harold Corwin identifies NGC 3849 =CGCG 040-040.


Javelle found this galaxy on 22 Mar 1893 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory and measured an accurate position.  Javelle and Dreyer assumed J. 2–728 was new, so it acquired the designation IC 730.  All modern catalogues label this galaxy as IC 730 only.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3852 = H III-36, along with NGC 3848, on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 174), and described both as "Two, very small, and eF.  Their situation is in the same parallel of declination, and distance perhaps 3 or 4 minutes.  It took up some time to see them well."  There are no pair of galaxies fitting this description near his position and both numbers were equated by Dreyer in his 1912 NGC Correction list (repeated by Reinmuth).


In his 1912 update of WH's catalogues, Dreyer notes that NGC 3852 was not found by Bigourdan but possibly there was a 1 tmin error in RA in reducing the position.  Corwin suggests NGC 3848 and NGC 3852 may be duplicate observations of NGC 3822 and NGC 3825.  These galaxies have the same declination and 3.2' separation but lie 2.0 tmin west of H's position.  So, NGC 3852 = NGC 3825 and NGC 3848 = NGC 3822 seems the most likely scenario, although this identification is uncertain.

Alphonse Borrelly found NGC 3853 around 1871 with a 7.2-inch comet-seeker at the Marseille Observatory. His description reads "R, lE, small ncl at center" and his micrometric position in AN 1885 (4th object) matches UGC 6712.


WH probably discovered this galaxy on 30 Dec 1783 (sweep 72) and logged "Some minutes after 32, I saw a small nebula, but in looking a good while at the finder to determine its place, lost is again.  I suspect partly that is consists of a few vS stars, but shall look for it another night."  Although he was completely uncertain on the minute of RA, his polar distance is an exact match with NGC 3853.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 3854 = LM 2-449 in 1886 and reported "mag 14.5, 0.3' dia, lE 70°, gbsbMN."  There is nothing close to his position.  The brightest galaxy in the vicinity is NGC 3865 = PGC 36581, 28 seconds of RA east and 9' north.  Harold Corwin lists this galaxy as the most likely candidate.  Due to the unusually large discrepancy in declination and only a fair match in PA (70°), this identification is very uncertain. RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  See Corwin's notes.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3855 on 8 May 1864 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His single observation gives a rough declination (marked to the nearest arcmin and very uncertain) and mentions a companion to the north [NGC 3856], though without a position or even offset.  There are a number of galaxies in the vicinity, but none exactly matching in RA.


When Rudolph Spitaler looked for the pair in 1891 with 27-inch refractor at the Wien Observatory, he identified CGCG 186-31 as NGC 3855 and UGC 6709 as NGC 3856 (published in AN 3167-68).  His positions (roughly 17 tsec of RA west of d'Arrest's position) are given in the Notes and Corrections section of the IC 1.  Stephane Javelle independently found these galaxies on 11 Jun 1896 at the Nice Observatory and they were later catalogued as IC 2952 and IC 2953.


UGC, MCG and CGCG label these galaxies using the IC designations.  RNGC, MCG and CGCG identify CGCG 186-036 as NGC 3855.  This is a very small galaxy located 5' SE of the close pair.  RNGC classifies NGC 3856 as nonexistent. It seems very unlikely that CGCG 186-036 was the single galaxy seen by d'Arrest as IC 2953 in the same field is both larger and more prominent visually.


If we accept Spitaler's corrected positions in the IC 2 notes, then NGC 3855 = IC 2952 and NGC 3856 = IC 2953.  Malcolm Thomson proposes NGC 3855 = IC 2953 and NGC 3856 = CGCG 186-036, though the fainter galaxy would be located southeast, instead of north as d'Arrest mentions.  Harold Corwin argues d'Arrest most likely picked up the two brightest galaxies in the vicinity.  So, he proposes NGC 3855 = IC 2953 and NGC 3856 = NGC 3847, though the latter galaxy is nearly 10' to the north.  So, although NGC 3855 is most likely IC 2953 (brightest galaxy nearest d'Arrest's position), the identification of NGC 3856 is very uncertain.

John Herschel discovered NGC 3871 = h967 on 3 Apr 1831 and noted "eF; R; gbM.  The preceding of 3 [with NGC 3880 and 3881] forming an equilateral triangle.  Place very rough."  There is nothing at his position (given only to the nearest min of RA and min of Dec; both marked as +/-), but 1 min 15 sec of RA due east is UGC 6744, which perfectly fits his description.

Stephane Javelle found this galaxy again when he went through the region on 11 Jun 1896 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory and because of JH's poor position assumed it was new.  So, NGC 3871 = IC 2959.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3873 = H III-387 on 27 Apr 1785 (sweep 403) and noted "vF, vS, R."  His position matches the double system NGC 3873/3875 so III-387 could apply to either component.  But it's reasonable to assume he picked up NGC 3873, which is slightly brighter and larger visually.


When Heinrich d'Arrest observed III-387 on 8 May 1864, he discovered it was double and measured both components.    He applied III-387 to the northwest component and wrote "Double Nebula, seen [by WH] as single in 1785.  Estimated distance = 52", PA = 119°.  The north-preceding [NGC 3873] is a little brighter and the view is the fainter [NGC 3873] is extremely difficult.  Both are only 2'."   But when Dreyer added d'Arrest's "nova" to the GC Supplement (5582), he mistakenly wrote "III-387 sf", instead of "III-387 np".  Assuming III-387 applies to NGC 3873, then d'Arrest should be credited with the discovery of NGC 3875.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3874 = H III-104 on 15 Apr 1784 (sweep 194) and recorded "I suspect a vF, vS nebula; but there is too much twilight to verify it."   There is nothing at his position and Bigourdan was unable to find this nebula on two occasions.


Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel Nebel", notes "F double star in Dreyer's place."  Harold Corwin agrees with this identification.  The only galaxy near his position is NGC 3863, but this galaxy is 45 sec of RA west and 5' south of WH's offsets.

He attached the designation III-387 to the north-preceding object.  Dreyer added d'Arrest's "nova" to the GC Supplement (5582), using d'Arrest's mean position (two observations) but mistakenly noted "III-387 sf", instead of "III-387 np".

At 200x, it appeared fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 2'x1', weak concentration.  A mag 12 star sits at the SSE edge and a mag 13.5 star is close off the SE end.  A faint star barely off the NW end appears to be a very close double.  In addition, 4 or 5 fainter stars are superimposed on the unconcentrated glow!  Located 2.4' WSW of mag 8.8 HD 102323.


This galaxy was misclassified as a diffuse nebula in the RNGC and as a reflection nebula in the Sky Atlas 2000.0, probably because it is embedded in the Milky Way.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3882 = h3358 on 3 Apr 1834 and recorded "vF; lE; has two stars in it."  His position is just off the north side of ESO 170-011.

I'm not certain where the first misclassification occurred, although Sven Cederblad included it as a nebula.

Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant, discovered NGC 3889 on 13 Mar 1852.  While observing NGC 3888 he noted "another F, S, 5' nf."  The faint galaxy MCG +09-19-191 is situated 3.7' northeast of NGC 3888 and is a reasonable candidate in position and brightness.  But a second observation by Lawrence Parsons on 1 Apr 1878 confused the situation as he logged "Nova, vF, vS, Pos 167.2 deg (SSE), Dist 340.5"."  This placed the nebula southeast of NGC 3888 instead of northeast.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer was swayed by the second observation and placed NGC 3889 just 2 seconds of RA following NGC 3888 and 5.6' south and there is nothing at Parsons' position.


In an attempt to identify NGC 3889, the RNGC assigns it the same coordinates and new description as NGC 3850 which is located 17' WSW of NGC 3888!   Listed in my RNGC Corrections #1, WSQJ January 1985.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3890 = H III-940 on 12 Dec 1797 (sweep 1068) and recorded "vF, S, R, bM."  CH's reduced position (used in the GC) is 2.8' northwest of UGC 6788 = PGC 36925.  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position, although the NGC position is 1.0 min of RA too far west.


WH later rediscovered this galaxy on the sweep of 2 Apr 1801 with large systematic errors in position and catalogued it again as III-971 = NGC 3939.  The corrected position in MN, 71, 509, 1911 reveals III-971 = III-940.  Dreyer mentioned the 1 tmin error in the NGC position of NGC 3890 and the equivalance with NGC 3890 in his notes to the 1912 version of WH's catalogues.

48" (5/9/18): I was quite impressed with this gorgeous asymmetric spiral.  At 488x and 610x it appeared very bright, very large, oval 3:2 NNW-SSE, slightly over 3'x2'.  The slightly elongated core contains a bright, circular nucleus that rises to a very bright non-stellar peak.  A prominent spiral arm is rooted at the southwest side of the core.  It emerges to the south with a 15th mag star superimposed, and unfurls fairly sharply clockwise to the southeast as it separates from the core. The arm shoots nearly straight north on the east end of the halo, ending nearly 1.5' NNE of center.  The arm is relatively thin and has a high contrast with the much darker interarm gap to the west.  An easy HII knot is within the arm, 50" ESE of center, and a second bright knot with a stellar center is just 15" S.  The northern section of the arm is mottled but I didn't notice any specific knots.  A second thin arm is attached on the east or northeast side of the core.  It curls around the north side of the core to the west and ends at a mag 13.4 star [0.9' NW of center].  This arm has a sharply defined, hard outer edge at 610x.  Forms a pair (similar redshift) with NGC 3896 3.7' SE.


MCG +08-22-009 was also picked up in the field 5' NE.  It appeared bright (V = 14.6), fairly small, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, 20"x14", fairly high surface brightness. It contains a very small, very bright nucleus.


17.5" (4/7/89): fairly bright, moderately large, oval 3:2 NNW-SSE, 2.4'x1.6', broad moderate concentration, small bright core.

A mag 13.5 star is involved at the NW side 1.0' from the center and a mag 10.5 star is 3.1' SW.  Forms a pair with NGC 3896 3.7' SE.  NGC 3893 is a member of the NGC 3877 subgroup of the NGC 3992 (M109) group = LGG 258.

Bindon Stoney, observing on 15 Apr 1852 with LdR's 72", logged "Spiral probably, knot in south edge and a * outside preceding edge."  The next night he also noted the "spiral branch seems to start from the south edge and go round the following and n sides as far as the preceding star."  Further observations of the spiral structure were made in 1857 and 1861.

This galaxy is not catalogued in the MCG or CGCG and may be too faint for Swift to have noticed visually.  He called the galaxy "F[aint]", although he described difficult galaxies as "eF" or "eeF".  Even though there are no other nearby candidates, this identification is very uncertain.


The light-travel time for PGC 36967 is 1.1 billion years, and if seen by Swift is the second most distant galaxy in the NGC (after NGC 5609).

17.5" (4/15/93): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 4:3 NW-SE, brighter core, faint stellar nucleus.  NGC 3920 lies 10' W.  The identifications of NGC 3911 and NGC 3920 are reversed in all modern catalogues.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3911 = H III-341 = h991 on 10 Apr 1785 (sweep 394) and recorded "vF, vS, but little exceeding the stellar.  240 showed it very plainly."  His position is 3' southwest of UGC 6803, within his typical margin of error.


But when John Herschel reobserved this field, he assumed UGC 6803 was new and took UGC 6795, a fainter galaxy 10' west, as his father's III-341. Furthermore, he only measured the declination and failed to measure the RA for either object (as they were past the meridian), but adopted his father's RA for UGC 6795 (assuming it was H. III-341).  This confusion resulted in the CGCG and other modern catalogues reversing the identifications of NGC 3911 and NGC 3920.


The identifications given by Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin place the NGC labels on the historically correct galaxies, but this leaves the numbering out of order in RA (NGC 3920 precedes NGC 3911).  Instead, Courtney Seligman favors the NGC numbers in RA order with NGC 3911 on the western galaxy and NGC 3920 on the eastern.  He also assigns "H. III-314" on NGC 3920, the brighter galaxy.  This is consistent with modern catalogues.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3915 = H. III-113 on 24 Apr 1784 (sweep 205) and recorded "eF, eS.  240x showed 2 vS close stars with nebulosity between them; but probably a more favorable evening will prove it a deception."  There is nothing at his position (nor for NGC 3679 = H. III-112, the previous object in the sweep), though 1.0 min of RA preceding is IC 2963 and Wolfgang Steinicke identifies NGC 3915 as IC 2963.


Harold Corwin notes that the NGC position is from Christian Peters (in his Copernicus lists).   There is nothing near Peters' position (a bit further east than WH's), but perhaps he measured a poor position for IC 2963, which is 1.1 minutes of RA west of his position, or refers to IC 741, which is 19' N of his position.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 3915 might be LEDA 170172 at 11 46 55.6 -05 11 16 (J2000), though IC 2963 seems a more likely candidate to me.  PGC (and HyperLEDA) identifies NGC 3915 as IC 738 and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  With all these uncertainties, I've listed the number as Not Found.

NGC 3918 = PK 294+4.1 = ESO 170-13 = PN G294.6+04.7 = Blue Planetary

11 50 17.8 -57 10 56; Cen

V = 8.2;  Size 19"


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x the "Blue Planetary" has an even, extremely high surface brightness disc of 15" and a saturated, vivid blue color.  The edge is crisply defined and the disc has a uniform surface brightness.  At 350x, the planetary is oval or irregular, perhaps 18"x15".  There was no sign of the central star, though I didn't try high powers.


18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x appears as a bright, beautiful blue cosmic egg floating in a rich star field, ~15" diameter.  The surface brightness is extremely high and uniformly lit, with a sharply defined edge to the disc.  At 228x, the planetary appears to be set in the middle of an absorption hole in the Milky Way as there are very few faint stars in a 4' to 5' circular region surrounding the planetary.  Outside this hole, the Milky Way background is very evident and fairly bright.


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 195x, this 8th magnitude planetary appears as a beautiful 10"-12" blue disc with a very crisp edge.  No central star was glimpsed or other structural details at this magnification though the surface brightness is unusually high.  Situated in a rich star field but set near the middle of a oval 12'-13' ring of mag 11 and 12 stars which are near the periphery of the 17' field at 195x!  Located 8.4' SSW of mag 8.1 HD 102817 and 19' SW of mag 5.6 HD 103101.  The open cluster NGC 3960 lies 90' N.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, the "Blue Planetary" appears as a bright, round disc, ~15" diameter with a vivid blue color (V = 8.2).  The surface brightness is very high and the edge of the halo is crisply defined, but no structural details or central star were noted.  Good response to UHC filter, although it was unnecessary for a good view.  The Milky Way is quite rich here in faint stars but the planetary seems to be set a darker, circular hole without the faint background glow - a contrast affect with the PN?


John Herschel discovered NGC 3918 = h3365 on 3 Apr 1834 and described this planetary as "perfectly round; very planetary; color fine blue;...very like Uranus, only about half as large again and blue."  In a letter to Francis Baily from the Cape of Good Hope dated 22 Oct 1834, he added "On the 3d of April I discovered another fine planetary nebula, having a perfectly sharp disc, without the least haziness, of about 6" diameter.  The most remarkable feature about this is its evident blue colour, which needs not the presence of lamp light, or that of any red star, to be very conspicuous, as it appears when the nebula stands alone in a dark field."  On 5 Feb 1835 (sweep 543, the night described in his diary as "most superb" and "having attained the sublime of Astronomy - a sort of ne plus ultra") he wrote, he noted the color as "a beautiful rich blue, between prussian blue and verditter green...its outline is sharp and clean, and perhaps a very little elliptic.  A feeble lamp light gives a deep indigo contrasted color."


James Dunlop first recorded this planetary in the Brisbane Star Catalogue of 1826 as a "fine blue star” (#3807) but did not note its non-stellar appearance.


Joseph Turner and Pietro Baracchi (1885) sketched the planetary with the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate V, figure 57).


The term "planetary", of course, had been used by William Herschel but he never made an analogy to Uranus.  John Herschel wrote in his "A Treatise on Astronomy”, "They [planetary nebulae] have, as their name, exactly the appearance of planets."  He also reported the colors of several as shades of blue (NGC 7009, 7662, 3242, 3918).  See additional comments on M57.

Because of this confusion, the identifications of NGC 3911 and NGC 3920 are reversed in all modern catalogues.

The eastern component is the larger and brighter and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, ~30" diameter, sharply concentrated with a quasi-stellar nucleus at most 10" diameter.  The nucleus of the western galaxy was also easily visible at 225x and 375x and similar in brightness.  But only a 10" core could be distinguished as the halos are merged.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3927 on 27 Apr 1864 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  There are no stellar or nonstellar objects near his single position.  He mentioned the observation was beyond doubt, but the sky conditions were poor.  No one has suggested or found a plausible candidate.  Harold Corwin concludes "NGC 3927 is probably lost for good."


But in April 2015, after checking possible digit errors in d'Arrest's postion I found that if he made a 20 minute error in time (too large) then his position is a very close match with NGC 3713.  After notifying Harold Corwin, he concurs this is the only reasonable identification though still leaves a bit of uncertainty as d'Arrest failed to mention any nearby stars.

Located 2.5' E of a mag 13 star, the southernmost of three collinear mag 13/13.5 stars.  John Herschel mentioned a 7th magnitude star which followed due east by 3'.  This is Groombridge 1830, which has the third fastest known proper motion (7.04"/yr) and this star is now roughly 23' SE!


William Herschel discovered NGC 3930 = H III-616 = h1000 on 17 Mar 1787 (sweep 714) and recorded "vF, cS, just south of a star 6th mag.  I suspected at first that my glass had been affect with damp." On 23 Mar 1789 (sweep 915) he logged "eF, irr figure, 3 or 4' dia, resolvable.  About 5' south of a star 6th mag."  In his 1814 PT paper, WH mentions that on one observation he logged "A star of the 6th magnitude, about 5' north of a very faint nebula, or an irregular figure."  But on a observation two years before, the two objects were then so near each other, as, at first sight, it caused a suspicion that some damp had settled upon the eye-glass and affected the star.  He commented this might suggest that the nebula had a considerable proper motion, though differences in observing conditions might account for the difference.   Coincidentally, this star is Groombridge 1830, which has the third fastest known proper motion of 7.04"/yr and this star is now roughly 23' SE!  But in a two-year period there was not a significant proper motion of the star.

48" (5/10/18):  at 375x; I was very impressed with this gorgeous face-on spiral!  Very bright, roundish, over 4' diameter, strongly concentrated with a well defined, very bright round core and bright stellar nucleus. Three principal spiral arms were easily visible.  A thin inner arm can be traced 180°; it originates just south of the core and curls counterclockwise towards the west.  It dims out as it extends north along the west side [~0.6' from center] but brightens noticeably as it spirals out and detaches from the central region on the northwest side, ending nearly due north [1.3' from center].  A shorter outer arm on the west side was easily visible [at a radius of 1.5'], curving 90° from the southwest to the northwest.  These two western arms are separated by a darker interarm gap


The eastern arms have a noticeably lower contrast.  The inner eastern arm can be traced with the help of a wide, darker dust lane immediately to its east.  The arm disappears into the halo on the south side but just further west two small HII knots, ~6" diameter each, were visible. The knots are separated by 20" E-W, and isolated on the southwest edge of the halo.  The 1983 Hodge-Kennicutt "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies" includes multiple designations including #120 [1.4' SSW of center] and #140 [1.5' SW of center].  A 15th magnitude star is ~1' W, just beyond the halo on the SW end.


The outer arm on the eastern edge of the halo could mostly be traced by three HII knots within the arm.  The largest is an easily visible 12"-15" patch (#23) on the NE edge of the halo [2.2' from center]. Also 2' ENE of center are a pair of faint knots only ~5" diameter.  These are separated by 12" in a N-S orientation, with the northern knot (#3) slightly brighter than the southern (#4).


17.5" (4/6/91): fairly bright, fairly large, large round halo, 3'x3', fairly weak concentration, core appears elongated E-W, faint stellar nucleus embedded.  This galaxy, along with NGC 4051 and NGC 4111, are the brightest members of the NGC 4111 group (LGG 269) in the UMa Cloud.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3938 = H I-203 = h1002 on 6 Feb 1788 (sweep 810) and recorded "cB, cL, R pBNM."  JH made two observations, logging on sweep 248 "a superb nebula; B; vL; R; 3' diam; vgbM; r; is probably a globular cluster."


On 17 Mar 1849, Johnstone Stoney logged that he "Suspect it to be a spiral.  Lord Rosse and I independently thought at moments that were saw a ring around the nucleus.  Two years later, Bindon Stoney wrote "Spiral of the faintest class.  The middle is pB, but branches vF.  Conjectured form as in diagram [which shows a 3-armed spiral]."

William Herschel found NGC 3939 = H III-971 on 2 Apr 1801 (sweep 1096) and noted "eF, vS, R."  This is one of 15 far northern galaxies with large systematic errors. A corrected position matching UGC 678 was published in 1911 using plates taken at the Greenwich Observatory with the 30-inch reflector.  Dreyer repeated this position in the notes to his 1912 edition of WH's catalogues.  See NGC 2938 for more on sweep 1096 or Harold Corwin's full story in his notes for NGC 3752.


Interestingly, Herschel had already discovered this galaxy on 12 Dec 1797 (sweep 1068) and it was catalogued as H. III-940 (later NGC 3890).  So, NGC 3939 is a duplicate of NGC 3890.

William Herschel discovered NGC 3952 = H III-612 = h1012 on 11 Mar 1787 (sweep 709) and noted "vF, cS, E."  Caroline's reduction is 2' north of MCG -01-30-044 = PGC 37285.  John Herschel made 3 observations and on sweep 147 called it "F; lE; nearly in parallel; resolvable??"


Lewis Swift found this galaxy on 23 Mar 1895 and reported Sw. XI-127 (later IC 2972) as "vF; pS; R; 2 B stars n and np; s of 2 [with IC 2969]."  His position is very close to NGC 3952, so it's surprising that neither Swift nor Dreyer realized the equivalence IC 2972 = NGC 3952.

48" (5/2/19): at 375x and 545x; very bright, large spiral with 3 visible arms, extending .nearly 6'x2.5' SSW-NNE  The galaxy is sharply concentrated with a very bright, round nucleus.  A moderate contrast bar extends through the nucleus in a SW-NE orientation.  A long, gently curving spiral arm extends north into the outer halo and curves counterclockwise to the NE.  A low contrast, long spiral arm (~2.5' in length) drapes due south on the east side of the core/bar.  A mag 14.5 star is just within this arm [0.9' NE of center]. An extremely faint HII patch is east of this arm at the edge of the halo [1.4' E of center].  Finally, an outer section of the southern spiral arm was easily seen and brightest in a patch at the south tip [2' from center].  The arms bends sharply from SW to NE at the outer end.  A mag 14 star is close to the W edge [51" from center].

16x80 finder (3/19/88): visible as a fairly large, elongated patch.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3953 = H V-45 = h1011 on 12 Apr 1789 (sweep 919) and recorded "cB, Br N with F branches, 6 or 7' l, 3 or 4' br."  JH reported "B; L; vsbM; r; 3' diam.  Fine object."


It has been proposed that NGC 3953, and not NGC 3992, is the object discovered by Pierre Méchain, and associated with M109.  See http://www.astrobril.nl/FortinOther.html#M109


Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant on 3 Mar 1851, reported "S neb, vF, 6' npp."  Although this object was not mentioned again in 3 later observations at Birr Castle, it probably refers to 16th magnitude PGC 2412642, 4.5' WNW of center (Steinicke concurs).  R.J. Mitchell sketched the galaxy on 19 Apr 1857 at Birr Castle (included in LdR's 1861 publication).

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3966 on 8 May 1864 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  He noted a mag 12-13 star that precedes by 4.1 seconds of time and 22" south (separation of 49" from the nebula) but there is nothing at his single position.  Max Wolf suggested in list VIII that d'Arrest's RA was off by 30 seconds and Dreyer copied this "correction" into the IC 2 notes.   The corrected position matches CGCG 157-056 = IC 2981 (see that number) and RNGC, MCG, CGCG and PGC identify CGCG 157-056 as NGC 3966.


But Harold Corwin (e-mail from 6 Mar 1998) notes that NGC 3986 has a star at the exact separation given by d'Arrest, although this galaxy is over 20' southeast of d'Arrest's position (one of his few very poor positions).  Curiously, d'Arrest mentions he was searching for h1027 = NGC 3986!   So, NGC 3966 = NGC 3986.  See Corwin's identification notes.

Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy on 27 Apr 1886 and reported it in his 3rd discovery list (#61). Both Holden and Swift are credited in the NGC. Swift found the galaxy again 11 years later on 23 May 1897, while observing at Echo Mountain in southern California.  His last observation (Sw. XI-129) was off by 1.5 min in RA too far west so Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 2976.  Corwin notes this galaxy was "discovered twice by Lewis Swift, once toward the beginning of his systematic sweeping for new nebulae (April 1886), and once toward the end (May 1897)."  So, NGC 3979 = IC 2976, with discovery priority to Holden.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 3980 = Sw. I-18 on 16 Apr 1885 and noted eF; pL; pE; v diff; D neb nr."  His position is just 7 sec of RA east of NGC 3977 (discovered by WH in 1789).  Both Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 NGC correction paper, and Harold Corwin equate NGC 3980 with NGC 3977. The "D[ouble] neb nr" might apply to NGC 3990 and 3998, though the NGC description reads "D star nr", which would then apply to a mag 12/13 double star 2.5' east-southeast.  Another possibility is that NGC 3980 refers to NGC 3972.  This galaxy is a better fit with Swift's description "pL; pE", but it is further off in position (6' southwest).

48" (4/20/17): at 488x; bright, large, very elongated 4:1 SSW-NNE, ~2.5'x0.6'.  The central region consists of a bright very elongated bar-like core that condenses to a small brighter nucleus.  A fairly thin, straight arm is evident extending north by over 1' on the east side of the galaxy.  The counterpart extending south on the west side was more difficult to distinguish from the halo on the south side.  A low contrast knot (VV 8b) was visible on the south tip of this arm [1.2' SSW of center].  Vorontsov-Velyaminov interpreted this knot as a companion attached at the end of a spiral arm.

See observing notes for NGC 3971 and UGC 6943 (identified as NGC 3984 in modern catalogues).  Identification not certain.


John Herschel discovered NGC 3984 = h1026 on 10 Apr 1831 and recorded "eF; R: bM; 25"."  He later added "Supposed at the time to be II.724 [NGC 3971], but on reducing the obs, it differs 1 min in RA and 1 deg in PD, BOTH which can hardly be mistakes."  There is nothing at his position.


Modern catalogues (including RC3) label UGC 6943, an extremely low surface brightness face-on spiral with two stars nearly superimposed, as NGC 3984.  This galaxy is 1 min 15 sec of RA following JH's position as well as 2.5' north.  This identification seems very unlikely due to the faintness of the galaxy and the fact that the bright nearby stars were not mentioned.  Malcolm Thomson concludes that NGC 3984 is nonexistent.


Harold Corwin agrees that the NGC 3984 ≠ UGC 6943 but feels that despite errors in both RA and Dec, NGC 3984 is most likely a reobservation of NGC 3971.  These entries were recorded on different sweeps and although NGC 3971 was described as "pB, R, bM", there are many situations where Herschel made very discordant estimates of brightness.

24" (3/22/14): fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 3:1 or 7:2 NW-SE, 1.2'x0.35', weak concentration.  Two mag 11.5-12 stars are off the NW end.  Sandwiched between NGC 3997 3.0' NE and NGC 3987 4.7' SE.  Also NGC 3989 is 2.5' W.


17.5" (3/19/88): faint, fairly small, very elongated NW-SE, broad concentration.  Forms a pair with NGC 3989 2.7' WSW.  Member of the NGC 4007 group.


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 3993 on 25 Apr 1854 and it was labeled "Eta" on the constructed sketch of the group made at Birr Castle.  In a later observation, a very faint star was noted close south-following and two mag 11-12 stars north-preceding.  The micrometric position is very accurate.


Harold Corwin notes that WH's III-324 refers to NGC 3997 and not NGC 3993 as Dreyer assigned in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH".  But Wolfgang Steinicke lists WH as the discoverer of NGC 3993 on 6 Apr 1785 (sweep 393), probably due to the better match in position.

24" (5/25/14): at 375x appeared fairly bright, elongated oval 5:2 SSW-NNE, 0.8'x35', well concentrated with a very bright core.  Second in a striking trio (KTG 39) with NGC 3995 1.9' NE and NGC 3991 3.8' NNW.


17.5" (2/24/90): moderately bright, small, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, prominent core.  Second of three elongated systems with NGC 3991 3.8' NNW and NGC 3995 1.8' NE.  Located 5' WNW of mag 6.4 SAO 62774.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3994 on 6 Apr 1864 with the 11" refractor at the Copenhagen Observatory.  His position, measured on 3 nights, is accurate and he accurately placed a mag 15 star (called 17th magnitude) the precedes by 4 seconds due west.

24" (5/25/14): fairly bright striking galaxy with unusual asymmetric structure, fairly large, elongated roughly 5:2 SSW-NNE, well concentrated with a very bright core containing a short bar oriented E-W.  A long linear arm is attached at the west side of the core and extends south ~40".  The outer, western edge of this arm has a sharply defined edge and the inner (eastern) side has a low, irregular surface brightness.  A short extension (arm) heads northeast from the east side of the core.  As a result the core appears offset towards the north, because of the longer southern arm.  Mag 6.4 HD 103928 lies 5' ESE and was placed outside the field.


17.5" (2/24/90): moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, large bright core.  Third and largest of an excellent trio with NGC 3994 1.8' SW and NGC 3991 3.8' NW.  Located 6.6' W of mag 6.4 SAO 62774.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 3995, along with NGC 3991, on 5 Feb 1864.  His position, measured on 3 nights, is accurate.

17.5" (5/11/02): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 0.7'x0.5', nearly even surface brightness.  A line of stars oriented SSW-NNE precedes the galaxy and two mag 13.5-14 stars follow.  Located 20' ENE of a mag 6.7 star and 2.1° ESE of Beta Leonis (Denebola).


John Herschel discovered NGC 3996 = h1032 on 23 Apr 1832 and logged "vF; pL; R; has two stars sf."  This was one of the last two objects discovered by Herschel at Slough (the following year he set sail for the Cape of Good Hope), though he measured the position again on the 26th and 28th of April.

24" (3/22/14): moderately bright to fairly bright, moderately large, irregular, ~1.0'x0.7'.  Contains a small brighter core embedded in a curving bar oriented ~E-W.  There was an impression of weak spiral arms in the halo.  Bracketed by two mag 12.5-13 stars just off the east and southwest side.  Brightest and fourth in a string with NGC 3993 3' SW and NGC 3987 7.7' SW.


17.5" (3/19/88): faint, small, elongated ~E-W (central bar), small bright core.  Bracketed by two mag 12 stars 0.9' E and 0.9' SW of center.  Member of the NGC 4007 group.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3997 = H III-324 = h1033, along with NGC 3987 = H III-323, on 6 Apr 1785 (sweep 393) and recorded "vF, lE. Suspected another eF, about 5' or 6' nef.  I was pretty sure of it."  NGC 3997 is 7.8' NE of NGC 3987, while NGC 3993 is 4.7' NE, so either could apply but NGC 3997 is slightly brighter.  JH measured an accurate position and described "F; vS; E pos 25° Between 2 stars, 80" dist."


The two WH numbers have been applied to different galaxies. JH equated NGC 3997 = H III-323 in the Slough catalogue.  Dreyer gave a possible equivalence of NGC 4015 = H III-323 and NGC 4021 = H III-324 in the NGC, which in the 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH", Dreyer equates NGC 3987 = H III-323 and NGC 3993 = H III-324.

18" (4/30/11): very bright, fairly large, slightly elongated 5:4 NNW-SSE, 1.8' diameter.  Sharply concentrated with a small, blazing core that increases to a very bright stellar nucleus. NGC 3990 lies 3' due W.  Brightest in a group of 6 galaxies in a 30' field.  NGC 3998 is a member of the UMa NED1 (LGG 241) subgroup of the M109 group or UMa cloud.


17.5" (4/6/91): very bright, fairly small, slightly elongated 4:3 NW-SE, sharply concentrated with a round very bright well-defined core, increases to stellar nucleus.  Located 5.6' SSE of mag 9.2 SAO 28204.  Forms a pair with NGC 3990 3.0' W.  Brightest in a group including NGC 3982, NGC 3972 and NGC 3977.


William Herschel discovered NGC 3998 = H I-229 = h1031 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 920), along with NGC 3990, and recorded both as "Two, the last [NGC 3998] cB or vB, R, vgbM.  The preceding [NGC 3990] pB, E, S."  His offset from NGC 3990 (22 sec of RA) is accurate.

24" (3/22/14): very faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, even surface brightness.  Situated 1.4' E of a mag 12 star and 4.5' SSW of mag 8 HD 103913.  A string of gaalxies oriented NW to SE begins with NGC 4000, which lies 4.5' N.


17.5" (4/18/98): extremely faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.  Requires averted vision and can only hold steadily 2/3 of the time.  A mag 12 star is 1.5' preceding.  Located 4.6' SSW of mag 7.4 SAO 82077 in the NGC 4005 cluster.  The RNGC identification is incorrect.


Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 3999 on 25 Apr 1878 in one of the six Birr Castle observations of the NGC 4005 cluster.  Parsons placed this nebula at 277" separation in PA 201.3° (SSW) with respect to mag 8 HD 103913 and it was labeled as Mu on the composite sketch of the cluster.  At this exact offset is CGCG 127-117 = PGC 37647.  The RNGC position is clearly in error and points to a blank piece of sky (closer to NGC 4011).  Listed in my RNGC Corrections #3.
