17.5" (2/11/96): faint, fairly small, round, 40" diameter, weak concentration to a slightly brighter 15" core.  A mag 13.5 star is just 1.0' N of center.  Located 12' WSW of mag 9 SAO 93675.


This galaxy is identified as IC 2002 in UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 due to a poor declination by Marth. RNGC reverses the sign of the declination.


Stephane Javelle found IC 2002 = J. 3-983 on 21 Dec 1903 and described "Weak, elongated in the direction of the meridian [N-S], a star is north, very weakly condensed."  His position matches UGC 2898 = PGC 14065.  This galaxy was probably discovered by Albert Marth on 5 Oct 1864.  His position for m 93 (later NGC 1474) is 8' S of this galaxy, but this is the only nearby galaxy he could have picked up.  UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 only use the IC designation as the position is unambiguous, though online catalogues (NED, HyperLEDA and SIMBAD) equate NGC 1474 = IC 2002. In addition, PGC and RNGC reversed the sign of the declination of NGC 1474 (repeated in Roger Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 and amateur software including Megastar).  See my RNGC Corrections #6 and Corwin's notes.

V = 11.6;  Size 7"x6"


18" (2/4/08): easily swept up unfiltered at 115x as a vey small, blue-grey disc forming a close "double" with a mag 13.5 star just 18" SW.  At 220x the star is well separated and the planetary appears a bit irregular with an occasional sparkle.  Increasing the magnification to 325x, the appearance is definitely asymmetric with a fainter NW quadrant and an intermittent stellaring (superimposed star, knot, or the central star) to the SE of the geometric center.  At 450x, the dimmer quadrant on the NW side appears to bulge out slightly and the brighter region, centered to the SE, extends in an arc from the NE to the SW.  An occasional stellar sparkle was clearly visible, though it was difficult to pinpoint the location.


17.5" (3/1/03): easily picked up at 100x as a fuzzy blue-gray mag 11.5 star.  Excellent view at 380x: bright, small, 10" diameter, irregularly round with an irregular surface brightness.  There appears to be a knot (or offset central star?) on the SE side.  A mag 13.7 star is just off the SW side [18" from center].  Located 3' SW of a wide mag 9.5/11 pair.


8" (12/4/80): moderately bright, very small, just non-stellar at 125x and a definite disc is visible at 220x.  A wide double star is 3' NE (9.5/11 at 47" oriented NW-SE).


Rev. Thomas Espin discovered IC 2003 on 18 Jan 1907 with his 17.3-inch reflector while searching for new double stars.  He estimated a diameter of 5" but the following measured measured a size of 6.9"x6.35" in PA 10.5°.  This object is one of the final discoveries chronologically that made it into the IC II (Fleming found two new PN that year), and certainly the last visual discovery.

NGC 1509 = IC 2026 forms a close pair with MCG -02-11-012 = PGC 14389 just 1.2' W.  At first I thought it was a very faint mag 15-15.5 star, but with extended viewing, a 15" knot was seen.  This companion is often misidentified as IC 2026.


Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 2026 = Big. 376 on 16 Dec 1897 while searching for NGC 1509.  As Stone's rough position (to nearest minute of RA) is off by 4', Bigourdan misidentified a nearby star to the east-southeast as NGC 1509 and recorded the galaxy again as a "nova" (Big. 376).  Howe reobserved the field in 1899-1900 and measured an accurate position for NGC 1509 but Dreyer didn't notice the equivalence IC 2026 = NGC 1509.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2040 = Sw. XI-67 on 23 Dec 1897 and recorded "vF; vS; R; resolv[ability] susp.; [NGC] 1531-2 in field."  His RA is 40 seconds west of ESO 359-030, but there are no other galaxies nearby he might have picked up.  He returned to the NGC 1531/1532 field 6 nights later and discovered IC 2041 a second time (the first observation is IC 2048).  Knox-Shaw first suggested the equivalence of ESO 359-030 with IC 2040.  He listed this galaxy in a table of new nebulae found between 1909-11 at the Helwan Observatory, but remarked that it was "possibly identical with [IC] 2040."

IC 2045 (identified as NGC 1538 in RNGC and PGC) appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 20" diameter, very small slightly brighter core. IC 2045 is the brightest in a small group including IC 2047 5' ESE and Holmberg 73 (pair) 8' ESE.  With my 17.5" on 12/30/99, IC 2045 was logged as faint, very small, round, 20" diameter, weak concentration.  Situated between a mag 10 star 3' NE and a mag 9 star 5.5' SW.


Herbert Howe discovered IC 2047 = Ho. III-15 on 20 Jan 1900 and reported "eF, eS, difficult; near [NGC 1538]."   His position matches LEDA 941480.  Howe assumed Holm 73a = LEDA 3093623 was NGC 1538 as it is the closest galaxy to Stone's (rough) position.  But Harold Corwin, who examined Stone's sketch, states that IC 2047 is a better match with the sketch.  This implies Stone missed IC 2045 (also found by Howe), which is the brightest of the galaxies in this field.  So, we are left with three possible candidates for NGC 1538 and the identification is uncertain.

17.5" (12/26/00): this unusual yellow reflection nebula (also catalogued as Barnard 14) is embedded in Barnard 22 within the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud, the nearest large stellar nursery at 450 light-years.  At 100x (unfiltered), IC 2087 appears as a fairly faint direct vision object, moderately large, round, 3'-4' diameter.  Fairly well defined although the edges fade into background.  What is the striking is the location - only four brighter stars are visible in the 50' field with a complete lack of fainter stars down to mag 15!  The surrounding field also shows evidence of very high obscuration (extinction about 5 visual magnitudes in the vicinity).  Described by Barnard as a "very small, bright nebula, diameter 3"... "in the dark nebula B 22".


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2087 visually on 18 Jan 1892 with the 12-inch Lick refractor while observing a comet.  He noted "the small nebula is excessively difficult".  His photograph in "On a Nebulous Groundwork in the Constellation Taurus" (ApJ, 25, p218, 1907) reveals a long winding dark lane with a small nebulous region surrounding a couple of stars within the dark lane.

But Harold Corwin suggests NGC 1677 is a duplicate of NGC 1659, assuming Swift made a 5 min error in RA too far east.  See NGC 1677 for more.

A 2017 preprint reports "the discovery of a massive embedded star forming complex spanning about 500 pc which manifests itself as a younger, embedded twin of 30 Doradus. Previously known as N79, this region has a star formation efficiency exceeding that of 30 Doradus by a factor of about 2 as measured over the past ~0.5 Myr. Moreover, at the heart of N79 lies the most luminous infrared (IR) compact source discovered with large-scale IR surveys of the LMC and Milky Way, possibly a precursor to the central SSC of 30 Doradus, R136."  The listed position, 04 51 53.3 -69 23 29, coincides or is just immediately northeast of IC 2111.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 2111 = HN 85 in 1901 on Harvard objective prism plates and noted as "Planetary, stellar".  NGC 1722, the surrounding nebula, is plotted as an planetary nebula on the Skalnate Pleso "Atlas of the Heavens" as well as the Sky Atlas 2000.0

The first "star" is actually an extremely compact clump of O-type stars. The richest part of the cluster (LH 10) is 1.5' WSW.


Some sources (including NED) identify mag 11 HD 268726 as IC 2115.  This star is situated 45" W of HII knot LMC-N11A (probably IC 2116) and  ~1.5' NE of the two stars mentioned above.


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 2115 = Fleming 98 on a Harvard objective prism plate taken in 1901 at the Arequipa station.  The identification of IC 2115 is very uncertain as the published position is very poor - see Harold Corwin and Brian Skiff's thorough analysis.

30" (11/4/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): LMC-N11A (probably IC 2116) is a bright, high surface brightness knot, ~15" diameter.  It is located at or just beyond the northeast edge of the showpiece Bean Nebula (NGC 1763), roughly 3' NE of the center and certainly part of the same complex.  A mag 11 star (HD 268726) lies 45" W.


N11A is a compact, discrete object called an HEB (High Excitation Blob). This class is distinguished by high excitation, small size, high density and tightly linked to early states of massive star formation.  Examples include a similar object at the southeast edge of NGC 2083 (N159D), IC 2114 at the ESE edge of NGC 1748 (N83B), and an ionized blob at the north edge of NGC 2103 (N214C).


Williamina Fleming discovered IC 2116 = Fleming 88 on a Harvard objective prism plate taken in 1901 at the Arequipa station.  The published position for this number, as well as IC 2215, is in error.  See Harold Corwin's thorough analysis of this number.

13x80mm (1/15/07): first visual observation I've made of the Witch Head nebula.  Using my 80mm finder at 13x (24mm Panoptic) unfiltered a very large, ill-defined glow (~30'-40') was visible between 1-1.5° south of Beta Eridani.  This is the NE section of the Witch Head.  With averted vision the glow brightened and stood out fairly well compared to the background sky brightness.  This object was significantly fainter than Barnard's Loop but surprisingly was not a marginal observation or as difficult as expected.  I couldn't follow the nebula further south with any certainty.


Max Wolf discovered IC 2118 on a plate taken on 16 Jan 1891 with a 4-inch Millet portrait lens (1 hr exposure).  The discovery was announced in "The Great Nebula of Psi Eridani", MNRAS 65, 528 (1905).  There is no reference to the "Witchhead" shape in the paper.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2119 = Sw. XI-74 on 30 Nov 1897 and reported "eeeF; pS; bet 2 st; close to eeeF D*; eee diff."  There is nothing at his position but 9' N is ESO 553-005.  Howe was the first to make this identification in his review of Swift's IC objects (MN, Nov. 1900) and reported "Swift's declination is nearly 10' in error.  He says "close to eeeF D*."  The double is of mag 12.5 and 12.5, distance 90", and angle 210°.  The nebula is near the northern one of the two stars."  Howe's corrected position is accurate and was used in the IC 2 position, but Dreyer made a 10° error in the declination.  Corwin also points out that Howe made an error in his comments about the double star, which is much closer to the southeast.  Due to the IC error, this galaxy isn't labelled IC 2119 in many sources, including ESO, PGC and LEDA.

In his survey of NGC/IC objects at the turn of the century, Howe measured an accurate position (used in the IC) and gave a more accurate offset for the bright star. Swift might have found this galaxy again on 2 Feb 1889 while on a visit to Barnard at Lick Observatory.  See IC 408 for that story.

A mag 9.2 star (HD 35978), with an easy 15th mag companion, is just off the east side.  Excellent contrast boost with a NPB filter; the nebulosity appeared extremely bright, very high surface brightness, irregular shape and internal structure.  Quite striking!


N44K, ~2.5' W, appeared (using a NPB filter) fairly bright, fairly small, round, 40" diameter, brighter on the south edge.

N44H, located 3' N, appeared (unfiltered) surrounding a mag 14 star and a second much fainter star. Adding a NPB filter, the nebulosity appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30" diameter.  A mag 11.5 star is 1' SE.

N44E, located 4' NE, involves a mag 13 star along two mag 15+ stars.  Adding a NPB filter boosts the visibility of the nebulosity and it appeared nearly fairly faint, roundish, ~30" diameter.  A mag 13 star is close off the north edge.

N44L, just off the west side of N44E, was a very faint, small glow detached from N44E (using a NPB filter).

His position is 3' too far southwest and the brighter star (mag 9.9) is 5' ESE, not NE.  He probably found this galaxy again in Dec 1897, but his position for Sw. XI-78 (later IC 2129) is off by 30 seconds of RA and 5' in declination.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 2133 = Big. 385 on 22 Dec 1891.  His position matches NGC 1961, which was discovered by William Herschel in 1788 but given an erroneous position.  In the 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" Dreyer writes, "Caroline Herschel has used the place of the comparison star in Wollaston's Catalogue of 1790, which is very erroneous.  Auwers assumed it to be B.A.C. 1985, hence his very erroneous polar distance.  But it is = G. 1199 agreeing with two other stars, 42 and 43 Camelop.  The place of the neb found from this coincides with that of I.C. 2133 = Bigourdan 385."  So, NGC 1961 = IC 2133.  See Corwin's notes for more.

Lewis Swift found IC 2135 = Sw. XI-81 on 22 Feb 1898 and logged "eeeF; eeS; eeeE; ee diff[icult].  See note."  His RA is 35 seconds too small but the identification is certain.  The note reads "Nos. 56 [IC 335 = IC 1963] and 81 [IC 2135].  These in one respect are the most interesting nebulae I have ever seen, especially No. 56, which is a nebulous hair-line of one uniform size from end to end.  No. 81 at first sight seemed identical with it, but on a closer view the center seemed to have a very slight bulging in the middle."  Swift included both IC 335 and IC 2135 in a short article on "Remarkable Nebulae" in the 1902 Popular Astronomy after his observing career was ended.


Swift first discovered the galaxy on 9 Dec 1895, calling Sw. XI-82 (later IC 2136) "eF; pS; eE; almost a ray; 1963 p."  His position was 10° too far north, but IC 2136 = IC 2135.  According to Harold Corwin, PGC and RC3 misidentify this galaxy as NGC 1963.

Swift correctly placed the bright star to the east in his 6th Lowe discovery list, though in both lists the nearby galaxy should read NGC 1979.

Williamina Fleming discovered the emission spectrum of IC 2145 = HN 92 in 1901 on a Harvard objective prism plate.  The nebula was forstdiscovered by John Herschel in Dec 1834 and logged as "B, pS, R, lbM, follows a star 10m with other S stars about it.  Not observed in sweeping, but laid down in the drawing of Dec 4, 1837, whence its place is derived from the drawing fig 4, Pl III ."  JH's position and sketch clearly shows that NGC 2086 follows the mag 10 star and corresponds with a nebulous patch 12 seconds of RA following the bright star.  As Fleming didn't identify her object as NGC 2086, Dreyer catalogued it again, but IC 2145 = NGC 2086.

25" (4/6/19 - OzSky): at 244x; fairly faint, moderately large, roundish, diffuse with a low surface brightness, halo fades into the background, ~45" diameter.  A few very faint stars were resolved around the edges as well as a mag 14 star off the SW side.  Located 6' WNW of a mag 8.5 star.


A brighter group of stars including a mag 10.3 star and two mag 10.6 stars are within 5' to the north, making it very easy to pinpoint the location of IC 2161.  NGC 2203 lies 33' SE and NGC 2190 is 28' NNE.

24" (2/5/13): IC 2162 = Sh 2-255 is the brightest and easternmost of four round low-excitation emission glows with Sh 2-257 and Sh 2-254 lined up roughly to the west.  Using 125x (21mm Ethos) and H-beta filter, it appeared as a moderately bright, round glow, ~3.5' diameter, surrounding the mag 11.6 exciting star.  Sh 2-257 lies 5' W, and is a similar size, but surrounds several stars and has a lower surface brightness.  Sh 2-256 is a very faint detached glow off the SW side.


17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x unfiltered, IC 2162 was visible as the following of two faint, round glows surrounding mag 10.5-11 stars.  IC 2162 = Sh 2-255 is the brighter and larger of the pair, nearly 4' in diameter and quite symmetric.  Just under 5' due west is a separate 3' fainter glow (Sh 2-257).  This pair of low excitation emission knots is situated midway between two mag 6 stars with a 50' separation near the edge of the 20mm Nagler field.  Close southwest of Sh 2-257 is a very faint patch of nebulosity, Sh 2-256, but this was not seen visually, nor was the larger HII region Sh 2-254, a low surface brightness glow to the west (11' diameter).


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2162 visually on 30 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He first logged in his notebook "Found a v. difficult neb close f and involving a 10m star."  He added the comments "vF neb, pL, roundish, densest part following the 10m star." His field sketch and approximate offset from mag 5.9 HD 42954 pins down the identification with Sh 2-255 (eastern of a pair of faint HII glows).  Barnard notified Dreyer directly of the discovery.

48" (2/20/12 and 2/28/19): IC 2163 was stunning at 488x, attached at the east side of NGC 2207.  The central region is very bright, round, ~1' diameter, small bright core.  A prominent spiral arms is attached on the southwest side and sweeps gracefully to the east, curving gently clockwise.  The arm is ~1.5' long and significantly increased the overall size to roughly 2'x1'.


Just NE off the tip of the eastern arm is 2MASX J06163579-2122032, which appeared as a faint, very small knot.  Although this galaxy does not have a measured redshift, an HST study of NGC 2207/IC2163 (2001AJ....121..182E) found several apparent old globular clusters in its outer regions suggesting it's a dwarf elliptical galaxy at the same distance as IC 2163.


18" (2/5/11): forms the eastern component of an impressive interacting pair with NGC 2207.  At 225x, IC 2163 is an elongated glow embedded on the east side of the halo of the brighter galaxy.  IC 2163 appears fairly faint, moderately large, oval E-W, 1.0'x0.7', weakly concentrated.


13.1" (1/28/84): this is a colliding system with NGC 2207.  A double nucleus is visible and an extension just seen to the east is probably IC 2163.


Joseph Turner discovered IC 2163 on 15 Dec 1878 with the 48" Melbourne Telescope during an observation of NGC 2207.  He wrote, "It appears to consist of two nebulae" and his sketch clearly shows IC 2163 elongated E-W as a separate object to the east.  He noted "the preceding one [NGC 2207] seems to have three distinct nuclei or perhaps three small stars as represented above [in sketch]."  The discovery is on page 196 of his logbook, but was not included in the unpublished list of 6 new nebulae written in at the end of his logbook, as it was probably considered part of NGC 2207.


Pietro Baracchi also sketched the pair on 4 Jan 1886 with the Melbourne scope.  He shows IC 2163 as very extended E-W, indicating the spiral arms was seen extending east.


Herbert Howe rediscovered IC 2163 = Ho I-7 on 11 Feb 1898 with the 20-inch Clark refractor at Chamberlin Observatory in Colorado. He noted "eF, pS, follows NGC 2207 [by] 7 seconds."   Howe is credited with the discovery in the IC.  The IC2 Notes mentions "binuclear, surrounded by faint trace of ring".  This comment is based on a plate taken by DeLisle Stewart at Harvard's Arequipa station (date unknown).

17.5" (1/23/93): fairly faint reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10-11 star. This bi-polar nebula is fairly large, about 2.5' diameter.  Appears to extend further (or is brighter) on the south side.  Bordered by three collinear mag 13 stars on the south side.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 2167 = IC 446, along with IC 2169, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "a 9 1/2 mag star with largish faint nebula, a little heavier following."


He later found it again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the Willard 6" lens and announced it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Based on this discovery note, Dreyer catalogued it as IC 446.  Barnard states, though, he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweep over this region..I also found a 10 mag nebulous star about half a degree north preceding 2245."  His position in this paper is accurate.  Apparently Barnard also sent Dreyer his original visual discovery, so IC 2167 is based on his earlier visual discovery.  This object is a bi-polar reflection nebula. Listed in article on bi-polar nebulae by Ronald Stoyan in Deep Sky Observer #12.

24" (1/31/14): picked up unfiltered at 200x, though low contrast as the entire field is patchy in faint stars and affected by some dust.  Seems roughly 20'x10, elongated N-S and includes several bright stars (Cr 95) with mag 7.9 HD 46005 near the center (illuminating star), mag 8.9 HD 258853 near the south end, and a mag 9.3 star at or beyond the NW end.  The contrast is significantly improved at 125x using a NPB filter and the outline is better defined, particularly at the southern end.  Although the nebulosity is slightly brighter to the south of HD 46005, there are no high surface brightness sections.


18" (2/4/08): at 175x unfiltered, this is a huge, interesting reflection nebula, ~25'x18', elongated N-S with an irregular outline and subtle variations in brightness.  A number of mag 8-10 stars are superimposed, including mag 8 HD 46005 (illuminating star) which is part of a 10' N-S string of four brighter stars on the east side. Nearby reflection nebulae include NGC 2245 ~30' NE, IC 446 35' N and NGC 2247 40' NE (this group forms the association Monoceros R1).


IC 2169 is located two degrees due west of the Christmas Tree cluster and the whole region of bright and dark nebulosity is part of the same molecular cloud complex Mon OB1.


E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 447 = IC 2169, along with IC 446 = IC 2167, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "1 radius of 80x field [21'] south and 1 radius [21'] preceding the 7 1/2' m star [NGC 2245] is a large nebulosity, faint, that involves several 9 or 9 1/2 mag star.  Nearly 1/2° in size, irregular(?)".  His offset lands in the southern part of the nebula, though clearly he was referring to the entire portion.  He picked it up again on 26 Feb 1889 and logged "22' S and 22' p. the neb NGC 2245 is a vL neby, with some bright stars in it.  It is extended N & S nearly, 15 x 12' +/- diam.  There are 3 or 4 9th and 10th mag stars in a curve seemingly connected with it."


Barnard found this reflection nebula again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the Willard 6" lens and announced it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Barnard stated he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweeping over this region, I found a very large, weak, diffused nebulosity some half a degree south of the nebula NGC 2245. This was mixed up with several considerable stars."  His earlier visual discovery was not published but apparently he sent it later to Dreyer, so it was catalogued again as IC 2169.


Barnard retracted his discovery of IC 447 in Lick Publications, Vol 11, incorrectly claiming it to be identical to NGC 2245.  Hubble included this object in his 1922 paper "A general study of diffuse galactic nebula" in Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington, vol. 241, pp.1-38.

E.E. Barnard found IC 2172 on 30 Oct 1888 using the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted a "9 1/2 mag star with faint nebulosity about it.  1' in diameter, a little heavier nf.  Examined several other stars near, and no nebulosity seen."  His position corresponds with NGC 2282, discovered by Barnard himself on 3 Mar 1886 with the 6-inch refractor at Vanderbilt University (announced in AN 2756 and Sidereal Messenger, vol. 5, p154).  He reported finding "a star of 9.5 or 10 magnitiude, with a faint nebulosity surrounding it. I strongly suspect that is not a stellar point but an extremely small nebula with faint nebulosity surrounding.  At best with the 6-inch it did not appear like any of the neighboring stars.  A short distance (4' or 5') preceding this and very slightly north is a faint double star that I suspect is enveloped in nebulosity."  His position matches the central star HD 289120 of this reflection nebula.  Neither Barnard nor Dreyer noticed the equivalence of NGC 2282 and IC 2172.

Size 120'x40'


13x80mm (1/17/09): excellent view using of the Seagull Nebula using the 80mm finder with a 24mm Panoptic and a NPB filter.  This long sinuous river of nebulosity winds for approximately two degrees ~N-S beginning just south of open cluster NGC 2335 and curving to the west of a 4' pair of mag 5.4/7.7 stars, midway along its length.  The south end is skewed and curves towards the SE.  The nebula is brighter along a central filament, particularly near the midway point and a dark notch intrudes on the west side just south.  Although the 18" at 73x and UHC filter added more detail and structure only half of the entire Seagull could be viewed in one field.


13.1" (1/19/85): at 62x and UHC filter appears as a very large, very elongated strip of nebulosity.  At the north end is the open cluster NGC 2335 within Monoceros.  The southern portion is difficult to trace; it crosses into Canis Major and ends at an easily visible reflection nebula = Ced 90 surrounding a mag 8 star.  Also includes nebula NGC 2327 midway along the length.  This emission/reflection nebula is referred to as the Eagle or Seagull Nebula.


17.5" (2/2/02): On the NW side is a circular nebulosity (the head of the Seagull) catalogued as Gum 1 = vdB 93 = Sh 2-292.  At 100x it appeared as a very large, circular glow perhaps 15' in diameter of low surface brightness surrounding mag 7.1 V750 Mon with vague hints of structure. The OIII filter gave only a very weak enhancement, but the H-beta filter noticeably improved the contrast at low power.  This combination HII/reflection nebula is situated off the NW end of the huge winding IC 2177 strip that extends mostly to the south, and is a wonderfully rich region of the Milky Way with a number of clusters and star groups in the vicinity.


Off the south side is the smaller nebula Ced 90.  At 64x it appeared as a faint, round, 3'  haze surrounding a mag 8.5 star.  Two mag 10.5 stars are collinear off the east side, 2.5' and 3.3' from the center and several mag 12 stars are involved at the south edge.  The H-beta filter noticeably improves the contrast and makes the nebulosity a moderately bright, direct-vision object.  With averted vision the glow increases to 4'-5' in diameter with some very faint haze extending east.  The star density drops off immediately to the west, except for a few stars.  Ced 90 is located at the extreme southern tip of the 2.5 degree giant emission nebula IC 2177, which extends north into Monoceros.  This is one of a select group of low-excitation nebulae that can be added to the list of H-beta objects.


Isaac Roberts discovered IC 2177 photographically in 1898 surrounding mag 7.3 BD-10 1848.  His position (for the mag 7 star) and dimensions of 13' corresponds with the position of vdB 93 = Gum 1 = Sh 2-292, *not* the 2° N-S strip of nebulosity that is commonly identified as IC 2177 in modern catalogues!  The often photographed strip was discovered by Max Wolf in 1905. See Corwin's comments for the full story!


It was also found on a photograph taken on 1 Apr 1911 by Harry Wood at the Transvaal (Union) Observatory with the 10-inch Franklin-Adams camera.  Woods described it as a "large faint straggling region, about 2 1/2° long."  He added "BD -10° 1848 is involved in a bright patch of nebulosity, in which there are two large holes on the S side of the star."  This description refers to Gum 1 (photographed by Roberts).   He also noted "BD -12° 1771 is a nebulous star with an extension of the nebulosity on the Nf side; it looks like a comet."  This description refers to Sh 2-297 at the southern end of the region.

The nebula appears as a large, irregular glow unfiltered.  With careful viewing the west side is bowed in with thin extensions to the west on the north and south ends.  The nebulosity is not as extensive on the following side of the star.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): The "Toby Jug Nebula" is an unusual bipolar red reflection nebula 1.5 degrees north of NGC 2516.  Unfiltered at 105x, a fairly large irregular glow is visible surrounding the bright red M-class variable V341 Car = HD 65750 (mag 6.2-7.1).  The nebula is bowed towards the west with the curved section on the following side of V341.  It extends furthest to the NW and the SW and is indented and weaker due west of the star.  The total size of the "Toby Jug" is 2'-3'.


DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 2220 = DS 315 on a plate taken in 1908 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  He noted "!! Nebula involving [HD 65750], extends 2' in dec and 1' in RA, 2 B and 2 F spiral wisps, spiral in form."


IC 2220 was named the Toby Jug Nebula by Paul Murdin, David Allen and David Malin in their book "Catalogue of the Universe" published in 1979.  David Malin included the Toby Jug Nebula in his 1999 book "The Invisible Universe" and wrote, "A few degrees from the bright star Avoir and a little south of Miaplacidus is a curious nebula with the uninspiring catalog name IC 2220.  It has a popular name taken from its superficial resemblance to the profile of a toby jug, a traditional English beer mug with a large handle, with one side molded as a stout character with a rustic, painted face. My colleagues and I suggested the name Toby Jug in our book "Catalogue of the Universe" in 1978, and it seems to have stuck, even in the United States, where toby jugs are rarely seen."

Stephane Javelle found IC 2232 = J. 3-1028 on 12 Feb 1896.  His position matches UGC 4273 = PGC 23028.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by William Herschel but his position for NGC 2543 was 10 seconds of RA too small and his declination 5' too far south.  A second observation was even further off in declination.  John Herschel's position was off by two minutes in RA.  Dreyer published Spitaler's corrected position for NGC 2543 in the IC 1 notes section, but didn't catch the equivalence with Javelle's position.


William Herschel discovered NGC 2543 = H II-719 = h493 on 3 Feb 1788 (sweep 803) and recorded "F, pL, iR, bM."  His position is 10 sec of RA west and 5' south of UGC 4273. A second observation from 10 Mar 1790 (sweep 937) reads "In a line with a N.p. star, pB, cL, iR, vgbM."  The second observation is even further off in dec.


JH noted "vF; R; a course double * precedes points to it.  Deta RA = 1 m 2 sec."  There is nothing at his position but two minutes of RA west is UGC 4273 and two stars at 1.6' separation are northwest.  The RA given in the GC and NGC is ~1.0 tmin too far east but Rudolph Spitaler's micrometric position (measured on 24 Dec 1891 with the 27" refractor at Wien University Observatory) is accurate.  Stephane Javelle independently found the galaxy on 12 Feb 1896, assumed it was new and reported it in list 3-1028 (later IC 2232) with an accurate position.  So, NGC 2543 = IC 2232.

48" (4/15/10): this remarkably thin, beautiful superthin edge-on extends 4.0'x0.25' (~15:1 axial ratio) NNW-SSE.  Contains a brighter elongated central region with a slightly brighter nucleus (though no bulge).  The overall surface brightness is fairly low and the galaxy gradually dims near the ends of the extensions.  The center is situated only 0.9' SW of a mag 10 double (a mag 13.5 companion lies 13" away) and the orientation aligns with the center of the galaxy.  Roughly midway along the northern extension is a mag 14 star.  Beyond this star the galaxy gradually fades to the tip, extending to within 0.6' of a faint star off the NNW tip.  On the south extension, the galaxy also fades, but after nearly dimming out there is a feeble glow at the very tip that is slightly angled or bent towards the east.  Located 17' SE of the Bear-Paw galaxy.


17.5" (2/24/90): very faint, moderately large, extremely thin edge-on NNW-SSE with a low even surface brightness.

It was found sweeping along with NGC 2566, which was described as "the S. of 2, roundish, pB, two stars involved."  IC 2311 was noted as "the N one is pB, S, R, stellar nucleus (?).  It is 1/2 [150 dia field = 8'] north of the above neb.  They are both among scattered stars."  He later added the note "one of these is new - the other probably = NGC 2566."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2390 and communicated the discovery directly to Dreyer (not found in any of his published lists). His position matches CGCG 089-067 = PGC 24434.  This galaxy was possibly discovered by Marth in 1864 and catalogued as NGC 2643, though Marth's position 11' S and 18 seconds of RA too far east.  Although his declination is a poor match, nearby NGC 2637 which was discovered on the same night may have a similar declination error, so the identification NGC 2637 = IC 2390 is plausible.

13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica): very bright and large naked-eye cluster surrounding mag 3.6 Omicron Vel (just north of the False Cross).  Resolved in 9x50 finder and my 15x50 IS binoculars.  Includes 7 bright stars with a wide (1.3') bright pair of mag 5 stars on the east side.  The border of this scattered group is not well defined but the fainter stars fill out over a degree in the 20mm Nagler 66' field.


13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this very large naked-eye cluster appears as a fuzzy glow surrounding mag 3.6 Omicron Velorum (1.8° NNW of mag 2.0 Delta Velorum in the False Cross).  This scattered 50' group contains perhaps three dozen stars and barely fits in the field of the 20mm Nagler.  Perhaps a better view was obtained in the 9x50 finder or 10x30 IS binoculars which did a nice job of resolving the brighter stars, but the group was really too sparse and scattered to look impressive in the 13".


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): very bright naked-eye cluster with a few stars seen unaided.  Excellent resolution in 10x30 binoculars but still scattered as spread out over 50'.  Nice wide double star at edge.  Includes a half-dozen brighter stars.


Naked-eye (3/16/18, West Texas): I noticed the Omicron Vel cluster was fairly easily visible naked-eye as a fuzzy patch, though only 7° (or less) elevation at a latitude of +30.  It was partly resolved in 10x50 binoculars.


Persian astronomer Al-Sufi first mentioned IC 2391 = Lac II-5 in his "Book of Fixed Stars" (964 AD) as a "nebulous star."  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille observed it in 1751-1752 during his journey to the Cape and described a "small heap of stars" in his 1/2-inch refractor.  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" (f/13) Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.

In the 13.1", roughly three dozen stars are visible in a 10' field.  The bright stars are scattered mostly on the following side of the group in an elongated arrangement extending to the southeast.  There is also a fairly rich gathering of stars within 4' of HX Vel.  NGC 2660 is located 48' S.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered IC 2395 = Lac. III-3 between 1751-1752 during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded "Star of 6th magnitude, connected to another more southern one by a nebulous trail."  Solon Bailey independently discovered the cluster photographically in 1896 with a 1" Cook lens at the Arequipa station in Peru.  The discovery was published in his 1908 paper "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae, Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII.  Dreyer missed Lacaille earlier discovery and Bailey is credited in the IC.


Brent Archinal noted the equivalence of this cluster with vdB-Ha 47.  The Lynga position for IC 2395 is incorrect but OK for vdB-Ha 47.  Brian Skiff gives a centroid position of 08 42 31 -48 06.5 (2000).

Ralph Copeland discovered IC 2411 on 26 Dec 1873 with LdR's 72-inch telescope and noted "cF, pS, lE pf; was thought to have an eF companion about 2' nf."  Dreyer followed this up on 21 Feb 1876, saying, "eF; I think it is only a * 16 m +- nf."  Because of his uncertainty Dreyer didn't assign this galaxy an IC designation.


Max Wolf discovered it again on a Heidelberg plate on 13 Jan 1901 and assumed it was new.  Dreyer catalogued it as IC 2411, with no mention of the prior discovery. Corwin notes that "Had Dreyer been observing on a somewhat better night, or (perhaps) with a freshly-polished mirror, the fainter galaxy might also have received an NGC number."

The other two knots are very close west and northwest (LEDA 200245).  A mag 12 star is 1.7' NNE.  The seeing was fairly poor at the time of the observation, so I needed to wait for steady moments to resolve the components.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 2431 = J. 3-1068 on 24 Feb 1896 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory.  His micrometric position is accurate.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2469 = Sw. XI-93 on 28 Dec 1897 and recorded "pF, cS, vE, 10m * close sp."  His RA is 36 seconds too small, but the identification is certain based on his description.  In his 6th Lowe Observatory list in A.J. he made a 10° error in the declination, but it was correct in combined 11th list.  It's surprising that John Herschel missed this relatively large and bright galaxy.

Sir Robert Ball probably discovered IC 2474 = Big. 275 on 10 Jan 1867 using LdR's 72".  He noted "3 objects seen close together, of which one is probably a nebula, the other possibly also, and third a star?  All of these are eF, and would perhaps not be seen unless on so good a night as this is."  The second and third objects are probably IC 2474 and MCG +04-22-060, though Dreyer did not include any additional entries in the NGC because of his uncertainty.  In any case, Bigourdan discovered the galaxy again on 21 Mar 1890 and was credited with the discovery in the IC.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very large, very bright cluster at 84x but fairly scattered.  The most striking portion are two bright ~N-S strings of stars, each ~5' in length, on the SE side of the cluster.  These two strings are connected on the north end by a couple of stars forming a "U" outline.  Many of the other stars are also arranged in strings including streams of stars that extend to the NW on both the north and south side of the cluster.  The most prominent string starts at the northern end of the western row and extends NW to a mag 9.4 star.  The outline of the cluster then meanders south on the west side before heading back SE towards the two parallel strings.  Although the listed diameter is 70', my description applies to the central 15' portion of the cluster.  Located 30' W of mag 3.1 N Velorum.  The irregular planetary, NGC 2899, lies 51' N.

Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered IC 2488 = Lac III-4 = D 330 between 1751-1752 using a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  James Dunlop described D 330 as "A faint cluster of small stars of mixed magnitude, with two or three pretty bright stars in it.  This answers to 485 Argus (Bode) and is described as a small star surrounded by a nebula."  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" f/13 Cook lens at Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII).  As John Herschel never observed the cluster it wasn't included in his GC or the NGC. Dreyer only credited Bailey with the discovery in the IC.

Lewis Swift found IC 2494 = Sw. XI-95 on 20 Feb 1898 and recorded "pB, pL, R, 2 st nr f".  There is nothing at his position but 10 seconds of RA east and 3' south is NGC 2947, which was discovered by Leavenworth in 1886 though his RA was 2 minutes too large.  Javelle also found the galaxy and placed J. 1-165 (later IC 547) accurately.  Howe measured an accurate position for IC 2494 (matching Javelle's) that was adopted in the IC, so Dreyer missed the two IC equivalences.  So, NGC 2947 = IC 547 = IC 2494.

It appeared bright (V = 10.4), very small, slightly elongated, ~8"x6", with a bluish tinge.  Excellent contrast gain with a UHC filter.  Located 58' directly west of NGC 3211 which was viewed immediately afterwards.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): IC 2554 is a remarkable interacting multiple system or a single merger remnant with a tidal tail.   At 260x it consists of what appeared to be a contact pair of edge-ons with just slightly different orientations (both ~SSW-NNE) that run into each other.  The southern portion was brighter and larger, ~1.4'x0.3', while the northern component was perhaps half as long, though they appeared nearly merged so it was difficult to clearly distinguish.  With averted vision, the appearance was even more confusing as there was a strong impression of an additional component or feature in the chain.  NGC 3136B lies 8.3' ENE.  IC 2554 is located 27' NE of NGC 3136.

DeLisle Stewart found IC 2555 = D.S. 336 on a plate taken 1 May 1900 at Harvard's Arequipa station and reported "eF, vS, eE at 45°, cbM."  His position matches NGC 3157 = ESO 435-051.  This galaxy was discovered by John Herschel in 1835 and accurately placed in his Cape of Good Hope catalogue, but the position in the GC and NGC is 40' too far north.  As a result Stewart thought it was new, but NGC 3157 = IC 2555.

18" (4/10/04): fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 1.4'x0.8', moderate concentration with a small brighter core and much fainter extensions.  Nestled within a neat asterism of 5 stars forming a rough rectangle including two mag 12 stars 1.3' NE and 1.9' ENE of center.  This Seyfert galaxy (type 2) is a possible outlying member of the Antlia Cluster (ACO S636).


Lewis Swift discovered IC 2560 = Sw. XI-106 on 28 Dec 1897 and reported "eeF; pS; iR; in center of trapezium."  His RA is 30 seconds too small, but the identification is certain based on the description.  Howe measured a more accurate position in 1899 or 1900, though it was still 1' too far north.

There is nothing at his position but 28 seconds of RA east is NGC 3223 and his description applies.  Herbert Howe followed up on Swift's observation, measured an accurate position (Monthly Notices, Nov. 1900), and noted the mag 9 star follows by 9 sec.  John Herschel discovered this galaxy in 1835 and measured a fairly accurate position, so the equivalence NGC 3223 = IC 2571 is certain.

48" (2/21/12): This large, low surface brightness dwarf irregular in the M81 group extended roughly 10'x4' SW-NE with only a weak, broad concentration.  The galaxy is dominated by a giant star forming/HII complex near the NE end of the galaxy.  At 375x, four separate, compact knots were easily resolved within a 1.2' region, though the brighter glow from the entire complex spans roughly 1.5'x1.0' from WSW to ENE.  The brightest and largest knot carries the designation IC 2574:[HK83] #15, from Hodge and Kennicutt's "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 Galaxies" in AJ, 88, 296 (1983).  This high surface brightness knot is very bright, slightly elongated N-S, 20"x15", and is situated at the NW vertex of the four knots.  #13/34 is a fainter irregular knot of ~12" diameter at the NE vertex.  #35 forms the SE vertex and appears as a faint, round knot, only 8"-10" in size, just 24" SSW of #13/#34.  The knot at the SW vertex is not listed in the H-K atlas, but is catalogued in NED as radio source NVSS J102844+682809.  It appeared similar to #35, though slightly elongated and situated only 20" S of #15.  At 488x, a 5th knot was seen ~30" SW of #15, and appeared as a very faint, ill-defined 15" glow (this region contains #17 and #19).


17.5" (3/12/94): faint, very large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 7.0'x2.5', low surface brightness, no concentration.  Four faint stars are near the north side.  There is a fairly bright nonstellar HII region that is clearly visible at the NE end as a high surface brightness knot.  Member of the M81 group  (distance ~12 million l.y.).


Edwin Coddington discovered IC 2574 at Lick Observatory on a plate of the M81/82 region taken on 17 and 20 Apr 1898 with the 6" Crocker telescope (Willard Lens). The discovery was announced in PASP 10, 123 (1898).  Coddington noted he observed it visually on the 22nd with the 12-inch refractor.  Also, on 19 May, Coddington obtained an additional photograph that showed "the different condensations to be connected by faint nebulous matter, and the whole to extend over an area fully 4' in width and 12' in length."

This galaxy is almost certainly NGC 3271, discovered by John Herschel in 1834 and recorded as "F; S; lE; bM; 15"; one of a group of 3 or more."  Herschel's RA was 25 seconds too small, so Stewart apparently assumed it was new.  The numbers are equated in ESO and Corwin's Southern Galaxy Catalogue.  Based on plates taken at the Helwan Observatory in 1919-20, IC 2585 was assumed to be LEDA 83144, a very faint edge-on 3.8' E of NGC 3271.

Located just 1.7' S of mag 6.1 HD 91805 and the combination of low elevation and the glare of the bright star severely hampered viewing the galaxy.  At 225x I was able to place the star just outside the edge of the field which increased the visibility.  This galaxy is located 1.3° ENE of NGC 3256 and is probably part of the southern group Klemola 12 (NGC 3256, 3256B, 3261, 3262 and 3263 were observed from Costa Rica).

This is the brightest member of HCG 48 along with HCG 48B 2.5' S and HCG 48C 2.0' NW.  This HCG is actually a subgroup of AGC 1060 whose core is located just 30' SSW.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2597 on 13 May 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  With respect to 5th magnitude HD 92036, he noted "20' N and 5' f, not large, not faint."  Barnard didn't measure an accurate position or publish his discovery so did not receive credit in the IC.  Swift rediscovered IC 2597 on 14 Feb 1898 and recorded Sw. XI-114 (later IC 2597) as "pB; pS; D* nr p." The last comment may refer to a star and HCG 48C.  In a note, Swift added "This is not one of Sir John Herschel's 9 [in the Hydra I cluster].  I have another near [HCG 48B?]; stellar."  Harold Knox-Shaw listed IC 2597 in a table of new nebulae (1912) found using the 30" Reynolds reflector between 1909-11 at the Helwan Observatory.  Probably this was due to Swift's poor position or description.

IC 2599 = ESO 128-006 = Gum 31 = Ced 108 = part of Gabriela Mistral Nebula

10 37 27.1 -58 44 00; Car


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I only took a quick look at the "Gabriela Mistral" Nebula nebula at 200x and a UHC filter, but the brightest portion appeared like a cartoon drawing of a whale with a huge, very bright bulbous "head" forming the northern end of the nebula.  The brightest portion is perhaps 15'x6' in size, but quite an extensive amount of fainter nebulosity spreads out the east and southeast of the main body, significantly increasing the size to ~15'x11', elongated N-S.  Some faint nebulosity also spreads to the west of the main portion.  At the south end is the mag 5.5 star HD 92207.


13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): striking HII region and cluster 30' SE of NGC 3293 and 90' NW of the center of the Eta Carina nebula! (this is an outlying piece of the Eta Carina complex)  At 105x and UHC filter this huge, elongated, irregular nebula is quite bright, perhaps 15'x6' in size and tapers towards the south end where mag 5.5 HD 92207 is embedded.  The nebula widens to a well-defined bulbous mass on the north end.  Faint nebulosity hooks off the north end and spreads to the east and northeast.  This HII region is ionized by mag 8 HD 92206 = h4338 (an 8.2/9.2 pair at 5") situated near the center of the nebula.  Unfiltered, a scattered group of stars is superimposed but this just appears to be a random star grouping in the Carina section of the Milky Way.


Williamina Fleming found IC 2599 = southern part of NGC 3324 on a plate taken in May 1893 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  In Annals of Harvard College Observatory, vol. 26, page 207, Pickering mentions it surrounds AGC 14525 (SAO 238271) and "has not received a number in Dreyer's catalog".  But NGC 3324 (as described by John Herschel) extends as far as that star.  So, IC 2599 is really part of NGC 3324.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): with the naked-eye, an obvious halo is visible around mag 2.7 Theta Carinae but only a few stars are resolved naked eye.  In the 9x50mm finder, a couple of dozen stars are resolved in a 1° region.  The "Southern Pleiades" is too large and too scattered for an impressive view in the 13".  The cluster includes about a dozen mag 6-7.5 stars scattered in the field and a couple of mag 5 stars, along with blue-colored Theta (B-V = -0.2), a well known Blue Straggler.  Most of the bright stars are located in two main groups; a 45' string extending north and southwest of Theta and a large, detached, rectangular group of stars on the east end of the cluster, roughly 25' from Theta.  Melotte 101 lies 40' SSW and is described below.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): very bright naked-eye cluster visible as a bloated glow around Theta Carinae.  Gorgeous in 30mm binoculars with at least three dozen stars resolved at only 10x.


Melotte 101

14.5" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 73x and 147x): beautiful, very large cluster, centered 12' E of a mag 5.5 star.  Roughly 120-150 stars are resolved, depending on the assumed size. There is no distinct boundary so the size is pretty arbitrary but most of the brighter stars are within a 8'-10' circle.  Many of the stars are arranged in long chains and loops.  The brightest mag 9.7 star is at the west end, but the majority of the stars are 12-13 magnitude.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered IC 2602 = Lac II-9 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded "The star Theta Navis, of the third magnitude or less, surrounded by a large number of stars of 6th, 7th & 8th magnitude, which resemble the Pleiades."  The nickname "Southern Pleiades derives from this description.  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" (f/13) Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 2605 = Big. 402 on 11 Apr 1899 while observing NGC 3395.  According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan commented, ""Nebulous rounded object, about 20 arcsec across, it would be nearly impossible to make measurements." and estimated an offset of 0.5 seconds of time west and 17" south from the nucleus.  Corwin identifies this with the brighter inner spiral arm just south of the core of the galaxy.


The identification of IC 2605 as part of the arm of NGC 3395 was made by Francis Pease in his 1920 paper on descriptions of nebulae photographed with the 60-inch at Mt. Wilson.

48" (4/20/17): fairly bright, fairly large, asymmetric face-on spiral.  IC 2627 has a very lopsided appearance with one long, prominent arm and a second arm that is shorter and less contrasty.  The central section consisted of a bright, oval core highlighted by a stellar nucleus.  A strong, knotty arm emerged on the southeast side of the core and gracefully unfurled counterclockwise towards the west on the south side.  It significantly faded just east of a mag 16 star [50" WSW of center].  With averted vision, though, the arm could be followed about 1' further north of this star, but the surface brightness was extremely low.  The second arm was more subtle and seemed detached from the core.  It extended E-W, ~30" length, on the north side of the core and displayed a sharp northern edge.  Several mag 16.5 stars were superimposed or nearby.


18" (3/29/03): fairly large, but fairly faint roundish glow.  The surface brightness was irregular at 300x with a patchy appearance (face-on spiral with an asymmetrically brighter arm and knotty appearance on the DSS).  Located 8.4' ESE of mag 9.9 SAO 179590.


Lewis Swift discovered IC 2627 = Sw. XI-120 on 10 Apr 1898 and reported "eF; L; R; sev st in L semi circle n, in finder field with Beta Crateris."  Herbert Howe noted it has "a stellar nucleus of mag 13.5."  This was discovered in the last couple of months of Swift's observing career.

Size 10'


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): surprisingly bright, very large reflection nebula surrounding the mag 9.0 pre-main-sequence star HD 97300 (Herbig Ae/Be dwarf).  The nebula extended nearly 8' in diameter (fading out around the edges) and appeared essentially round.  It was missed by John Herschel although he picked up NGC 3620, a faint galaxy 32' NE.  IC 2631 is not plotted in Tirion's Sky Atlas 2000, Uranometria 2000 (both 1st and 2nd editions), nor the Millennium Star Atlas.


Several star fields to the south of IC 2631 were strangely devoid of stars due to the huge molecular Chamaeleon Dark Cloud.  Only a few brighter stars were visible in the 30' field at 200x (13mm Ethos).  The center is roughly 40' S of IC 2631 and the dark cloud appears elongated 2:1, roughly 90'x45' N-S.


The Chamaeleon dark cloud complex is a complicated structure consisting of 3 large molecular clouds (designated Cha I, II, III by Hoffmeister 1963) and a number of smaller clumps and globules.  The region I observed corresponds with Cha I and contains the reflection nebula Ced 110 = GN 11.04.8 and Ced 111 (surrrounding T Tauri stars HD 97048 = CU Cha and DI Cha).

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was a surprisingly appealing cluster, roughly 13' in diameter and framed nicely in the 30' field at 200x in the 13mm Ethos.  The stars are fairly uniform in brightness with a large number of mag 11-12.5 stars and they give the impression of being connected in numerous loops and chains over the entire cluster.  The cluster is not concentrated, though there are several mag 11 stars near the center and a close double.  Mel 105 is located 48' SSE.


James Dunlop discovered IC 2714 = D 281 on 27 Apr 1826 (first night he recorded objects) with his 9-inch reflector at Parramatta, NSW.  He described a "cluster of very small stars, a little elongated preceding and following, about 10' diameter; the stars are congregated towards the centre, a pretty bright star south, and a double star south following this."  His position was ~7' too far north, within  his usual erros.


Solon Bailey independently discovered the cluster in 1896 on a photographic plate using a 1-inch f/13 Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.  His description reads "cluster, pretty compressed."   In 1927, Harry Wood reported that based on a Franklin-Adams plate, the cluster doesn't agree in appearance with Bailey's description.  "This cluster is an open large cluster (12' in diameter) and is the same magnitude and is of the () Carinae type.  It lies immediately north of CPD -62 1953."  In the same note he described nearby cluster Cr 246.

As a result Javelle assumed it was new, although Rudolph Spitaler corrected the RA in 1891 at the Wein Observatory.  So, IC 2959 = NGC 3871.

Lewis Swift found IC 2965 = Sw. XI-124 on 20 Feb 1898 and reported "B, S, eE, a ray."  There is nothing at his position, but 3.5 minutes of time east (same declination) is NGC 3957 and the description fits.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 3957 = IC 2965, the only plausible candidate he could find.

Size 3'x2'


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly faint, fairly large elongated glow surrounding a 43" pair of stars oriented E-W (viewed unfiltered).  This reflection nebula extends at least 2'x1' and perhaps 2.5'x1.25'.  Located 22' NW of mag 4.9 HD 103079 (close double COO 130 = 5.2/7.4 at 1.6").


Royal H. Frost discovered IC 2966 = F. 791 = D 266? on a photographic plate taken  5 May 1904 with the 24-inch refractor at the Arequipa station.  It's possible that James Dunlop discovered it earlier on 8 May 1826 and recorded "A very small nebula, very bright immediately at the center; the bright point is nearly equal in brightness to one of the minute stars north of the nebula.  I do not think the bright point is a star, but a very high condensed nucleus, surrounded by a faint chevelure, not more than 10" diameter.  Another very minute nebula precedes it."  Dunlop's position is 16' NW of IC 2966 and it may be too faint to have been picked up in his 9-inch speculum reflector (equivalent to a 6" or so), so this identification is uncertain.


Van den Bergh and Herbst included this object as No. 56 in their Catalogue of Southern Stars Embedded in Nebulosity (AJ, 1975), noting that it had a high surface brightness and was equally bright on both the red and blue plates. The maximum diameter on the red plate was 2.4' and the blue plate was 2.6'.

Hermann Kobold discovered IC 2968 on 2 Apr 1894 with the 18-inch refractor at the Strasbourg Observatory. The CGCG and UGC notes to NGC 3937 misidentify this galaxy as IC 2958.  Harold Corwin notes that RNGC, UGC, NGC 2000.0, and PGC all incorrectly equate IC 2968 with NGC 3937.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2969 = Sw. XI-125 on 4 May 1897 and recorded "eF; pS; R; B * f[ollows] 55 sec; np of 2."  There is nothing at his position but 8.6' S is MCG -01-30-040.  The bright star is mag 8.2 HD 103252 and the galaxy southeast is Swift's IC 2972 (identical to NGC 3952).

Lewis Swift found IC 2972 = Sw. XI-127 on 23 Mar 1895 at Lowe Observatory and reported "vF; pS; R; 2 B stars n and np; s of 2 [with IC 2969]."  His position is just 1.2' N of NGC 3952 and the description of the nearby stars matches.  This galaxy was discovered by William Herschel on 11 Mar 1787 and his position has a comparable accuracy, so its surprising that neither Swift nor Dreyer noticed the equivalence.

Lewis Swift found IC 2976 = Sw. XI-129 on 23 May 1897 and reported "vF; vS; R; vF * near nf."  There is nothing at his position but 1.5 minutes of RA east is NGC 3979 and the star close northeast clinches this identification.  Swift also found this galaxy in 1886, but the original discovery goes to Edward Holden in 1881.

17.5" (2/24/90): very faint, very small, slightly elongated N-S, even surface brightness.  Located 3' SE of mag 8.0 SAO 62767.  Picked up viewing the NGC 3955 group with NGC 3986 8' S and NGC 3966 15' WNW.  Verified on the POSS.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 2979 = J. 3-1201, along with IC 2981, on 12 Jun 1896.  There is nothing at the IC position, but Harold Corwin and Malcolm Thomson found that Javelle made a 1 degree error in the north polar distance of his offset star.  Once corrected, his position fits UGC 6925 perfectly.  Due to this error, modern catalogues fail to identify their equivalent entries as IC 2979.  NED and HyperLeda now use the IC designation.

17.5" (2/24/90): very faint, very small, round.  Two mag 13/14 stars are 1.3' W.  Member of the NGC 3995 group.  Incorrectly identified as NGC 3966 in modern sources.


Stephane Javelle discovered IC 2981 = J. 3-1202, along with IC 2979, on 12 Jun 1896.   He used the same comparison star (BD +33 2172) for IC 2979 for which there was a one degree error its north polar distance, but after making this correction there is nothing at the position for IC 2981.  None of the major galaxy catalogues include a listing for IC 2981 except for MOL (Master Optical List) and NGC 2000 (at the incorrect IC declination).  However, Corwin found that reversing the sign of the RA offset points directly at CGCG 157-056 = PGC 37462.  This identification is given here.


To further confuse the issue, PGC 37462 is misidentified as NGC 3966 in RNGC, MCG, CGCG and PGC.  Max Wolf suggested that Heinrich d'Arrest's single position was 30 seconds off in RA.  His "corrected" position is given in the IC 2 Notes and matches PGC 37462.  But Harold Corwin (e-mail from 3/6/98) found that d'Arrest's description did not match this galaxy, particularly the nearby mag 12-13 star.  d'Arrest mentions he was searching for h1027 = NGC 3986, and this galaxy matches his description of the nearby star!  So, despite a poor match in RA and Dec, NGC 3966 = NGC 3986, instead.

17.5" (4/9/99): faint, very small, elongated 20"x15" SW-NE.  Just follows a mag 11 star [45" to center] which is the brightest star in an inverted "L" asterism and which detracts from viewing.  Located 3.1' W of NGC 4004 and 6.0' W of NGC 3988.


J.L.E. Dreyer probably discovered IC 2982 = Big. 285 = NGC 4004B on 5 Apr 1877.  A sketch reproduced in the 1880 LdR Monograph shows GC 2633 [later NGC 3988] and a second nebula close following a star.  Dreyer assumed this was GC 2645 [later NGC 4004], but the placement with respect to the included stars matches IC 2982.


Guillaume Bigourdan "officially" discovered IC 2982 again on 28 Apr 1894.  The IC position is 3' too far south but Corwin's re-reduced position is a good match and his description fits.  Bigourdan is credited with the discovery in the IC.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 2989 = Big. 287 on 29 Mar 1895.  This was the third discovery of NGC 4139 = CGCG 013-061 = PGC 38213.  Heinrich d'Arrest first discovered this galaxy in 1863, but made a 5 minute error in RA.  David Todd rediscovered the galaxy on 6 Jan 1878 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet.  As there nothing at the NGC position, Dorothy Carlson and the RNGC classified NGC 4139 as nonexistent.  CGCG labels this galaxy as IC 2989.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2995 = Sw. XI-131 on 30 Dec 1897 and noted "vF; L; cE; 8m * near f[ollowing]; np of 2 [with Sw. XI-133]."  The second entry was actually observed 2 nights later, so he may have added the comment "np of 2" when preparing his manuscript.  Howe observed the field in 1899-00 and reported, "These were discovered on different nights; their positions agree closely, and their descriptions fairly.  I examined the locality on two nights, and found only one nebula, which is elongated at 120°, is about 1.5' long, and points toward a star of mag 9, which follows 15 or 20 seconds."  So, Sw. XI-133 is a duplicate entry for IC 2995.


DeLisle Stewart found this galaxy again on an Arequipa plate in 1899, measured the position, and noted "F, cL, ellip. sp form, E at 125°."  In 1921 it was described at the Helwan Observatory as  "F, 3' x 1', E 115°; irr. spiral; the south-following portion is probably absorbed."
