Lawrence Parsons discovered NGC 4000 on 25 Apr 1878 during one of the six Birr Castle observations of the cluster.  Parsons placed this nebula at 100.5" separation in PA 283.9° (WNW) with respect to mag 8 star HD 103913 and described it as "vF, vS, lE ns, gbM." The micrometric offset points directly to UGC 6949.

Otto Struve found NGC 4005 on 16 Mar 1869 with the 15-inch refractor at Pulkovo Observatory while searching for Comet Winnecke (7P/Pons-Winnecke) in Mar-Apr 1869.


WH discovered this galaxy and catalogued it as H III-325 (later NGC 4007), but the declination in the GC and NGC is 2 degrees too far south due to a copying or reduction error (Auwer's reduction has the correct position).  This correction was noted by Dreyer in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of WH."  Because of Struve's unambiguous position, this galaxy is identified as NGC 4005 in UGC, CGCG, MCG, RNGC, RC3 but by historical precedence, NGC 4007 should be the primary designation.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4007 = H III-325 on 6 Apr 1785 (sweep 393) and noted "eF, vS."  His position (Auwer's reduction) is just 1' east of UGC 6952 = PGC 37661, but the North Polar Distance in GC and NGC is two degrees too far south (the offset is 45' south of 4 Comae).  This error was caught and corrected by Dreyer in his 1912 revision of WH's catalogues.  Otto Struve independently found the galaxy on 16 Mar 1869 and Dreyer himself picked it up at Birr Castle in 1878 (labeled as Alpha on the diagram of the cluster), and it was catalogued as NGC 4005 at the correct position.


All major catalogues identify this galaxy as NGC 4005 although you could argue that by prior discovery, H III-325 = NGC 4007 should take historical precedence.  In any case, it is clear that NGC 4005 = NGC 4007.  Unfortunately, as a result of the two degree error, the NGC position falls close to NGC 4003.  So, Karl Reinmuth in his 1926 survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", Dorothy Carlson's NGC/IC Correction list, CGCG, UGC, MCG all misidentify NGC 4007 = NGC 4003, ignoring Dreyer's correction.  See Malcolm Thomson's Catalogue Corrections and Corwin's notes.

The galaxy bulges towards center but is only weakly concentrated, fades towards tips.  On the DSS the star is superimposed on a thin equatorial dust lane that was not seen.  Member of the NGC 4111 group in the UMa cloud.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4013 = H II-733 = h1041 on 6 Feb 1788 (sweep 810) and recorded "pB, mE, about 4' long and 3/4' br.  A pBSN and vF branches near the meridian." JH made two observations and logged on sweep 248 "B; mE; vsvmbM to a * = 10-11m; pos of extension = 62.3° by measure."

17.5" (3/19/88): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated bright core.  First of three with NGC 4021 5' NE and NGC 4023 6' SE.  Located close to the Coma Berenices-Leo border within the NGC 4007 group.  This is a double galaxy but the companion on the north side was not seen.


J.L.E. Dreyer discovered NGC 4015 (along with NGC 4021 and 4023) on 24 Apr 1878 and described it as "F, vS, E pf, mbM."  With respect to NGC 4005, he placed it at a separation of 545.1" in PA 124.9° and it was labeled "Beta" on the constructed sketch of the cluster.  At this exact separation is Arp 138 = VV 216 = UGC 6965.  The summary table questions if this nebula is H III-323, but this Herschel number applies to NGC 3987.  The next night Lawrence Parsons (4th Earl of Rosse) commented "Beta has a tail n[orth] of nucleus."  The "tail" refers to the northern component (VV 216b = MCG +04-28-110) of the double system, which did not receive a separate NGC designation.


The PGC positions for the two components, PGC 37702 and 37703, are nearly identical, though the dimensions (0.9?x0.2?) and magnitude (15.6) of PGC 37702 apparently apply to the edge-on.  HyperLEDA assigns the PGC designation in order or RA, which puts the label PGC 37703 on the edge-on, while NED assigns PGC 37702 to the edge-on.

Contains a brighter elongated bar through the center oriented ~E-W with a slightly brighter, very small nucleus.  The halo changed shape and size with averted version so I was probably picking up part of the spiral arms that extend north on the west side and south on the east side.

It brightened somewhat in the center to a rounder nucleus.  Two very easy, graceful spiral arms were visible; the eastern arm is a bit brighter and knotty (HII regions) near its root on the southeast side of the core.  It rotates clockwise, bending north on the east side of the galaxy and then curls towards to the west, ending nearly due north of the core.  The western arm was also easily seen as an extension south-southeast, while tapering and fading to the south of the core.  Forms a striking pair with NGC 4016 6' NW.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4017 = H II-369 = h1043 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and noted "F, E, pL.  The following part the brightest."  CH's reduction matches this barred spiral.  JH made three observations, although all positions are rough.


Six observations were made at Birr Castle.  On 30 Mar 1854, R.J. Mitchell noted "F, spiral?  Another vF neb [NGC 4016] about 5' np or nearly north."  The following spring he commented "Query, shaped like an "S"?  Its light is certainly patchy and the neb is lE nearly pf.  np this object is another F, R neb with stellar centre."  Finally on 16 Apr 1855, he wrote "my previous conjectoure as to shape is rather confirmed by Mr. Johnstone Stoney [on a visit between professorial duties], who saw the p branch turned off sharply to the south, while the f bend is not so sharp, but this latter branch reacher farther round and is rather fainter."

John Herschel discovered NGC 4019 = h1044 on 23 Apr 1832 (the last night he made a discovery at Slough, setting sail for the Cape of Good Hope the following year) and logged, "eF; has a *9m 5' sf".  There is nothing near his position.  A mag 15 star is 3.5' northwest of his position and a mag 10 star lies 6' southeast of this faint star (a good match with his description), so the faint star is one possible candidate for NGC 4019.


Harold Corwin identifies NGC 4019 as IC 755, an edge-on galaxy 2 min 16 sec of RA east and 6' south of JH's position.  It has a mag 10 star 5.5' southeast that matches his description, but it unusually off in both RA and Dec.  So, this identification is uncertain.

Update: Corwin checked JH's sweep records and it appears his offsets refer to Beta Leonis.  Rereducing yields a position 2 minutes of RA further east, which is within 20 seconds of RA within IC 755.  Hence the equivalnce is very likely.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x this is a strange looking one-armed spiral.  Overall it appeared quite bright and large with a very irregular shape, 3'x2', and sharply concentrated with a fairly small, round core.  The core gradually increased to the center.  Emerging from the core on the NW end is a fairly well-defined arm that initially extends north in the direction of a mag 11.8 star located 3.7' NNW of the center of the galaxy.  This arm then sharply curves counter-clockwise ~135°, bending around to the N and NE, ending just outside a mag 14 star situated close NE of the core.  On the SE end of the core, a second arm begins to emerge but it suddenly terminates, creating a very asymmetric appearance with one long, wrapping arm.


A faint companion, NGC 4027A, lies 4' S.  At 260x, this galaxy appeared faint, fairly small, slightly elongated ~N-S, 25"x20", low even surface brightness.  A very faint star is attached at the south end.  The Antennae galaxy, NGC 4038/4039, lies 40' NE.


48" (2/28/19): at 488x; the spectacular spiral arm on the north side of the galaxy wrapped around over 180° and faded out beyond a 14th mag star, nearly due east of the core of the galaxy.  The core of the galaxy was roundish but contained a brighter bar oriented E-W.  There was a darker region just south of the core, due to dust.  NGC 4027A, situated 4' S, appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated N-S, irregular, fairly low even surface brightness.  An extremely faint star is at the southeast edge.


13.1" (2/16/85): fairly bright, round, moderately large, broad concentration, possible stellar nucleus.  A mag 14 star is off the ENE edge 1.0' from center.  NGC 4027 is an unusual interacting one-armed barred spiral.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4027 = H II-296 = h3371 on 7 Feb 1785 (sweep 386) and logged "pB, pL."  His RA was 1.0 minute of time too large.  John Herschel made an interesting description from the Cape of Good Hope: "Globular; F; pL; R; 2'; resolved; stars barely seen; but in a better night for definition would no doubt be clearly resolved into st 16m."  His position is accurate, though of course his description isn't valid. It was described as a single branched spiral with condensations in the Helwan Observatory bulletin for 1921, based on photos taken by Knox-Shaw in 1914-16 with the 30" reflector.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4028 = H III-3 on 30 Dec 178 (sweep 72) and recorded "vF, not cometic tho' almost round.  It forms an isosceles triangle with 2 small stars [by a diagram these are about 6' sp].  It is probably of the resolvable kind but eF; it may be a very distant compressed cl of stars, but would require a great quantity of light to resolve."  There is nothing at his position (an early sweep prone to large errors) and III-3 was not found visually by Bigourdan or photographically by Reinmuth.


Harold Corwin equates NGC 4028 with NGC 4014, which matches WH's description of forming an isosceles triangle with two stars (6' sp and 6' np).  He notes this would require WH made offset errors on two different sweeps landing roughly at the same erroneous position.

82" (5/4/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; I was surprised to see the numerous high surface brightness knots lining the rim of NGC 4038 and the looping spiral arm on the east side. A total of 17 knots were counted; these were irregularly spread out with several in clumps.  The beginning of the spiral arm extending south was very noticeable exiting the eyepiece field.


48" (4/1/11 and 5/3/19): I took a quick look at the Antennae Galaxy on 4/1/11 to see the faint tidal tails that shoot north and south from the east end of NGC 4038/4039.  The tidal tail heading south from NGC 4038 (the northern component) was easily visible, sweeping 2' S but then quickly dimming.  The streamer heading north was also visible but appeared detached from the galaxies.  It was picked up ~2.5' NE of NGC 4038 and extended 2' N, terminating at a faint star.


On 5/3/19 we examined the galaxy using a NPB filter at 375x.  Overall the galaxy dimmed but a ring of HII knots extending 270° seemed to light up, providing a striking appearance!  They appeared to brighten and dim as individual knots "turned on" with averted vision and gave the impression of viewing car headlights through different layers of fog.


24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was an amazing object in the 24" at 350x.  The main, bright northern component (NGC 4038) was partially annular, with a very bright knotty rim and a darker center giving a truly unique appearance for a galaxy.  At least 3 knots were visible embedded along its rim.  On the SE side is the brightest knot (the nucleus of the galaxy) which appeared faint, small, ~12" diameter.  A second fainter knot is on the west side and was only ~6" in size.  Finally, a third very faint 6" knot is on the north side.  The three knots were roughly spaced out 120° apart along the outer portion of this tortured galaxy.  An elongated "arm" (the interacting companion NGC 4039) is attached on the east end and curves around on the south side towards the southwest.  Another very faint, but slightly larger 20" knot is embedded along the main portion of NGC 4039, roughly halfway along its length.  At the southwest tip of the brighter portion of NGC 4039 was a relatively large, brighter knot (its nucleus) that at times appeared double.  Surrounding the southwest portion of NGC 4039 is a much fainter outer halo extended SW-NE.  This fainter halo extends further southwest for a few arc minutes and widens to a bulbous shape at the end. This was by far the most detailed view I've seen of the Antennae galaxy.  NGC 4027, another disturbed galaxy, lies SW.


17.5" (5/14/88): fairly bright, moderately large.  Forms a striking "shrimp-like" or "comma" shape with the tail attached at the east end and extending to the south.  Appears clearly darker between the two objects on the west side.


13" (5/21/82): appears as two irregular galaxies connected at the east end.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4038 = H IV-28.1 = h1052 on 7 Feb 1785 (sweep 368) and recorded "pB, L.  Two joined together [with NGC 4039], the smallest south; or one opening with a branch very faintly joined."  WH gave a single entry in class IV (planetary), though John Herschel separated these into IV 28.1 and IV 28.2 in the Slough catalogue.  Bindon Stoney sketched the galaxy pair on 14 Apr 1852 (included in LdR's 1861 publication).  It appears to show one of the long tidal tails.


The long "Antennae" tidal tails were first photographed by Carl Lampland with the 40-inch Lowell reflector in 1917.  J.C. Duncan remarked "Most remarkable of all, two faint extensions, like antennae" in the 1923 "Photographic studies of nebulae.III."   The Toomre's adopted the nickname "the Antennae" in their early 1972 computer simulation "Galactic Bridges and Tails".

Another very faint, but slightly larger 20" knot is embedded along the main portion of the tail roughly halfway.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 4042 = m 227, along with NGC 4056 and NGC 4060, on 18 Mar 1865 using William Lassell's 48" on Malta.  There is nothing near his position and his description "vF, vS" is not helpful.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 4042 = LEDA 3781394 = 2MASX J12024674+2009478.  This galaxy is located 26 tsec of RA east and 1.8' N of Marth's position.  This offset in declination would also match the offsets for suggested identifications for NGC 4056 and 4060, though NGC 4042 is still further off in terms of RA.  See Corwin's notes.


Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", suggests the possible equivalent with NGC 4032, but this galaxy is 1.8 tmin of RA west and 4' south of Marth's position.  Carlson and RNGC also give this possible equivalence.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4046 on 10 Apr 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His single observation (Latin translation copied from Harold Corwin's notes) reads "round; not small. Class II. It makes a triangle with 2 stars mag 13 and mag 16 to the south and following 6.6 sec.  However, the question remains if it is h1057 [NGC 4045] with a 15' error in declination."   In fact there is nothing at his position, but 15' north is NGC 4045, which matches his description.  The mag 16 "star" is likely NGC 4045A.  So, NGC 4046 = NGC 4045.

48" (5/10/18): at 375x; NGC 4051 is a highly structured S or Z-shaped barred spiral with easy HII knots and subtle details!  This Seyfert galaxy is very sharply concentrated with a brilliant quasi-stellar nucleus!   The bright core extends into a  slightly brighter central region or bar elongated 2:1 NW-SE and just over 1.5' in length.  The halo extends at ~4.5'x3.5' NW-SE.


A very obvious eastern arm is attached at the southeast end of the bar and angles at a 90° angle towards the northeast, pointing towards a mag 14.0 star [2.8' NE of center].  A low surface brightness thin arm [roughly 1.6' in length] angling SE to NW was visible on the north side.  On the DSS this arm appears to emanate from the bright eastern arm though visually it appeared straight and completely detached.


A large knotty arm, attached at the northwest end, bends sharply towards the south. This arm is thick or wide at its root with a large brighter knot or region embedded (catalogued as [EKS96] #31 and #28 in the 1996 "Atlas of HII Regions in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies").  As the arm dips south it terminates at a faint 10" knot (#10), 1.4' W of center.  In addition, an obvious, small bright knot (#52), ~8" diameter, is just south of the core [by 0.6'].  This knot resides in a very thin arm (not seen) just south of the central region. Overall, I was very impressed with this gorgeous galaxy!


17.5" (3/8/97): fairly bright, large, ~4.0'x2.5' NW-SE.  Nearly extends to a mag 11 star 2.2' W.  Very bright, very small core increasing to a bright stellar nucleus (original Seyfert galaxy list).  The galaxy shows signs of spiral structure and there appears to be a short outer spiral arm attached at the SE end hooking north separated by a slightly darker region between the main body (verified on photo).  This galaxy, along with NGC 3938 and NGC 4111, are the brightest members of the NGC 4111 group (LGG 269) in the UMa Cloud.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4051 = H IV-56 = h1061 on 6 Feb 1788 (sweep 810) and recorded "cB, iR, cBN with extensive chevelure about 5' dia."  His position matches UGC 7030.


Bindon Stoney sketched the galaxy on 3 May 1851 as an "S" shaped barred spiral (in LdR's 1861 publication). He captured the structure very accurately and noted, "Spiral.  I suspect the f branch extends to [star] alpha [on the northeast end]."  On 19 Apr 1857, R.J. Mitchell logged "The p branch seems to me the brighter rather of the two, and more suddenly curved than the f one, both of them look not quite so sharp as given in the drawing."


NGC 4051 is one of the original 6 galaxies studied by Seyfert in his seminal 1943 paper "Nuclear Emission in Spiral Nebulae".

Marth's position is 3 tsec of RA west and 2.3' south of CGCG 128-006 = PGC 38151 and this is the identification adopted in RNGC, CGCG and by Corwin.


It is also possible that NGC 4060 = PGC 38140.  This galaxy is identified as NGC 4056 in the RNGC.  PGC 38140 is only 0.6' N of Marth's position, though it is noticeably fainter visually and that would leave no other candidate for Marth's NGC 4056.

The times and numbers belong to the three first [III-391, III-392 and III-393]; but I saw three more [10 or 12'] south of them.  They were are all vF, vS."  I suspected many more besides."  The three nebulae which he did not measure positions, are likely NGC 4061, NGC 4065, and NGC 4076 (the three brightest).  John Herschel observed NGC 4061 on 3 sweeps and logged on 25 Mar 1830 (sweep 244), "vF; a double neb by diag, pos 20° sp, nearly equal.  They run together."


NGC 4055 = h1062, recorded by JH on 29 Apr 1832 (the same night he logged NGC 4057 = h1063 and NGC 4059 = h1064) is very likely a duplicate observation.  See that number for more.

According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan misidentified a star as NGC 4068 on two nights and "rediscovered" the galaxy on 11 Mar 1886, though made an error in his position, and Big. 166 (later IC 757) is identical to NGC 4068.

John Herschel discovered NGC 4069 = h1070 on 24 Feb 1827 and described as "vF, R, 4th of 5; has another on same meridian, north".  This is one of the very faint galaxies near NGC 4066 and was not seen by his father, although JH equated h1070 with WH's III 392.  JH's position (single sweep) is 6 seconds of RA east of PGC 38166, a galaxy which is likely too faint to have been swept up.  If NGC 4069 = PGC 38166, then the nebula "on the same meridian, north" would refer to NGC 4066.  But then why did he miss NGC 4060 = CGCG 128-006, which is just 1.5' NW? See Harold Corwin's discussion in his identification notes.  Courtney Seligman classified NGC 4069 as a "lost or nonexistent object, commonly misidentified as PGC 38166."

18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I had a difficult time ferreting out this faint PN that is buried within a very rich Milky Way field.  It was finally picked up at 76x (27 Panoptic) and OIII filter as a faint, round disc at least 40" in diameter.  Removing the filter, a faint star was superimposed on the SW side of a low surface brightness glow.  Also viewed unfiltered at 228x which showed the faint star and the disc more easily, though this is quite faint for NGC planetary.  The best view was at 128x using an OIII filter, although NGC 4071 has a low-excitation level.  The disc appeared fairly faint with subtle irregularities in surface brightness and was likely brighter along portions of the rim.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4071 = h3374 on 4 Mar 1835 and recorded "vF; R; 40"; has a vS star in centre; in a field of at least 80 or 90 stars."  His position is accurate.  The "vS star" he mentions might be the one on the southwest side.

All objects were assigned NGC + letter designations based on the nearest NGC object on the plate.  His description reads, "13.8m; 1.2'x0.3' in PA 132°; Sa."

A mag 10 star 5' SSW has two faint companions (RST 2777); a close mag 13 star at 1.8" and a wider 12" companion.  I'm surprised that neither one of the Herschels noted this interesting unequal triple.  Several brighter stars are scattered in the field.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4087 = H III-754 = h3375 on 24 Feb 1789 (sweep 911) and logged "Suspected, eF, too low to be verified, but I have not much doubt." John Herschel made an observation on 22 Mar 1836 (sweep 689) from the Cape of Good Hope and recorded "pB; R; gbM."  Lewis Swift found it again on 11 Apr 1898 and included in his large 11th discovery list (#132) at Lowe Observatory.  Howe reported Sw. XI-132, "this must be identical with 4087, since both are pretty bright, and their places agree within three seconds in right ascension and 1' in declination." As a result, Dreyer didn't assign a duplicate IC designation.

48" (4/4/11): this is a showpiece spiral in the 48-inch with the startling eyepiece view matching the detail in the DSS image.  The galaxy extended 5.5'x2.0' SW-NE.  Near the center is an elongated, extremely bright core.  The very bright central portion extends from the core in a roughly 2'x0.5' region towards the southwest but is concave a bit, bending slightly towards the south.  This feature appears similar to a slightly distorted central bar.  Just south of this central bar is a dust lane extending SW to NE that parallels the bar, though it is more contrasty to the northeast of the core.


The dust lane separates the bright bar feature from a very long arm that extends the entire length of the galaxy along the south side and vaguely emerges from the southwest end of the bar.  This arm is clumpy with a couple of large, bright knots to the south of the core and another prominent knot towards the east end of the galaxy (1.7' NE of the core).  Beyond this knot the arm quickly dims, fans out a bit and bends to the north towards a mag 13.5 star.


Emerging from the northeast end of the core is a second prominent arm that immediately doubles back towards the southwest on the north side.  This arm nearly parallels the central bar to the north and is separated by a less contrasty darker strip or lane.  This clumpy arm contains a fairly prominent knot only 0.6' NW of the core.  After this point the arm dims dramatically continuing a bit further southwest.  The two main arms, along with the central bar create a squashed irregular "Z" appearance.


MCG +09-20-092, which lies 5' SE in the field, appeared faint, small, round, 20" diameter, fairly low even surface brightness.


18" (3/13/10): using 280x this striking, irregular spiral extends 5:2 SW-NE, rougly 5'x2'.  The surface is noticeably mottled and clumpy with a dark patch or dust lane that extends to the south of the core with a weaker darkening to the north of the core.  At the northeast end of the galaxy, a portion of what appears to be a spiral arm emerges from the main body and bends to the north.  A corresponding feature on the SW end of the galaxy, bending south, is much more subtle.


18" (5/3/08): at 280x appeared very bright, large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 4.5'x1.8', contains a bright elongated core.  The galaxy is very asymmetric, with an unusually mottled or clumpy appearance and an irregular outline.  At the NE end is a faint extension (this is a disrupted arm on the DSS) that juts out or dangles from the NE end of the main body and hooks slightly towards a mag 13.5 star located 3.7' NE of center. A more subtle irregular extension is at the SW end.  Just east of the north side of the core the surface brightness drops, either due to a dust lane or large dust patch on the east side of the core and then brightens a bit again just following the dust patch. NGC 4085 lies 11' SSW.  Member of the M109 (NGC 3992) group = LGG 258.


17.5" (4/13/91): bright, fairly large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 5.0'x2.0', mottled patchy appearance, small elongated brighter core but no nucleus.  A mag 15 star is 2' off the NW side.  Faint spiral structure is visible with concentration.  An extremely faint arm is off the NE end curving towards a mag 14.5 star to the NE 3.7' from center and a second extremely faint arm is just visible off the SW end curving to the south.  Forms a pair with NGC 4085 11' SSW.


8" (3/28/81): fairly bright, elongated SW-NE, weak concentration, cigar-shaped.  Forms a pair with NGC 4085 11' SSW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4088 = H I-206 on 9 Mar 1788 (sweep 816) and logged "cF, E, about 4' long."  His summary description from 3 observations reads "cB, E, 45° np sf, 6' long, 4' br, almost equally bright."  Heinrich d'Arrest made 3 observation, the earliest on 4 Dec 1861.


Sir Robert Ball, observing assistant at Birr Castle on 28 Mar 1867, recorded "vB, vL, E 53.5°.  A new spiral with probably many details of interest, of an S shape.  There is certainly a brighter portion sf the nucleus with a dark lane between them.  Likewise, a similar brightness np the nucleus.  I thought the darkness did not extend all round the centre.  There can be little doubt of the curved branch following, it seems to proceed in the direction of a star nf."

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4090, along with NGC 4086, on 2 May 1864.  He mentioned this galaxy in his description for NGC 4086 as 3' to the north but his position is 10 sec of RA too large and 1.3' too far south.

William Herschel found NGC 4099 on 26 Apr 1785 (sweep 402), recording three nebulae described as "Three, time is that of the last [NGC 4098], which is vF and S.  The other two [probably NGC 4092 and 4095] which are south preceding are much fainter and smaller."  John Herschel was confused trying to match his father's three objects with the two he observed and those discovered by d'Arrest.  He attributed the discovery of NGC 4092 to d'Arrest (instead of WH) and assigned III-384 separately to GC 2714 (later NGC 4099).  But III-384 applies to NGC 4098 = h1082 and Dreyer suggests in his 1912 update of WH's catalogues that NGC 4099 "is probably superfluous".  Since this number is a duplicate of one of WH's discovered, I've arbitrarily equated it with NGC 4098 here.

Overall, NGC 4102 is very bright, large, elongated at least 2:1 SSW-NNE, ~2.5'x1.1', very sharply concentrated with a small, intensely bright nucleus surrounded by a bright oval core SW-NE with a bar-like enhancement.  Just outside the core the surface brightness drops significantly forming a darker [dusty] annulus.   Surrounding this is a bright, thick, mottled ring oriented NNW-SSE (slightly offset in orientation from the core).  A brighter knot (SDSS J120625.26+524307.4) is at the NE end of the ring [32" NE of center].  On the SDSS this corresponds with the brightest star cloud in the galaxy and the site of supernova 1975E. A brighter mag 12.5 star is 50" WSW of center, just outside the halo.  When the seeing settled this star resolved into a close pair (~13.2/13.8 at 1.8" separation!)  NGC 4068 lies 23' WSW.  Member of the M109 (NGC 3992) group = LGG 258.


17.5" (5/13/88): fairly bright, moderately large, oval 3:2 SW-NE, small very bright core, stellar nucleus.  A mag 12.5 star is at the west end 48" from the center!


William Herschel discovered NGC 4102 = H I-225 = h1085 on 12 Apr 1789 (sweep 919) and noted "pB, pL."  JH recorded "B; R; psbM; has a * 12m 35" sp, very near the edge." and measured an accurate position.


Bindon Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, noted on 13 Apr 1852, "I suspect a dark curved passage south of center, probably a new spiral."  Four years later R.J. Mitchell confirmed "I have little doubt this is a spiral" and he made two diagrams of the arm arrangement.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, ~60 stars mag 9.5-13 are resolved in a 8' region including roughly ten mag 10 stars.  The cluster has a very interesting asymmetric arrangement with a perfect 5' string of five stars extending out of the cluster to the WSW. At the west end of the string is the 10th magnitude variable AI Crucis. Two other short strings on the eastern end of the cluster meet up and make a perfect arrow asterism.  NGC 4103 is located 12' ESE of mag 6.6 HD 104971 and two degrees WSW of mag 3.6 Epsilon Crucis.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/27/19 - Tasmania): moderately bright cluster, perhaps 8' diameter, mottled but no obvious resolution.  Situated within a large, glowing naked-eye patch of the Milky Way that includes two bright stars.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4103 = D 291 = h3377 on 30 Apr 1826 and recorded "a cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes, irregular figure, about 6' long and 4' broad."  His position was 12' too far west.


John Herschel observed the cluster on 3 sweeps.  On 14 Mar 1834 he logged "middle of a rich, large, irregularly round cluster; poor VI or rich VII, stars 10..14 mag; diam 5' with stragglers."  His second observation was made under poor conditions: "cluster of stars class VII, pretty rich and compact, stars 10..12 mag, and nearly equal; diameter 5'; the whole field is in a state of wavy fluctuation, owing to the southeast wind, and so bad that each star is dilated into a large puff ball." The final sweep was recorded as "A 10th mag star in centre of a pretty rich close cluster; 5' diameter; irregularly round; stars 10..13 mag."

See observing notes for NGC 4078.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4107 on 17 Apr 1863 and described (loosely translated) a "very small, slightly elongated planetary, a mag 10-11 star follows by 30.2 seconds of time and 1' south."  There is nothing at his position but Harold Corwin found that exactly two min of RA west is NGC 4078, which has a star at his required offset.  d'Arrest recorded the galaxy again on 23 Mar 1865 (and just two days later by Albert Marth) at the correct position and it was also catalogued NGC 4078. So, NGC 4107 = NGC 4078.


In the IC 1 notes, Sherburne Burnham states "delete planetary; the star is np".  This seems to imply Burnham found some object at the NGC position but in the IC 2 notes Dreyer comments "not found by Frost on plates of 4h exposure" [from Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1].  Reinmuth writes "=*13.5, no nebulosity seen.  *10 ssf 2.6', *13.2 spp 1.4'."  Dorothy Carlson classifies NGC 4107 as a star and this error is repeated in the RNGC.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.

LEDA 2210701 appeared extremely faint and small, ~6" diameter.  Once acquired, I could hold it nearly 50% of the time, despite a very low SDSS magnitude (V ~16.0).  The redshift of z = .086 implies a light-travel time of 1.1 billion years!

UGC 7094 is very faint, edge-on 4:1 SW-NE, 1.0'x0.25', very low surface brightness with no noticeable concentration.

George Johnstone Stoney or Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistants, discovered NGC 4109 on 21 Apr 1851. During an observation of NGC 4111, it was noted "the first [NGC 4109] is vF and 6' ssp the second [NGC 4111], which is vB and mE.  A double star is 5' nf, whose smaller component is blue."  Although mentioned in the 1861 publication, John Herschel did not include this galaxy in the GC so Dreyer added it to the GC Supplement (GCS 5618).

The nucleus is very small and brilliant!  Due to dust lanes that run perpendicular to the major axis, the galaxy was slightly brighter on the centerline of the major axis on both sides of the core. The arms taper slightly with a spindle appearance.  A very faint star (~17th mag) is at the SW end of the galaxy.


24" (5/30/16): at 225x; very bright, beautiful edge-on ~7:1 NNW-SSE, 3.5'x0.5'.  Sharply concentrated with a small very bright elongated core, with an unusually bright quasi-stellar nucleus.  An extremely faint star or stellar knot was suspected near the southeast end.  A very wide unequal pair (HJ 2596) with a orange mag 8.1 primary lies 3.7' NE.

Nevertheless, John Herschel combined both (correctly) H-designations in the GC.  John Herschel made an early observation on 11 Apr 1825 (sweep 3) and noted it was "extended in a north-preceding directions towards a star, 30" diameter."


William Herschel probably discovered this galaxy earlier on 18 Jan 1784 and listed it as H. II-14 (later NGC 4119).  See notes on this number. Finally Schwassmann's Sn. 124 = IC 3011, found on a Heidelberg plate on 23 Feb 1900, is an exact match.  So, NGC 3124 = NGC 4119 = IC 3011.

48" (4/22/17): NGC 4147, a class IX globular, was well resolved and impressive at 488x.  It appeared very bright, fairly large, large bright core.  Over 100 stars were resolved including a number of relatively bright 14.5-15.5 stars.  The stellar density increases significantly towards the center where a large number of resolved stars are packed over a hazy, mottled background.  The loose halo was well resolved, a bit scraggly around the edges and extended to ~5' diameter.  The superthin galaxy UGC 7170 lies 18' NNE.


17.5" (4/13/96): moderately bright, fairly small, irregular 2'-2.5' diameter, very small bright core.  A few faint stars are resolved at 220x including one brighter star at the south edge.  Appears on the verge of more extensive resolution.  At 280x, the halo clearly has an irregular outline and several stars are resolved in extensions or star lanes.  The core is mottled and intense but not resolved.


17.5" (3/20/93): fairly bright, moderately large, round, 2.5' diameter.  Approximately six faint stars are just resolved around the edges of the halo including a single easy mag 14 star at the SSW edge.  The compact core is mottled and clumpy but has no clean resolution.  There is an impression of several star lanes in the halo just below the limit of resolution.


A 2010 journal article on the capture of globular clusters, mentions NGC 4147 may be associated with SagDEG (in addition to Terzan 7, Terzan 8, Arp 2 and Pal 12).


William Herschel discovered NGC 4147 = H I-19 = h1106 on 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 170) and recorded "a very brilliant nebula.  Not cometic.  Brightest in the middle but the brightness extends a good way towards the extremes; pS."  His position was 20 seconds of time too large.  The NGC position is accurate (Engelhardt measured a micrometric position). John Herschel made 3 observations; on 23 Mar 1827 he wrote, "B; R; 80"; consists of distinct stars.  A globular cluster."


The first discovery was probably made a month earlier on 15 Feb 1784 (sweep 146) and recorded as H I-11 = NGC 4153, but his position was poor (not unusual in his early sweeps).  See that number and Harold Corwin's NGC identification notes.


Lord Rosse (or assistant William Rambaut) first observed NGC 4147 on 1 Apr 1848 and described it as "a very close cluster of faintish stars, preceded by a small nebula [NGC 4110]."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4151 = H I-165 = h1111, along with NGC 4156, on 17 Mar 1787 (sweep 714) and recorded "vB, A bright nucleus, but the nucleus not in the middle, or perhaps two joined together, the northern on having the nucleus."  CH's reduction is on the northwest side of the halo.


On 26 April 1851 at Birr Castle, Bindon Stoney logged "Has a B, R centre with nucleus, then two dark spaces concentric with the nucleus and outside these faint nebulosity as in figure."  Two night laters he noted "Previous observation rather confirmed. The dark spaces certainly exist, but I cannot be sure that appendages are not parts of spiral branches."  The following year he wrote "Last year's observation confirmed as to dark curved spaces preceding and following centre and faint nebulosity outside them again."   A sketch was included in the 1861 publication (Plate XXVII, Fig. 20).

The whitishness of this nebula is of the milky kind of the unresolveable nebula such as that of [M42]."  There is nothing near his position (during an early sweep when his positions were much more prone to error) but 14' northwest is the globular cluster NGC 4147, which he recored just a month later (14 Mar 1784).

William Herschel rediscovered NGC 4154 = H III-845 on 18 Mar 1790 (sweep 951) and recorded "vF, S, E in the parallel."  His offset from Delta UMa and description (elongated E-W) points to within 1' of UGC 7167.  He first discovered this galaxy on 17 Apr 1789 and recorded it as II-802 (and later became NGC 4149), but his position was 3' too far northwest.  So, NGC 4154 = NGC 4149.


Interestingly, Bigourdan was not able to recover this galaxy and using Heidelberg plates, Reinmuth apparently was confused and noted "*12?; no neb seen; BD +59 1426 nff 3.7'."  Because of Reinmuth's description, Dorothy Carlson identifies NGC 4154 as a star in her 1940 NGC correction list and RNGC classifies NGC 4154 nonexistent.  NGC 4154 is not equated with NGC 4149 in any major catalogue.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4170 and 4171 on 10 May 1864, while observing the NGC 4169 quartet = HCG 61.  He did not provide a position or offset, so it is impossible to assign these numbers to a nearby faint star with any confidence. See notes for NGC 4170.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4186 = T I-38 in 1887.  His position in this paper is 10 seconds of RA preceding and 10' south of M98.  But in list V (AN 2439) he states it is located 20 seconds of time east and 9.5' south of M98.  Dreyer used the latter position, but confused the direction of RA offset and placed NGC 4186 20 sec of RA preceding of M98, instead of following.  His offset in list V establishes NGC 4186 = UGC 7240, but the RA in the NGC is 40 seconds of RA too small.  The correct position was measured by Kobold in 1901 (Strasbourg Annales, Vol 3, 1907).


Because of erroneous NGC position, UGC and MCG misidentify UGC 7223 (which lies 22 sec of RA west of M98 and 7.4' south) as NGC 4186.  Also, CGCG misidentifies CGCG 098-119 as NGC 4186.  The correct identification was first given by Dorothy Carlson in 1940 paper and also given in RNGC and RC3.


It's possible NGC 4186 was first observed at Birr Castle on 10 Feb 1861.  Samuel Hunter noticed a "F, R neb with a * or Nucl in centre", which he described as 1/2 field of finder [13'] north of M98.  If he confused the direction, then the comment probably applies to NGC 4186.

William Herschel observed M98 on 30 Dec 1783 (sweep 73) and recorded "A large, extended, fine nebula.

Near the middle of it a few stars are visible and more suspected; my field will not quite take it in."

The main halo is roughly oval with a weak, elongated brightening oriented SW-NW at the south end.  This low contrast feature is possibly the remnant of a past merger.  A very low surface brightness tidal plume was seen as an ill-defined haze spreading out to the north from the NNW side of the main halo and increasing the N-S dimension to over 1.5'.


17.5" (5/13/88): moderately bright, small, elongated NW-SE, very small bright core, stellar nucleus.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4194 = H II-867 = h1135 on 2 Apr 1791 (sweep 1001) amd noted "pB, vS, stellar."  JH called it "F; vsmbM to a * 12m; 20"."  His position is at the northwest edge of the galaxy.


The nickname Medusa Galaxy was coined by V-V in his Atlas of Interacting Galaxies, Part II: "Of this 'Medusa', the structure of the "head" is as yet unresolved. In this case, three galaxies apparently are coalescent. "Behind", the dwarfs begin to separate."  William Keel repeats the nickname "Medusa" in his April 1993 article "The real astrophysical zoo - Colliding galaxies" in Mercury (ASP). Professional journal papers refer to it as "Medusa" since 2000.

David Todd discovered NGC 4202 = Todd 18 on 6 Feb 1878 during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet (AN 2698).  Dreyer only included eight of the 30 objects which Todd sketched as many were considered doubtful or near nebulae already catalogued.  Todd's sketch of #18, which includes several nearby field stars, clearly identifies NGC 4202 = UGC 7337 at 12 18 08.6 -01 03 52 (2000).  This means that Todd's rough position was 3 tmin too far west although a number of his entries have large errors in RA.


The RNGC misidentifies CGCG 013-109 as NGC 4202, located at 12 14.9 -02 27 (2000).  Early versions of U2000.0 atlas have it misplotted at this position.  I described this galaxy as nonexistent in RNGC Corrections #5 but corrected the identification in #6.  See Corwin's notes.

Strangely, John Herschel also recorded this galaxy twice (h1142 and h1144) on two nights and thought they were different objects because of his different positions and descriptions!  So, H. II-107 = H. II-108 = h1142 = h1144 = NGC 4208 = NGC 4212.  See Corwin's notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4209 = H II-375 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and noted "F, pS."  Dreyer notes in his 1912 revision of WH's catalogues that this object was not found by JH, d'Arrest or Bigourdan.  With respect to NGC 4196, the previous object in the sweep, WH placed II-375 1 min 18 sec foll and 2' N, but there is no object at that position.   This sweep was WH's most productive -- with 74 discoveries -- and this is the only object that cannot be identified with a galaxy.


In an email correspondence (Jul 15 1998) Harold Corwin commented: I've been unable to find NGC 4209. I thought it might be a reobservation of NGC 4185, but both were found by WH on the same night. It is still not a completely impossible identity (e.g. N4208 = N4212, another nebula seen twice within a single sweep), but the chances are against it. I don't see any object aside from N4185 (just over 2 arcmin west) at any reasonable systematic offset (e.g. +- 1 deg, +-10 min, etc) from WH's position.


Wolfgang assigns the number to a star 2 arcmin south-southwest of WH's position. That is certainly possible, but I'd be happier with it if WH had left us a description more complete than "F, pS".

His position is on the northwest side of this Irregular-type galaxy.  The next sweep (1 May) he noted "Can hardly be called a parallelogram for want of corners; but rather irregularly elongated."


John Herschel reported this galaxy as new (h1157) on 27 Apr 1827 and logged,"vF, L, R, gbM, 90"."  His RA, though, was 1 minute too large and he didn't make the connection with his father's H. I 95, so Dreyer later catalogued this entry as NGC 4228.  So NGC 4214 = NGC 4228.


JH reobserved the galaxy 4 years later on 11 Mar 1831 and logged "B, L, gbM, 50", has a double nucleus very indistinct.  The diagram makes it a double neb, the two running together. See fig 71."  The second "nucleus" is a bright HII complex southeast of the core.  At Birr Castle it was also noted in 1856, "Irreg shaped neb with Nucleus excentric and some sort of knot or appendage following.  Possibly another faint knot in preceding end."  Two weeks later, "Much better seen.  There are 4 knots of stars in the neb besides the bright patch south-following."  Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position for this knot in 1893 at Strasbourg.

Samuel Hunter, LdR's assistant on 23 Apr 1860, recorded "a fine E neb, vBM like a globular cluster (I think too it is resolvable?), small star following nucl, where I also think there is very dilute nebulosity, parallel to neb [beyond the dust lane].  The neb is either twisted at n end in p direction or it has a faint companion there?  Dark space around centre?  perhaps only the contrast of the bright centre.  15' long."  The possible nebula Hunter mentions to the north is likely CGCG 069-113.

48" (4/23/17): bright, very large, striking edge-on ~4.5'x1.0' SW-NE, large bright core that bulges near the center but no distinct nucleus.  The galaxy is bisected by a beautiful, relatively wide dust lane that slices through the entire length of the galaxy, only losing contrast at the very tips!  The brightest portion, including the core, is on the north side (northwest facing) of the dust lane.  The cut off section of the galaxy on the south side (southeast facing) of the the dust lane is fairly thin and low surface brightness, though slightly brighter at the center/core.  A mag 14.8 star is at the southwest tip of the galaxy. A mag 11.6 star is at the edge of the halo on the north side [50" from center] and a 9th magnitude star is 2.3' NNE of center.  The galaxy is situated 6' E of mag 7.2 HD 106556, though this star was kept outside the field.  NGC 4226 lies 7' SE. Member of the M109 (NGC 3992) group = LGG 258.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4223 = H II-137 = h1152 on 13 Apr 1784 (sweep 191) and simply noted "r[esolvable]."  Although he was probably rushed (the nearby entries in the sweep were rapidly found), his position is just 2' north of UGC 7319. He reobserved the field on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) and his RA was 20 seconds of time too large, but he also discovered H. III-480 = UGC 7333, which was missed on the earlier sweep.


John Herschel made two observations of H II-137 and one of H III-480.  On 4 Apr 1830 (sweep 250) he recorded "vF; vgbM; a *7m to south".  The description and position clearly points to II-137 = NGC 4223, but he calls it III-480.  JH made a second observation on 24 Apr 1830 (sweep 254), recording both II-137 and III-480, and here's where the problem occurs.  He catalogued the preceding object as h1152 = II-137, but the position is about 1 tmin too far west.  He noted, though, that the position was only estimated from III-480.  Unfortunately, his position for the eastern galaxy (III-480) happens to be a close match (1.4' south) with II-137.  The result is that JH's entry in the Slough catalogue for NGC 4241 = h1165 = III-480 contains two observations -- one for II-137 and one for III-480, with a position matching II-137.  Furthermore, his entry for h1152 = NGC 4223 = II-137 points to a blank part of the sky, 1 tmin of RA west of II-137.  In the NGC notes, Dreyer mentions NGC 4223 was not found by d'Arrest, obviously because of the poor position.


The two galaxies were later picked up by Arnold Schwassmann in 1899 on a Heidelberg plate, placed accurately, and catalogued as IC 3102 (brighter west-northwest galaxy) and IC 3115 (fainter east-southeast galaxy).   Modern catalogues generally identify the brighter galaxy as NGC 4241 = H II-137 and the fainter galaxy as IC 3115 = H III-480, leaving NGC 4223 = h1152 without an identification.  Dreyer recommended "h1152 (rough place only) is to be struck out" in his notes to "Scientific Papers of William Herschel".


But, Harold Corwin argues that since WH and JH observed both galaxies, the correct assignment should be NGC 4223 = H II-137 = h1152 = h1165 (sweep 250) = IC 3102 and NGC 4241 = H III-480 = h1165 (sweep 254) = IC 3115.  This changes, though, the long-standing identification of NGC 4241 as the brighter western galaxy.  See Corwin's identification notes.

Size 6'


14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 73x and 178x): roughly 40 stars are resolved in a 7'x5' region (the outline is pretty arbitrary), roughly elongated SW-NE.  Appears as an unimpressive asterism with no rich subgroups.  A mag 11.5/13 pair at 13" separation is southwest of center with several mag 13-14.5 stars to its northeast.  A mag 12 star 2' SW and a mag 11 star 4' SW of the central pair are all collinear.  Located 18' SW of mag 5 Delta Crucis.


Note the group of stars described here is 12' S of ESO 171-SC14, the cluster identified as NGC 4230 in most sources including SIMBAD and ESO.  ESO 171-SC14 is a cluster of roughly two dozen mag 13-14 stars in a 3' region just southeast of mag 8.4 HD 106826.  A couple of mag 11 stars are 2' E and 3.5' NE of the mag 8.4 star, but these are detached.

18" (4/26/08): this huge, low surface brightness galaxy extends roughly 12'x3', oriented NNW-SSE.  There is only a very weak central brightening with no obvious core.  A very faint star appears to be superimposed near the geometric center and just to the south is a slightly elongated brightening (possibly the core).


Another brighter region is near the north end of the galaxy.  This patch seems elongated at 45° to the major axis, appearing to extend out to the west of the main glow on the north end.  Images reveal this is a gigantic HII complex and is catalogued in the Hodge-Kennicutt Atlas of HII regions (1983AJ, 88, 296) as NGC 4236:[HK83] 15, 16 and 17.


The south end is also splotchy and at the very south tip were two very faint "stars" oriented SW-NE that seemed slightly fuzzy (probably small HII knots).  The first is also known as VII Zw 446, considered by Zwicky as a "blue patchy compact [galaxy]."


17.5" (3/29/89): faint, extremely large, edge-on 5:1 NNW-SSE.  Appears as a ghostly streak about 20' length with only a broad, weak concentration!  Best at low power due to size and low surface brightness.

18" (5/28/06): fairly faint, small, round, 25" diameter.  Contains a very small bright core ~10" diameter which increases to a bright substellar nucleus. Located just east of a mag 13 star (24" from the center).


18" (3/13/04): faint, small, round, 30" diameter, strongly concentrated with a very small bright core and stellar nucleus.  A mag 13 star is barely off the west edge.  Observation made through thin clouds.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4240 on 20 May 1875.  His micrometric position and description (mag 12 star 1/2' southwest) matches MCG -02-31-029 = PGC 39411.


Andrew Ainslie Common found the galaxy again in 1880, assumed it was new and recorded it as #25 in his Copernicus discovery list.  He noted "Like a pair of stars 90°; the f one is a nebulous star."  His RA is 11 sec too large (estimated positions using setting circles) and his description is a perfect match.  Dreyer, who edited the journal Copernicus, added a footnote that Common's #25 was identical to Tempel's nebula.


Finally, Lewis Swift probably found this galaxy again on 27 Apr 1886 and described it in list III-62 as "pB; eS; pB * nr p; Looks a first like a double star.  Curious object."  There is nothing at his position but 1.4 degrees due north is the same galaxy found by Tempel and Common, and his description fits (very similar to Common's!).  Dreyer assumed Swift's object was new and catalogued it as NGC 4243.  So, NGC 4240 = NGC 4243.

This galaxy is identified as IC 3115 in modern catalogues and the brighter, western galaxy is usually catalogued as NGC 4241.  My identification (NGC 4241 = IC 3115 = UGC 7333) follows the historical record.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4241 = H III-480 = h1165 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) and recorded "vF, L. Would not have been seen if it had not been for the preceding [H II-137 = UGC 7319].  His position is just 1' from UGC 7333 = PGC 39483.  JH made a single observation on 24 Apr 1830 (sweep 254) and simply recorded "vF."  Unfortunately, JH's position is poor, and lands very close to UGC 7319, causing much confusion in modern catalogues.


Arnold Schwassmann found both galaxies on a Heidelberg plate of the Virgo region in 1899 and measured accurate positions.  Schwassmann assumed they were new and Dreyer recatalogued the pair as IC 3102 and IC 3115.  So, NGC 4241 = IC 3115 = UGC 7333 and NGC 4223 = IC 3102 = UGC 7319.  Modern catalogues, though, identify UGC 7319 as NGC 4241 and UGC 7333 as IC 3115.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes on NGC 4223 for the full story.

48" (4/1/11): stunning view of this beautiful, asymmetric two-armed spiral at 375x. The galaxy is sharply concentrated with a brilliant 1' core that increases to a sharp stellar nucleus. The brighter more open arm is attached on the east side of the very bright core.  It unwinds beautifully and expands counterclockwise for ~225° where it ends to the NW of center.  As the arm passes south of the core there is a bright, well defined knot (sketched and later measured 0.9' S of the nucleus) with two additional diffuse knots in this arm 1.2' SW of center and 1.9' W of center.  The arm continues to sweep north on the west side, where it is well separated from the main body.


A second long sweeping fainter arm is attached on the west side of the core and unfolds counterclockwise towards the NE.  It contains a diffuse knot ~1.2' NNW of center and terminates near an ill-defined knot 2' NE of center.  The halo of the galaxy is more extensive on this side and contains a prominent knot 1.8' E of center.  This knot is at the end of another more ill-defined arm on the north side of the core heading east that contains additional mottled clumps.


24" (5/24/20): at 225x and 375x; relatively large bright circular core, ~1' diameter, increased to a very bright, small mottled nucleus.  The irregular outer halo extended ~4' diameter. The brighter and larger arm was easily visible; it emerged from the east side of the core and curved counterclockwise to the south of the core and then extended to the WSW before dimming out.  A very subtle brightening or knot was seen within the arm [50" S of center]. A second arm of much lower contrast began on the west side of the core and headed in the NNE direction for ~1.5' before fading into the halo.  A very faint knot (NGC 4254:[HK83] 1), was visible in the outer halo on the east side [1.8' ENE of center] and was easily seen with averted.  A mag 13.5 star is just outside the halo, 2' ESE of center.


18" (4/10/04): a fairly prominent arm is attached at the southeast end of the large, bright core and winds along the south side towards the southwest.  This arm is clearly detached from the core with a dark gap between the arm and the core.  The northern arm is ill-defined and appears more like a couple of short "brush-strokes" close north of the core.


17.5" (5/10/86): very bright, large, bright core, stellar nucleus.  There is an obvious spiral arm attached at the SE side of the core and winding along the south side towards the west.  There is a dark gap between the spiral arm and the core along the south and west side.  A second shorter, diffuse arm is visible on the north side.

William Parsons, the third Earl of Rosse, discovered spiral structure in April of 1846 using the 72" Leviathan of Parsonstown.  The observation was made a full year after the spiral nature of M51 was discovered as LdR's attention was diverted to the Irish potato famine.  M99 was the second confirmed spiral, though a month earlier NGC 2903 was noted as having a "tendency" to an "annular or spiral arrangement".  On 11 Mar 1848, observing assistant William Rambaut described M99 as a "Spiral with a bright star above; a thin portion of the nebula reaches across this star and some distance past it.  Principal spiral at the bottom, and turning towards the right.” Lord Rosse’s outstanding sketch showed at least 4 arms. It was published in the Philosphical Transactions of 1850 (plate XXXV, figure 2), alongside his sketch of M51. A good copy of the sketch is at http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/rosse/index.html.


William Lassell sketched M99 on 31 Mar 1862 from Malta with his 48-inch and included three principal arms and one or two offshoots .  He noted "Viewed with power 285.  The spiral form is very evident, more so, I think than in any other nebula I have seen."

It was discovered after Messier's final catalogue was sent to publication but was included in a letter dated 6 May 1783  to Johann Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch and published in the 1786 Jarbuch volume. Méchain wrote, "In July 1781, I have found another one close to Ursa Major near the star No. 3 of Canes Venatici & 1 deg more or less to the south; I estimate its right ascension 181d 40' & its declination about 49d."


William Herschel independently discovered this galaxy on 9 Mar 1788 and recorded H. V 43 as "v brilliant.  BN with much fainter branches from np to sf, about 15' long, and the sf running out into vF nebulosity extending a great way."  On 1 Apr 1788 (sweep 823) he logged "vB, mE directly in the meridian [N-S] with faint branches 10 or 12' long, BNM with the nucleus not ground."


John Herschel made 4 observations and recorded (sweep 330) "vB; vL; vsvmbM to an oval nucl; 8 or 9' long; 4 or 5' broad."  The 20 Apr 1857 observation at Birr Castle (by R.J. Mitchell) reads "a vL, B, E neb np sf, much mottled.  The f edge is comparatively sharp and well defined, but in the p and n edge there is a great inequality of light.  Nucleus elongated, vB part to north of nucleus."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 4279 = Sw. III-64, along with NGC 4280 and 4285, on 6 May 1886.  His description reads "eeF; vS; R; 1st of 3."

18" (5/8/04): this number may apply to a trio of mag 15 stars situated between NGC 4279 and NGC 4285.  The two brighter stars were noted, although I was not looking for the fainter third star.  This identification is uncertain and listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 4280 = Sw. III-65, along with NGC 4279 and 4285, on 6 May 1886.  There are only two galaxies here and either NGC 4279 or 4280 is nonexistent or refers to a faint star(s).  Assuming NGC 4279 = PGC 39812 , then Swift's offsert to NGC 4280 falls close to a 45" string of 3 mag 14.5/15.5/16.5 stars.   His description "eeeF; vS; R; 2nd of 3" is not helpful in pinning down the identification.  So, this number is lost or might apply to one of more of these stars.

They are scattered about."  There is nothing near his position, but exactly one degree south is NGC 4281, the last of these four galaxies.  He swept the field again 6 days later and measured an accurate position for NGC 4281, and simply noted (for II-573) "a nebula, but cloudy."


JH recorded the nebula as a "nova" on 27 Dec 1827 with the description "vB; E; bM; 60"."  His RA was 47 sec too large (same error he made with NGC 4277 and 4273), so he didn't realize the equivalence with II-573.  On a later sweep he observed H II-573 again, measured an accurate position and reported "vB, vL, R, pgbM, 3', 3 more seen." So, errors were made by both WH and JH, though Dreyer sorted things out pretty well in his 1912 publication of WH's catalogues.

Here are my notes on UGC 7411, the galaxy identified as NGC 4301 in the MCG, PGC and RC3:

Fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, broad weak concentration.  Located 19' NNW of M61.


George Johnstone Stoney or Bindon Stoney discovered NGC 4301 on 21 Apr 1851.  While observing the field of M61 he noted, "Another neb 10' nf."  This could be interpreted as 10' NE of M61 or 10' NE of NGC 4292, but UGC 7439 (= NGC4303A ) is 10' NE of M61, which suggests NGC 4301 = UGC 7439.


Heinrich d'Arrest and Herman Schultz were unable to find NGC 4301 at the GC position.  Because of this, Dreyer assumed Stoney's object was 10' northeast of NGC 4292 (the other object grouped together) and modified the position of NGC 4301 in the NGC.  As a result, UGC 7411 (located 12' NNE of NGC 4292) assumed to be new when it was found on plates taken by Keeler with the Crossley reflector in 1898-1900 and catalogued in the 1908 list of new nebulae (Publ Lick Obs, Vol VIII).  UGC 7411 was misidentified as NGC 4301 in the MCG, PGC, RC3, NGC 2000.0 and RNGC.  UGC identified UGC 7439 as NGC 4301.  Malcolm Thomson investigated the identifications (WSQJ 10/92) and Harold Corwin has a very thorough analysis in his NGC/IC notes.

The core is slightly brighter on the east side of the dust lane.  The northern tip extends beyond a mag 14.2 star off the northwest end.  A mag 14.3 star is just west of the southern tip.

48" (4/5/13) and 5/1/19) at 375x and 488x, the visible structure was similar to photographic detail!  A bright bar extends north-south and is sharply concentrated with a very small, round, intense nucleus.  A bright arm is attached right at the north side of the bar and sweeps counterclockwise 180° to the south end, along the east side.  A brighter region was visible in the arm east of the nucleus, which include HII regions NGC 4303:[HK83] #35/39/41/45/49, from the Hodge-Kennicutt "Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  At this location, the arm has a sharp turn [63°] and angles towards the SW. The arm dims rapidly on the south end, but I was able to follow it much further SW in the outer halo, where it passes just north of a mag 14.0 star [2.4' SW of center].


The western arm is attached at the southern end of the bar and sweeps north on the west side.  A bright, elongated patch is on the southern end of this arm, which includes [HK83] #155, ~45" SSW of the nucleus.  The arm extends inside a mag 14 star in the west side of the halo [1.2' WSW of center] and then sharply dims but extends towards #242, a nearly detached faint knot 1.2' WNW of center.


A partial outer arm, not attached to the core, was easily visible on the north side, angling southwest to northeast.  At the NE end of this short bright arm is the HII knot [HK83] #91, a very bright, 15" knot, 1.2' NNE of center.  The arm dims suddenly on the northeast end but a diffuse extension continues to wrap counterclockwise to the southeast at the edge of the eastern halo.


24" (5/20/20 and 5/24/20): viewed SN 2020jfo (Type II), discovered on May 6th 1.1' W and 0.5' N of the center of the galaxy.  This is the 8th SN discovered in M61 since 1926, the most of any Messier.  It appeared very close in brightness to a mag 14.2 star that is 1.2' W of center and collinear with another mag 14 star 2.4' SW of center.


M61 appeared strongly concentrated with a bright elongated core or bar oriented N-S that increased to an intense, very small nucleus.  Three arms were easily visible. A short but well defined arm angled SW-NE on the north side (outside the eastern arm). It ended at a relatively bright HII knot [HK83] #91, which was well defined and noticed immediately. The eastern arm, which emerged from the north side of the bar, was very well defined and extended east of the core, then headed south and angled towards the southwest. The western arm began on the south or southeast side of the bar and rotated counterclockwise towards to the west and bent in the northwest direction. It past inside a 14th mag star [1.1' W of center]. A subtle brightening or knot, [HK83] #155, was seen along this arm 40" S of center (collinear with the northern knot and the center).


18" (5/12/07): spiral structure was easily visible.  One arm is attached at the north end and sweeps towards the northeast and then hooks to the south along the east side.  A bright knot ([HK83] #91) is within the arm at the northeast end.  A second broader arm is attached at the south end and sweeps towards the southwest and then hooks towards the north on the west side.  The central region contains a bright, stellar nucleus.


13.1" (5/26/84): very bright, large, bright stellar nucleus.  Two spiral arms are faintly visible; one arm is attached south of the nucleus and winds towards the west and then north.  A slightly brighter arm is attached north of the nucleus and winds along the east side towards the south.  In the field with NGC 4292 11' NW and NGC 4301 10' NE.


Italian astronomer Barnaba Oriani discovered M61 = NGC 4303 = H I-139 = h1202 on 5 May 1779 while observing the Comet of 1779.  It was independently found by Messier the same night, though initially he mistook it for the comet, finally recognizing it was a nebula on 11 May.  William Herschel found M61 on 17 Apr 1786 (sweep 553), assumed it was new, and catalogued it as I-139 with the summary description (2 observations) "eB; vBN; r, 6 or 7' dia."  John Herschel observed in on 3 consecutive sweeps in 1828, describing it on 10 April as "very faintly bicentral.  The two nuclei 90" distance in position angle 45 to 50° north-following."  This comment was the source of the GC and NGC description "bi-nuclear" and the second nucleus is very likely the bright knot on the northern spiral arm.


Bindon Stoney discovered spiral structure on 1 Mar 1851 and noted "spiral, 2 knots, centre bright.  There is another neb. 10' nf."  A sketch made of M61 on 14 Apr 1852 was included in the 1861 publication, though misidentified as h1196 [NGC 4292].  The two knots clearly included in the sketch are [HK83] #91 and [HK83] #155, mentioned in my 24-inch observation. The neb 10' nf probably refers to NGC 4301 = NGC 4303A = UGC 7439.  See that number.


Host of 8 supernovae since 1926 (six of these since 1961), making M61 the current record holder among Messier galaxies.  The first (SN 1926A) was found by Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory.

On the DSS, this galaxy is a face-on barred spiral similar to NGC 1300.  A bright HII region lies on the south side and this probably contributed to the appearance of "mottled" or having a superimposed "star".

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4320 on 15 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His position, measured on 4 nights, matches UGC 7452 and he mentions the mag 15 star (called mag 17) which precedes by 5.6 sec of RA.  In the IC 2 Notes section, Dreyer mentions that Frost was unable to identify this galaxy on a Harvard plate of 4 hours exposure, although it was included in Adelaide Ames' 1930 "A Catalogue of 2778 Nebulae, including the Coma-Virgo Group", based on plates taken with the Bruce astrograph at Arequipa.

82" (5/4/19, McDonald Observatory): at 400x; this superb spiral nearly filled the 10' eyepiece field and displayed two main high contrast, very thin and beautiful spiral arms.  They wrapped towards the center, which was sharply concentrated with an extremely bright nucleus.


48" (4/18/15): stunning view of this gorgeous spiral at 375x and 488x.  M100 was sharply concentrated with an intensely bright circular nucleus.  Two prominent, high contrast arms (fairly narrow) each rotated ~270° and could be clearly traced to within 1' of the center.  The south and north outer tips of the arms are between 5.5'-6' apart with the overall size ~6'x5'.


One arm begins off the WNW side of the core with a bright mottled section angling nearly north-south for ~25".  This section contains multiple HII sites NGC 4321:[HK83]220/223/229/230 from Hodge and Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  The arm curls clockwise around the south side.  A small (~8" dia.) HII knot (#160/171/172) is within this arm, 1.0' S of center.  Just to the east [1.5' SE of center] is a brighter, mottled section that contains a close pair [18" separation] of compact HII knots (#110 and #69/87).  The surface brightness of the arm abruptly drops as it shoots due north on the east side of the halo for ~3'.  The arm dims further as it curves west on the northeast side of the outer halo and ends just southeast of mag 15 star situated 2.9' NNW of center.


The second arm begins ~1' SE of center as a thicker, much brighter region.  The Hodge-Kennicutt Atlas catalogues numerous HII designations in this region, but none stood out individually.  The arm sharply narrows and rotates clockwise around the north side of the core towards the west.  It passes just south of two mag 15.5 stars, where there is a slightly brighter mottled section containing HII regions #252/253.  The arm dims significantly as it heads south on the west side of the halo.  Finally, it weakens further and spreads out at the end on the southwest side of the galaxy [2.6' from center].


18" (5/15/10): very bright, large, ~4.0-4.5' diameter, sharply concentrated with a very bright round core.  Spiral structure was evident at 220x with a spiral arm attached on the southwest side of the core region.  This arm sweeps east on the south side, heading in the direction of a mag 14 star just off the southeast end of the galaxy, but bending north.  On the north side off of the core, a portion of the inner spiral arm is visible oriented E-W and extending to the northwest of the core region.


17.5" (5/23/87): bright, very large, almost round, well-defined bright core surrounded by a large, fainter halo.  Two faint galaxies NGC 4323 and NGC 4328 lie 5' N and 6' E, respectively.  This is the brightest spiral in the Coma-Virgo cluster.


Pierre Méchain discovered M100 = NGC 4321 = h1211, along with M98 and M99, on 15 Mar 1781 and Messier verified it a month later.  William Herschel described "a vL nebula of about 10' in diameter, with a small bright cluster of supposed stars in the middle.  It is followed at the distance of 6 or 8' by another distinct F, S, R, r nebula [NGC 4328] which is nearly in the same parallel with the great one."  His description obviously refers to the sharply concentrated core, though he gave this as an example in his 1814 publication of a nebula probably consisting of a cluster of stars.


Lord Rosse discovered spiral structure in M100 on 9 Mar 1850 (or earlier) and included M100 in his list of "Spiral or curvilinear" nebulae in the 1850 PT paper.   William Lassell published two sketches of M100 using his 48-inch on Malta on 24 and 26 Apr 1862.  The second one is an excellent rendering of the spiral arms, which both wrap about 1 1/2 revolutions around the core.  Dreyer's comment "(L): 2-branched spiral", is based on this sketch.


M101 is one of the largest and brightest spirals in the Virgo cluster.  It was the fist Virgo cluster member that the HST observed Cepheid variables (1993) and derived a distance of 55 million light years (since revised to ~50 million light years).  Five supernovae have been recorded: 1901B, 1914A, 1959E, 1979C, 2006X.  The first two were found on archived plates and announced by Heber Curtis in Lick Observatory Bulletin 300 (1917LicOB...9..108C). SN 1901B was found on a photograph taken on 17 Mar 1901 and SN 1914A was found on a photograph taken 2 Mar 1914.

24" (5/22/17): this number *possibly* applies to a 13th magnitude star 5.7' NW of the center of M100 and 4.8' due west of NGC 4323 (CGCG 099-031).  This single star clearly appeared stellar 200x-375x and was bright enough that I'm surprised if Tempel would have confused it as a nebulous object unless the seeing was very poor.  Most catalogues assign both NGC 4322 and 4323 to the single galaxy to the north of M100.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4322, along with NGC 4323 and NGC 4327, in 1882, during an observation of M100.  In the text section of his 5th discovery list (AN 2439) he mentions "on my drawing are three other very faint nebula in the vicinity, two north and close to M100 and the third south of [NGC 4328]."  There is only a single galaxy close north of M100 and none to the south of NGC 4328.  RNGC and MCG equate NGC 4322 = NGC 4323 although Corwin suggests NGC 4323 should apply to the (single) galaxy and NGC 4322 to a star further west, whose position is given here.  This assignment for NGC 4322 is really just a guess, though, so I've left the designation as "Not Found".  Of course, the galaxy listed here could be identified as NGC 4322 with NGC 4323 left as "Not Found".

24" (5/22/17): at 375x; very faint, fairly small, roundish, ~0.4' diameter, very low surface brightness with no structure.  Could often hold with averted but required concentration to pick up.  Located 5.3' NNE of the center of M100.  A mag 13 star is 4.8' due W.  This galaxy was marginal in Carter Scholz's 16", which makes me question if Wilhelm Tempel would have picked it up in an 11" refractor.


18" (5/15/10): this faint galaxy is located just 5.2' NNE of the center of the face-on spiral M100.  At 220x it appeared very faint, fairly small, ~0.5'x0.4' (difficult to determine the orientation), very low surface brightness with no central brightening.  This galaxy is the fainter of two companions of M100 with NGC 4328 6' E of center.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4323, along with NGC 4322 and NGC 4327, in 1882, during an observation of M100.  He mentions "on my drawing are three other very faint nebula in the vicinity, two north and close to M100 and the third south of [NGC 4328]."  But there is only a single galaxy north of M100, namely CGCG 099-031 = PGC 40171.  RNGC and MCG label this galaxy as NGC 4322 = NGC 4333 but Harold Corwin argues that NGC 4322 is probably a star 4.8' west of the galaxy, which implies only NGC 4323 should be used for the galaxy (placing the numbers in order of RA).  See Corwin's identification notes.


In 1908 this galaxy was reported as a new "nebula" based on photographs taken by Keeler and Perrine in 1898-1900 and catalogued (#423) in the 1908 Publications of Lick Observatory, Vol VIII.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4327, along with NGC 4322 and 4323, in 1882, during an observation of M100.  In the notes section of paper V (AN 2439) Tempel commented, "There are three other, very subtle nebulae in the vicinity [of M100], two to the north, near to M100, and the third to the south of NGC 2894." There is no nebula to the south of NGC 2894 (and only one to the north of M100) and it was not found visually or photographically by Bigourdan, Frost, Carlson and the RNGC.  Corwin suggests a star that might have been picked up by Tempel, but the magnitude (roughly 16.5) seems too faint, so I've classified it as "not found".

Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 4338 on 19 May 1863 and described "vF, E, cometary, quite difficult to see because of dusk. The place has not yet been verified."  There is nothing at his position, but exactly 1.0 min of time west is NGC 4310, discovered by WH.  d'Arrest measured NGC 4310 on 3 other nights, but not the one he recorded NGC 4338.  Harold Corwin equates NGC 4338 = NGC 4310.


RNGC, RC3, SIMBAD and secondary sources such as WikiSky, Uranometria 2000. Atlas and Megastar misidentify IC 3247 as NGC 4338.  IC 3247 is located 20' south of d'Arrest's position.  Reinmuth also questioned if NGC 4338 = IC 3247 but Malcolm Thomson feels this galaxy is too faint and would not have been visible in d'Arrest's 11-inch refractor in twilight -- I agree.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4341 = H III-95 on 13 Apr 1784 (sweep 191) and recorded "Three [along with H. III 94 = NGC 4343 and H. III 96 = NGC 4342], all eF and vS, R nebula."  His single position is between NGC 4343 and 4342. H III-95 = UGC 7472 is the faintest of the three brightest galaxies (out of five) that WH likely viewed.


Bigourdan observed the group on 23 Apr 1895 and measured the position of this galaxy (UGC 7472).  Likewise, Arnold Schwassmann measured a very accurate position (Sn. 17) on a Heidelberg plate on 27 Nov 1900.  Dreyer assumed they found a new object, but IC 3260 = NGC 4341.


Because of the ambiguity with the identification of NGC 4341, the CGCG and MCG label this galaxy IC 3260.  UGC and RNGC use both designations. See Harold Corwin's identification notes for the full story.

His single position is between NGC 4343 and 4342. As there are 5 galaxies in this group, there has been considerable confusion on the correct identifications.  Harold Corwin assumed Herschel observed the three brightest galaxies here and suggests the identifications NGC 4341 = IC 3260 = UGC 7472, NGC 4342 = IC 3256 = UGC 7466 and NGC 4343 = UGC 7465, though the CGCG (Herzog) argues the NGC designations should be dropped and the unambiguous IC designations used exclusively.


Bigourdan found this galaxy again on 23 Apr 1895 and his B. 291 (later IC 3256) matches this galaxy and the CGCG and MCG use the IC designation.   The identifications are discussed in CGCG Vol 5, the RC 2 notes, Webb Society Quarterly Journal articles in Jan 1986 and Jan 1990, Herzog's 1967 paper "On the Identification of Five Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster" (1967PASP...79..627H), as well as Harold Corwin's identification notes!

Gerhard Lohse found NGC 4345 in 1886 with the 15.5-inch refractor at Wigglesworth's observatory near Scarborough, England.  There is nothing at his position, but 1.0 min of RA west is NGC 4319 = H I-276.  So, likely NGC 4345 = NGC 4319 with a 1 tmin error in RA.  Dorothy Carlson identifies NGC 4345 as a star near Lohse's position, but since the description mentions "pL" this is very unlikely.

Christian Peters discovered NGC 4347 around 1881 with the 13.5-inch refractor at the Hamilton College Observatory.  The only objects close to his position are faint stars.  Perhaps coincidentally, 13' south of his position is NGC 4348 (discovered by WH).  He expressly mentions in his description "this can hardly be GC 2911 [NGC 4348]", due to the discrepany in position.  Assuming that's the case, this object is probably lost, though may refer to one or more faint stars.

This cluster is rich and uniform in magnitudes except for a single mag 8.4 star (HD 107944) on the SE side which stands out over the large number of mag 10.5-12.5 stars.  The outline is elongated NW to SE but the stars are distributed fairly evenly within the boundaries.  This is a very pleasing group and an easy binocular object.  Located along the western side of the Southern Cross and 75' NNW of Alpha Crucis (Acrux)!


10x30mm Canon IS (3/27/19 - Tasmania): fairly faint, large glow, appears oval or elongated.  No resolution except for a star at the edge.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4349 = D292 on 30 Apr 1826 and described "a pretty cluster of extremely small stars, resembling a pretty large faint nebula, about 6' or 7' diameter: the compression is very gradual to the centre; a pretty bright star is in the following side of the cluster, round figure."  His position was quite accurate (about 4' SE of the center of the cluster near the brightest member).  The position here corresponds with the densest portion of the cluster.


JH observed the cluster on three sweeps.  On 14 Mar 1834 he logged "chief star 10m of a fine rich cluster which fills field."  Two weeks later (31 Mar 1834) he noted "a large loose cluster of small stars 12..14th mag; irregularly round; not very rich; little compressed in the middle; diam. 10'." His final sweep three years later described a "cluster class VI. Very large, very bright, A star about 8..9 mag taken but the brightest part of the cluster is about 4' N.p. Fills field; not much compressed in the middle; stars 12..13th mag; This cluster was found by Mr Maclear in this sweep made with him, not being aware at the time of its having been seen in Sweep 432."

This galaxy described above is identified as NGC 4364 in all modern catalogues.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4358 = H III-799 = h1230 on 17 Apr 1789 (sweep 923) and logged "vF, vS."  His re-reduced position is just 11 sec of RA preceding UGC 7479.  This is a double galaxy with a very faint companion off the southwest edge -- too faint to have picked up by WH and JH certainly did not see it.  The next objects in the sweep were H III-800 = NGC 4362 and H III-801 = NGC 4364, described together as "two, both cF, cS, R".  There are only two galaxies here that were likely seen by WH, and Dreyer notes in the 1912 Scientific Papers that "very probably the word 'two' refers to III 799 and III 800, as nobody [including JH, Bigourdan and d'Arrest] seems to have seen three nebulae in the place."


JH, Bigourdan and d'Arrest only found two galaxies (h1230 and h1231) with his first position matching III-799 = UGC 7479 and his second position clearly referring to CGCG 293-018 = PGC 40350.  CGCG identifies the two components to UGC 7479 as NGC 4358 + 4364 and MCG and RNGC both identify the stellar western component as NGC 4358 and the main eastern component as NGC 4364.


Corwin concludes only the two brighter galaxies should receive NGC designations (and WH was mistaken on the third nebula he reported).  In which case, NGC 4358 = UGC 7479 and NGC 4362 = NGC 4364 = CGCG 293-018 = PGC 40350.  This leaves the southwest component of UGC 7479 without a NGC designation.

48" (5/3/19): at 488x; fascinating bright blue planetary with a very bright mag 13 central star.  Unfiltered, the unusual feature are two opposite "handles" or thick arcs that are attached just outside the central region on the WNW and ESE sides.  Adding a NPB filter, two arms or loops lit up on the SW and NE sides.  These loops appeared similar to spiral arms attached to the main body and rotated counterclockwise!


48" (2/20/12): the unusual structure in this planetary shocked me at 488x as previous views in my 17.5" and 18" had only showed a hint of detail.  The two main components are large bulbous lobes or wings with an irregular surface brightness that jut out of the central region in a WNW and ESE direction, with the WNW lobe slightly brighter.  More surprising were two arms and loops, similar to spiral arms in a galaxy, that extend out to the NE and SW and curve clockwise.  The arm to the southwest is very thin where it emerges from the central portion, so it appeared partially detached!  The arm on the NE side clearly bends south but was not as sharply defined.  Between the lobes (WNW and ESE) and arms (SW and NE) were darker gaps or regions creating a unique, basically symmetric shape that is elongated SW-NE (arms are longer), ~1.8'x1.4'.  At the center is a very bright mag 13 central star.  A fainter, more roundish halo envelops the brighter components.


17.5" (5/15/99): 100x easily reveals the bright central star surrounded by a moderately high surface brightness halo ~1' in size. At 220x, the central star appears 13th magnitude and the halo gradually brightens towards the center.  With averted vision, the halo increases to roughly 90"x60", extended SW-NE, with an ill-defined edge.  I had the strong impression of an extension or hook on the southwest end of the PN, which was confirmed on the DSS image (a similar extension is also on the NE end).


13": moderately bright, fairly large, slightly elongated.  The mag 13 central star is fairly easy at 165x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4361 = H I-65 = h1231 on 7 Feb 1785 (sweep 368) and recorded "vB, pL, mbM.

R[esolved] with power 320, and is no doubt a globular cluster; fades away to nothing.  So, JH was convinced it was a globular.  Surprisingly it was misclassified as a galaxy in de Vaucoleurs' 1st "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies" (RC1)!


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis described NGC 4361 as "central star about mag 10; this is surrounded by an irregular oval mass whose brighter parts are about 44"x39" in pa 103°.  From this central portion two arms (spiral whorls?) go out in pa 20° and portions of a very faint ring 81" can just be made out."  (1918PLicO..13...55C).  Early photographs were taken with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector between 1912-14 at the Helwan Observatory near Cairo.  The director Harold Knox-Shaw also described a "Round nebula 1' diameter from which proceed spiral arms."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4364 = H III-801 on 17 Apr 1789 (sweep 923) and recorded "Two [with III-800 = NGC 4362], both cF, vS, R."  There is only a single galaxy (h1233 = CGCG 293-018 = PGC 40350) situated 2' southeast of III-799 = NGC 4358, so WH's observation is clearly in error.  Dreyer suggest that perhaps "Two" should be interpreted as "Two with III-799", as there are only two galaxies that were likely seen.


See discussion under NGC 4358 and Corwin's notes for the identifications of NGC 4358, 4362 and 4364.  CGCG 293-018 is labeled NGC 4364 in all modern catalogues.

Dreyer notes that III-97 was observed one only 1 sweep and not seen again when nearby II-144 = NGC 4370 was reobserved on 28 Dec 1785.  It was also not seen by JH, d'Arrest, or by Samuel Hunter with the 72".  So, Dreyer suggested NGC 4366 = NGC 4370 and this was repeated by Dorothy Carlson in her 1940 list of NGC errata.


But 5' northeast of NGC 4365 is CGCG 042-087 = PGC 40421, a faint galaxy that WH might have picked up.  This galaxy is identified as NGC 4366 in the RNGC, PGC and Deep Sky Field Guide though not in CGCG or MCG.   But this galaxy is slightly further from NGC 4370 than NGC 4365, so it seems odd WH would record it together with NGC 4370.  So, the identification NGC 4366 = PGC 40421 is very uncertain.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4367 on 19 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and also measured 3 nights later.  There is nothing at his position except a mag 15 star with a mag 17.5 companion at 13" separation (likely too faint to have been seen by d'Arrest).  On the second observation, he mentions this object follows NGC 4351 by 35 seconds of time, so the identification with this star is nearly certain.


Royal Frost reported NGC 4367 was not found on a 4-hour Bruce plate (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No. 1).  Karl Reimuth equates NGC 4367 with IC 3311, neglecting the difference of 0.9 tmin in RA.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4368 = H III-38 on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 174) and noted "vF, vS."  There is nothing at his position and Bigourdan was unsuccessful in locating NGC 4368, and neither was Frost photographically (Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1, Virgo-Coma survey).  Dreyer notes in the 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that the RA is possibly 1 tmin too great.  Several nebulae discovered by WH that night (including NGCs 3810, 4067, 4294, 4313, 4352, 4371, and 4429) have comparable errors.  So, it's reasonable that NGC 4368 is a duplicate of NGC 4325 (located 1.5 min of RA west of WH's position). See Corwin's identification notes for more.

V = 7.5;  Size 18.6';  Surf Br = 1.2


24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, NGC 4372 is a highly-resolved, low-concentration class globular.  A mag 6.6 star just 5.5' NW of center was a bit distracting but scores of stars were resolved over the 4' core, appearing to criss-cross the center in numerous lanes.  The outer halo was very large, nearly 15' in diameter, and resolved into a couple of hundred stars.  Except for the brighter and denser core, this globular appeared similar to a very large, fully resolved open cluster.


18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this large, bright globular was an impressive object and beautifully resolved into 150-200 stars mag 13 and fainter, within a 13'-14' diameter.  The unresolved background glow was relatively faint for such a well-resolved globular.  The large 4' core was only slightly brighter and there was no nucleus (class 12 concentration), although a close pair of brighter mag 12.5 stars is near the center.  Scores of stars appeared linked in chains and loops, particularly in the outer halo, which is quite irregular and ragged.  Mag 6.6 HD 107947 lies 5.5' NW of center at the edge of the halo and provided a striking contrast although it detracted somewhat from viewing.  A dust lane appeared to pierce the cluster on the north side for a few arc minutes (east of the bright star) and this dark intrusion may be an extension of the "Dark Doodad" (see notes).


18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this large, loose globular was well-resolved into ~100 stars mag 12-15 with a 12' diameter.  The roundish core is ~4' in size with many faint stars sprinkled across the core.  The halo is elongated and irregular in shape. A starless dark lane appears to wind into the cluster towards the core from the NW side angling roughly NW-SE (later verified on the DSS).  A mag 6.8 star lies 5' NW of the core and interferes with viewing!  Located 44' SW of mag 3.8 Gamma Muscae.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): faint, low surface brightness glow with no core. Attached to the south of a mag 6.6 star that is close to the end of the "Dark Doodad".


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4372 = D 67 = h3390 on 30 Apr 1826 using his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector from Parramatta, NSW.  He described "a star of the 6th magnitude, with a beautiful well-defined milky ray proceeding from it south following; the ray is conical, and the star appears in the point of the cone, and the broad or south following extremity is circular, or rounded off. The ray is about 7' in length, and nearly 2' in breadth at the broadest part, near the southern extremity. With the sweeping power this appears like a star with a very faint milky ray south following, the ray gradually spreading in breadth from the star, and rounded off at the broader end. But with a higher power it is not a star with a ray, but a very faint nebula, and the star is not involved or connected with it: I should call it a very faint nebula of a long oval shape, the smaller end towards the star; this is easily resolvable into extremely minute points or stars, but I cannot discover the slightest indications of attraction or condensation towards any part of it. I certainly had not the least suspicion of this object being resolvable when I discovered it with the sweeping power, nor even when I examined it a second time; it is a beautiful object, of a uniform faint light."  Dunlop's position is 24' too far WNW (a fairly large error), but the mag 6.6 star near the NW edge clinches the identification.  His sketch is shown in Fig. 2 of his catalogue.


John Herschel described it (1 Apr 1835) as "a globular cluster, very faint; large; very gradually brighter in the middle; 6' diameter; resolved into stars of 15th magnitude; rich in stars; a delicate and faint object; has a star 45 N.p., distance 5' from centre. Almost perfectly insulated in a very large space almost entirely devoid of stars, being the smaller and southern lacuna below the great 'coal sack'."

NGC 4373 is the brightest in a subgroup of at least 7 galaxies on the northwest side of the Centaurus Cluster (AGC 3526), including IC 3290 and IC 3370.  IC 3290, just 2' SW of NGC 4373, appeared faint, fairly small, round, 25" diameter.  It seems odd that John Herschel missed this galaxy.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4373 = h3391 on 8 Jun 1834 and logged "pB; S; R; pgvmbM."  His position is accurate.  Joseph Turner sketched the galaxy on 16 Apr 1877 (p. 136 of his logbook) with the 48" Melbourne Telescope and also discovered IC 3290, though he never announced the discovery and Lewis Swift, who rediscovered it in 1898, was credited in the IC.

Charles Messier is credited with the discovery of M84 = NGC 4374 = h1237 on 18 Mar 1781, along with M86, and described a "Nebula without star, in Virgo; the center it is a bit brilliant, surrounded with a slight nebulosity: its brightness and its appearance resemble that of those in this Catalog, No.s 59 & 60."  But Wolfgang Steinicke recently found (email Oct '16) that Johann Gottfried Koehler made the original discovery on 5 May 1779 using a Dolland refractor of 6-ft focal length.

This galaxy is not listed in the GC (JH missed the discovery announcement in Schönfeld's "Beobachtungen von Nebelflecken und Sternhaufen") but Dreyer added it to the GSC (5644).  Engelhardt measured an accurate micrometric position.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4390 = H III-39 on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 174) and noted "vF; near some bright stars."  His re-reduced position is 5' northeast of UGC 7519, though the nearest stars as bright as mag 10 and 11 are roughly 10' away.  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position on 3 nights and noted the discrepancy of 20 sec in RA and 2.9' in declination, so he wasn't certain if it was the same object.  Dreyer used d'Arrest's mean position in the NGC.


Schwassmann "rediscovered" this galaxy on a Heidelberg plate in 1900 and it was catalogued again as Sn. 155 (later IC 3320).  Apparently he was unaware of the NGC identification (a number of his objects have NGC designations) and Dreyer missed the equivalence.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4392 = H III-729 = h1249 on 27 Apr 1788 (sweep 833) and noted "vF, S."  Caroline's reduction is within 1' of CGCG 244-012 = PGC 40499.  John Herschel made the single observation, "F; S; R; vgbM.  RA from II. 749 [NGC 4389], which it follows 10 sec."  But NGC 4392 is west of NGC 4389 by 17 sec of RA (3' north of JH's position), so there must have been some confusion.  JH used his position in the GC and Dreyer followed, so the NGC position is poor.  As a result, Curtis reportd in the 1918 "Descriptions of 762 Nebulae and Clusters Photographed with the Crossley Reflector", "There is nothing in just this position, though there are several small nebulae near."  He did finger the correct galaxy, though: "The NGC description accords best with a very small, moderately bright oval 9' n: and 2' w. of 4389."

17.5" (5/15/99): this chaotic galaxy is dominated by several bright HII regions. At 100x, the large low surface brightness glow is clearly clumpy with a couple of faint knots evident on the east side of the haze. At 220x, the glow of the galaxy is more difficult to view and several nonstellar knots and a couple of very faint superimposed stars are more prominent. The brightest HII region is NGC 4401 located 2' SE of the core, ~25" in size, with a second smaller 15" knot (NGC 4400) close south. The core of the galaxy appears as an ill-defined, low surface brightness glow, larger than the individual HII knots.  A mag 14.5 star is superimposed NE of the core. On the SW side of the core is a third difficult knot, about 15" in diameter (NGC 4399) requiring averted vision to confirm.  Member of the M94 Group (CVn I Cloud).


17.5": faint, very large, extremely low surface brightness, must use low magnification to view.  Three knots are involved (one of these observed "knots" may be the core) within a very diffuse glow.  The brightest knot (NGC 4401) is at the SE end about 2' SE of center with NGC 4400 close SSW of NGC 4401.  A mag 14.5 star is at the north end.  Also see description for NGC 4399.


13.1" (4/12/86): at 62x appears very large, diffuse, slightly elongated glow, broad very weak concentration.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4395 = H V-29.1 = h1252 on 2 Jan 1786 (sweep 508) and recorded "eF, vL, vlbM, resolvable, about 10' long and 8 or 9' broad."  JH made two observations, logging on 29 Apr 1827, "two nebulae running into one another; both eF, vL, the f rather the brighter. Place that of the preceding."  Dreyer catalogued the two components as NGC 4395 = V 29.1 and NGC 4401 = V 29.2.  On a second observation, JH wrote "vL; extremely ill defined, may perhaps be 10' l, 3' br; pslbM to an irregular centre.  On closer inspection bicentral; pos of the nuclei 30° np; dist 2'."


This galaxy was viewed on three occasions at Birr Castle by Bindon Stoney, who recorded "a cluster of nebulae found" on 13 Apr 1850 and "there are 4 nebulae.  The 3 f ones seem to be inv in a mass of F neby."  Based on these observations, Dreyer included two additional entries: NGC 4399 and NGC 4400. The sketch of these condensations match up well with my own observations with a 17.5" and can be identified on the POSS.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4398 on 19 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His single position corresponds with a mag 13.8 star and his description of two mag 11/13 stars (closer to mag 10/11.5) that precede by 11.6 sec and 16.35 sec of time is a perfect match.  d'Arrest was uncertain if his object was the same as WH's III-39, and noted the descrepancy in declination.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 4399, along with NGC 4400, on 13 Apr 1850, while observing NGC 4395.  On 14 Apr 1855, R.J. Mitchell noted "there are 4 nebulae.  The 3 following ones seem to be involved in a mass of faint nebulosity.  A sketch shows 4 "nebulae" along with a couple of stars.  One of these (furthest north on the sketch) is the core of NGC 4395 and the other three (NGC 4399, NGC 4400 and NGC 4401) are HII knots in the galaxy.  John Herschel recorded NGC 4401, the brightest of the knots.


Francis Pease assigned NGC 4399 to the knot identified here as NGC 4400 in his 1920 paper on nebulae photographed with the Mt Wilson 60-inch.  Corwin lists the position for NGC 4399 as 12 25 42.8 +33 30 57, which is just following a mag 15 star.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent with the description "Part of NGC 4395."

24" (4/28/14): at 260x appeared extremely bright, very large, oval 3:2 NW-SE, 4.5'x3.0'.  Sharply concentrated with a very intensely bright core that increases down to the center.  The halo increases in size with averted and gradually fades out at the periphery.  Brightest galaxy in the central core of the Virgo cluster.

The outer halo gradually brightens then dramatically increases to a very intense 45" core that increases down to a stellar nucleus.  The nucleus is fairly well defined as a 20" brighter inner zone.  A mag 14.6 star is at the ENE edge of the halo, 2.0' from center.  Brighter of a 17' pair with M84 in the core of the Virgo cluster.


17.5" (4/25/87): very bright, fairly large, slightly elongated 4:3 NW-SE, 4'x3', intense core, substellar nucleus, large diffuse halo.  One of the two brightest galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster along with M84 17' W.  NGC 4402 lies 10' N.


13.1" (5/14/83): very bright, larger and more elongated than M84.


Charles Messier is credited with the discovery of M86 = NGC 4406 = h1253 on 18 Mar 1781, along with M84, and described a "Nebula without star, in Virgo, on the parallel and very near to the nebula above, No. 84: their appearances are the same, & both appear together in the same field of the telescope."  But Wolfgang Steinicke recently found (email Oct '16) that Johann Gottfried Koehler made the original discovery on 5 May 1779.  WH only recorded it on 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 199) and simply noted "B.  Is No. 74 of the Connoissance des Temps." JH listed M86 as a "Nova", probably due to the poor positions of his father.  On sweep 22 he logged "vB; R; gbM to nearly a star" and on sweep 243 "vB; L; pgmbM; r."

John Herschel discovered NGC 4407 = h1255 on 4 May 1829 and simply noted "the following of 2" with h1244 = NGC 4388.  There is nothing at his approximate position, but the description for NGC 4388 mentions the second nebula follows by roughly 30 sec in RA.  NGC 4413 follows by 47 sec in RA and is the only reasonable candidate nearby.  This identification was suggested by Frost, based on Harvard plates and Harold Corwin concurs NGC 4407 = NGC 4413.

A diffuse but uneven glow encompasses the star, with the very weak core just east of the star.  The halo has a very low surface brightness and it was difficult to estimate the diameter.


Forms a pair with (similar) low surface brightness NGC 4411B 4.4' ENE.  It appeared faint or fairly faint, fairly large, round, low surface brightness, weak concentration, ~1.6' diameter.  The halo fades out gradually with no distinct edge (increases in size with averted vision) but doesn't reach a mag 13 star off the northwest edge (1.3' from center).


CGCG 070-087, located 11' NE, appeared fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 24"x15", sharply concentrated with a brighter 15" core that gradually increases to the center and very low surface brightness extensions.  A mag 9.5 star (HD 108384) is 1.2' NE.


17.5" (3/24/90): very faint, round, fairly small, very diffuse glow.  Unusual appearance as a mag 13 star is superimposed on the core and the galaxy appears as a low surface brightness halo surrounds this star.  Forms a close pair with NGC 4411B 4' ENE.


Christian Peters discovered NGC 4411 around 1881 with the 13.5-inch refractor at Hamilton College Observatory.  His position matches UGC 7537 (generally known as NGC 4411A).  Arnold Schwassmann rediscovered the galaxy on a Heidelberg plate in 1900 and assumed it was new.  Dreyer missed the nearly identical positions, so IC 3339 is another designation. Gerard de Vaucouleurs used the letter suffix NGC 4411A in the 1964 "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies".


When Bigourdan observed the field, he found B. 298, which was described as "very large and diffuse, about 2.5' dia, slbM.  Could be NGC 4411 with an error of 17 sec in RA."  In the IC 2 notes Dreyer mentions this is probably the same as NGC 4411, but B. 298 refers to NGC 4411B = UGC 7546, situated 4.5' east-northeast.  Because of Dreyer's error, this galaxy did not receive an IC designation.  See Corwin's notes for more on the story.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4435 = H I-28.1 = h1274, along with NGC 4438, on 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 199) and recorded "two bright, considerably large nebula. One is 86 of the Connois des Temps."  His single position matches the pair NGC 4435/4438 and was confused about the position of M86.  He made the same mistake on 8 Apr 1784, though it that case his positions fall close to NGC 4458/4461 (if he viewed NGC 4435/4438 instead, his position was 17' off).  John Herschel repeated this error in the Slough catalogue, but in the GC JH split the pair into  h1274 = H 1-28.1 (NGC 4435) and h1275 = H 1-28.2 (NGC 4438).


NGC 4435 and 4438 was nicknamed "The Eyes" by Leyland S. Copeland (first author of the Deep Sky Wonders column) in a February 1955 article titled "Adventures in the Virgo Cloud."; the likeness to a pair of eyes is emphasized by the fact that NGC 4435 and 4438 are both elongated in a SSW-NNE direction.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 4443 on 13 Apr 1840 while observing the central region of the Virgo cluster.  He simply noted "F, S" and labeled this object "Kappa" and on the diagram of the field.  No positions were measured, but the sketch places this object close to the NGC 4458/4461 pair.


Frost reported NGC 4443 not found in the Virgo-Coma survey (Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1) and Reinmuth also reported a negative result.  Harold Corwin suggests NGC 4443 may be a duplicate discovery of NGC 4461 (despite missing fainter NGC 4458), and I agree.  See Corwin's notes for story.

48" (2/20/12, 3/1/19, 5/1/19): NGC 4449 is a boxy-shaped Magellanic-type Irregular containing several bright, giant HII regions that are sites of active star formation.  The galaxy has been intensively studied as one of the strongest galaxy-wide starbursts in the nearby universe.  The overall surface brightness of the galaxy was unusually high at 375x.  The very bright central region is elongated SW-NE, irregular in surface brightness and contains a small, intense "nucleus".  This object is identified in SIMBAD as [GHG2001] 1 and described as a 10 Myr old super star cluster in the 2001 study by Gelatt et al, "The Star Clusters in the Irregular Galaxy NGC 4449".


To the southwest is a fairly large, bright patch that mimics a second core.  This region is catalogued as #27/28/30 in Hodge-Kennicutt's 1983 "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies" [HK83].  Several addition patches are on the north end of the galaxy.  The largest and brightest is #15, a high surface brightness irregular glow at the north end of the galaxy, 20"x12", with a mottled surface and a stellar knot (#11) at the north tip.  Roughly 35" SW is #25, a moderately bright roundish knot of ~12" diameter.  20" W is #31, a fairly faint, small HII knot, less than 10" in diameter.  At the northeast tip of the galaxy is #2, nearly 1' SE of #15.  It appeared as a moderately bright knot, ~15"-20" in size.  A small knot (#16) was noted on the southeast side of the galaxy. A faint 12" knot is nearly detached at the SW end of galaxy (#6 in the 1969 "Kinematic study of ionized hydrogen in NGC 4449").  Very low surface brightness haze extends west off the SW end. A mag 14 star is superimposed [44" ENE of the nucleus].


On 5/1/19, I had the strong impression of an extremely low surface brightness glow nearly 10' SE of the galaxy (and 2.4' W of LEDA 2233323). This is the location of a tidal star stream, discovered in 2011.


18" (5/14/07): very mottled, irregular appearance, elongated ~2:1 SW-NE, ~5'x2.5'.  The core is quite splotchy in appearance with a couple of bright knots; the most prominent is attached to the southwest of the core.  The main body is roughly rectangular with an extension at the northwest "corner" that ends with a bright knot or knots ([HK83] #15).  Another extension or knot ([HK83] #2) is off the northeast corner.  A mag 13 star lies 2.4' E of the core and 1 or 2 additional very faint stars or knots are superimposed in the central region.


18" (5/8/04): fascinating view of this "Magellanic" system at 323x!  The galaxy is very irregular in appearance and surface brightness with a large, bright, elongated core oriented SW-NE.  The core appears offset to the south side of the galaxy.


Several knots (giant HII regions) are visible outside the core.  The brightest is a well-defined obvious patch on the north edge of the galaxy, 1.5' from the center.  This object is #15 in Hodge-Kennicutt's 1983 "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies" ([HK83]) and it is nearly comparable in surface brightness to the core.  Roughly 1' SE is #2, a smaller, faint knot that is collinear with #15 and a mag 13.5 star 2.4' E of the core.  #25, a third difficult knot, can sometimes be glimpsed about 40" SW of #15.  Finally, attached on the south end of the core is a larger, bright knot, although initially I thought this was just part of the core.


13.1" (4/12/86): very bright, very large, elongated SW-NE, bright core, stellar nucleus.  A knot is involved at the north end and the galaxy generally appears brighter to the north of the core.  A star is superimposed close east of the core.


8": bright, moderately large, elongated, bright core.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4449 = H I-213 = h1281 on 27 Apr 1788 (sweep 833) and recorded "very brilliant, cL, E from sp to nf, difficulty r, seems to have 3 or 4 B nuclei."  His sketch at the end of 1811 PT paper (reproduced in Stenicke's book) clearly shows 4 condensations or HII knots within the glow, though one of these may be the nucleus.  He used this an illustration of "Nebulae which are brighter in more the one Place."  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Caroline Herschel was next to find the object on 8 Jul 1793 in her 4.2-inch reflector, "and assumed it to be a comet!"


On sweep 150, John Herschel recorded "B; L; gbM; E in pos 75° nf to sp, a fine cluster; well resolved; I see several of the stars; 3' l, 2' br."  On sweep 248 (last of 4 observations), JH wrote "vF; vL; vmE; it is either a double nebula or the nf end is bifid.  If double the companion is F; R; bM; nearly north 1.5' or 2'.  A fine object."  So, clearly WH and JH resolved several HII regions in this galaxy.  Lord Rosse or assistant Johnston Stoney noted on 17 Mar 1849, "3 nuclei or 2 nuclei and star, and faint neb outlying."


Based on photographs taken with the 60-inch reflector at Mt Wilson, Francis Pease (1917) described NGC 4449 as "..an irregular nebulous mass in which many nebulous stars [HII regions] are distributed unevenly.  The greater part of the nebula is roughly rectangular, about 4.5'x2.5', p.a. = 40°, there being an assemblage of some dozen nebulous stars W of the SW corner.  On the original negative there are 230 nebulous stars or patches...Two-thirds of them are in the N half.  The nebulosity proper is weak toward the edge, gradually increases inward, and culminates along a central ridge, where it is as strong as the stars themselves.  A number of dark irregular rifts appear here and there in it."

He recorded it again a week later on sweep 182 as "pL, r, bM", measured an accurate position, and noted this nebula was observed in sweep 170.  But his next entry (H II-90) was placed 1.0 min following and there is only one galaxy here, so he must have recorded NGC 4450 a second time in the sweep!

William Herschel discovered NGC 4453 = H II-26 = h1283? on 28 Jan 1784 (the only nebula discovered on sweep 131) and recorded "pB, not vS.  It is not cometic.  The brightest part of it lies towards the following side.  I suppose it to be resolveable."  Dreyer noted this sweep was problematic ("unsatisfactory") with possible confusion with the offset star.  There is no object at WH's position and it was not found visually by Bigourdan or photographically by Wolf.  Dreyer suggested that if WH made an error of 20' in PD, that II-26 might be II-146 (NGC 4430).


JH, though, found h1283 = PGC 41072 44 sec of RA east of II-26 and this may be the intended object.  However, Harold Corwin argues that H II-26 cannot be h1283 due to the significant difference in description (h1283 was called "eF").  He concludes "I'm leaning toward adopting NGC 4430 as II 26, though with considerable uncertainty."

His position was very uncertain and only roughly found, but the description clearly applies to NGC 4467 and the nearby star.  On 28 Dec 1785, he observed what he assumed was the same object (internal discovery #44), but the second observation probably refers to H. II 18 = NGC 4466.  As a result, NGC 4467 wasn't assigned an H-designation.


Otto Struve independently discovered NGC 4467 on 28 Apr 1851 with the 15-inch Merz refractor at the Pulkovo Observatory while observing M49.  He wrote, "Near this last star [preceding M49 by 17 seconds of time] , there is still another smaller nebula at a distance of 2 to 3 seconds, located on the straight line joining the star with the main nebula."  Struve is credited with the discovery in the NGC.  d'Arrest measured an accurate position (3 nights) and credited Struve with the discovery.

17.5" (4/25/87): faintest of three with NGC 4474 5.5' ENE and NGC 4459 8.7' SW.  Faint, fairly small, slightly elongated ~E-W, small weak concentration.


13.1" (5/14/83): faint, small, diffuse, slightly elongated, no noticeable concentration.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4468 = H II-630 on 14 Jan 1787 (sweep 691) and simply noted "cL".  His position is 5' south and 14 tsec west of UGC 7628, but it was observed in the sweep between NGC 4459 and NGC 4474, and this is the only galaxy between these two.  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position at Copenhagen as well as Rudolph Spitaler in 1891 at the Vienna Observatory.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4469 = H II-157 on 15 Apr 1784 (sweep 194) and recorded "F, pL, mE, r."  His position is 4.5' north of UGC 7622.  Édouard Stephan independently found NGC 4469 on 28 Apr 1884 and reported it as new in his 13th discovery list (#70).  But he caught the prior discovery immediately as a footnote was added that #70 referred to H. II 157 = GC 3019, though Herschel's position was off by 5' in polar distance.

William Herschel found NGC 4470 = H II-498 = h1293 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) and logged "F, pL".  He assumed it was new and assigned the H-designation II-498.  His position is a good match with UGC 7627.  He discovered this galaxy on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 105) and recorded II-19 = NGC 4610 as "south of and a rectangles to the great Nebula [M49] and the small star near it; Is a nebula incomparably more faint.  My field takes them both in together."   But his position was poorly determined (not uncommon in his early sweeps_, so he did not realize the equivalence.  JH made two observations, though his descriptions are so disparate ("B" on sweep 117 and "vF" on sweep 251), they may refer to NGC 4470 and NGC 4466, respectively.  Julius Schmidt made an independent discovery on 29 Jun 1861 and announced it in AN 1513 (1866), but Heinrich d'Arrest noted the earlier discovery and measured an accurate position (7 nights).


In the NGC, Dreyer equated II-18 = II-498 = NGC 4470 and assigned II-19 = NGC 4610.  But in his 1912 Scientific Paper of WH, Dreyer correctly sorts out the identification based on WH's description and sketch and concludes II-19 = II-498 = NGC 4470.  So, NGC 4470 = NGC 4610.

48" (5/15/12): this number applies to one of two 14th magnitude stars at 1' separation oriented NNW-SSE, situated ~6' SSW of M49.  VCC 1203, a fairly faint galaxy (too faint to have been seen by Schmidt), lies 1.5' NW of the NNW star.


Julius Schmidt discovered NGC 4471 on 29 Jun 1861 near M49 with the 6.2" refractor at the Athens Observatory.  He also found NGC 4470, 4492 and 4464, which had all been discovered earlier by WH.  There is nothing at his position in AN 1513 (1866) except a 14th magnitude star and neither Heinrich d'Arrest nor Guillaume Bigourdan could recover Schmidt's object.


Karl Reinmuth refers to a possible candidate as "vS, R, = neb *13.5; eF vs iR neb np 1.7', *13.5 ssf 1.0'."  His description applies to a faint star at 12 29 40.6 +07 54 40.  Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 paper on Corrections to the NGC, identified NGC 4471 as a star (from Ames in Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1 (Virgo-Coma survey) and this is repeated in the RNGC.  Corwin identifies NGC 4471 with one of two 14th magnitude stars near the NGC position.  SIMBAD (and others) misidentify VCC 1203 = PGC 41185 as NGC 4471.

48" (5/15/12): at 488x, M49 appeared extremely bright and large, slightly elongated N-S, ~6'x5', fades gradually so the outer extent may be larger.  Well concentrated with an intense core that is sharply concentrated with a brilliant nucleus.  A mag 12 star is superimposed 45" E of center.  A number of galaxies (see below) surround the halo, including NGC 4467 4' W and NGC 4465 5.9' WNW.  A mag 13 star is 4.6' W of center (close to NGC 4467).


VCC 1199, 4.5' NW of center, appeared faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.


VCC 1203, 4.6' SSW of center, is fairly faint, fairly small, round, 12" diameter, slightly brighter core.  VCC 1203 is misidentified as NGC 4471 in SIMBAD.  The NGC number probably applies to one of the two faint stars ~2' SE.


UGC 7636, 5.4' SE of center, is very faint, fairly small, elongated patch, ~0.5'x0.3' N-S, with a very low surface brightness and no concentration.  This blue, dwarf irregular companion (Arp called it a "fragment") has been disrupted by M49 with H I gas stripped in a tidal tail.


17.5" (4/18/87): very bright, fairly large, sharp concentration to a compact very bright nucleus, large halo slightly elongated ~N-S fades at the edges.  A mag 12 star is superimposed at the east edge 0.8' from center.  A faint galaxy NGC 4467 lies 5' W.


Charles Messier discovered M49 = NGC 4472 = H I-7 = h1294 on 19 Feb 1771 (first Virgo cluster member discovered).  Oriani Independently found it on 22 Apr 1779 while following a comet that passed through the Virgo cluster.  Admiral Smyth confused these discovery dates, causing later confusion on the primary discoverer.


William Herschel first recorded M49 on 23 Jan 1784 (early sweep 105) and described I-7 as "A beautiful nebula.  Not cometic.  It is visible in the finder and vB in the telescope", but his RA was 11 min too large.  On 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) he called M49 "vB, cL, gmbM, extended with F branches."  John Herschel made 5 observations, recording on sweep 253, "eB; L; R psmbM; insensibly fading away, has a * 13m following; by diag the star is just beyond the nebula." Heinrich d'Arrest claimed he resolved the cluster and saw "countless groups of stars; at 147x, the nebula periphery can be resolved into stars of the 13th and 14th magnitudes."

Heinrich d'Arrest independently found NGC 4473 and 4477 on 29 Mar 1856, unaware of WH's prior discovery.  JH responded in an open letter to Hind that both of d'Arrest's "novae" were seen earlier and that he was surprised d'Arrest missed NGC 4479.  This caused some controversy whether NGC 4479 was a "variable" nebula.

Heinrich d'Arrest independently found NGC 4473 and 4477 on 29 Mar 1856, but missed NGC 4479.  John Herschel was surprised that d'Arrest missed NGC 4479 as it was in the same field as NGC 4477 and a class II nebula.  He wrote a letter to John Russell Hind (as possibly another variable nebula), which was reprinted in 1862 MNRAS, Vol. 22, p.250 titled "Sir John Herschel to Mr. Hind, on the Disappearance of a Nebula in Coma Berenices".  He was 70 years old at the time and decades past being an active observer. Jean Chacornac, Schönfeld and Lassell, reading about the supposed missing nebula, also confirmed the visibility of NGC 4479.  Eventually d'Arrest observed this galaxy on 5 May 1862 using the 11-inch Copenhagen refractor.

I was very surprised by the length and the extreme thinness, appearing like a narrow laser beam shooting out of the core, ~20"x2"!

When the seeing was sharp, there was a brighter, knot (stellar) at the outer tip that sometimes appeared detached.  There was a strong impression of a second stellar knot within the spike.


48" (4/1/11): at 488x, the jet in M87 was immediately noticed as a short, faint spike poking out of the central core to the WNW and the position angle [290-300°] was accurately sketched without prior knowledge.  The narrow jet brightened or there was a knot at the outer tip.


In addition to looking for the jet, I sketched three companions at the edge of the outer halo on the southwest side. About 2' SW of the center of M87 is a pair of very faint, roundish galaxies, both ~15" diameter.  The pair forms UGC 7652 with the components separated by 40" and nearly aligned with the center of the galaxy as if they were ejected.  2MASX J12303903+1222222, an extremely faint companion (V = 17.9), lies 2.8' WSW of the core, just 20" SE of a mag 15.5 star.  The three close "companions" to M87 are actually part of a distant, poor cluster in the background of M87, with a redshift of 20x that of M87!


Virgo UCD 3 is either one of the brightest globular clusters in M87 or a nucleated dwarf galaxy, called a Ultra-Compact Dwarf (UCD).  It is situated just 3.0' NE of the center of M87, directly opposite the two small galaxies at the southwest edge of the halo of M87.  A mag 14.5 star, just 20" SSW, is a perfect reference to focus on the cluster.  On 4/16/13 using 488x it was suspected as an 18th magnitude "star", but I didn't feel confident of the observation.  At 813x, though, it was confirmed as an extremely faint, stellar object, glimpsed several times at the same position.


24" (5/29/14): extremely bright, large, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, ~4'x3.5', well concentrated with a large, intense core.  The core brightens but there was no distinct nucleus.  The halo gradually fades and increases in size with averted vision.  Several galaxies are nearby including NGC 4486B 7.2' NW, NGC 4486A 7.6' SSE, NGC 4478 8.7' SW and NGC 4476 12.6' WSW.


17.5" (5/23/87): very bright, fairly large, gradually increases to a very bright core, no sharp nucleus.  A very compact galaxy NGC 4486A = UGC 7658 lies 7' S.


13.1" (5/14/83): very bright, intense core, fairly smooth halo.


Charles Messier is credited with the discovery of M87 = NGC 4486 = h1301 on 18 Mar 1781.  But Wolfgang Steinicke recently found (email Oct '16) that Johann Gottfried Koehler made the original discovery on 5 May 1779.  On 17 Apr 1784 (sweep 199), WH logged "Three nebulae, the two first [NGC 4476 and 4478] vF, S, the third [M87], B, L, mbM but diminishing very gradually in brightness."  JH made at least 5 observations, recording on sweep 245, "vB; vL; R; psmbM; r; 3' diam."


M87 is one of the most distant galaxies (~52 million light years) visible in binoculars.  It contains a 6.4-billion-solar-mass black hole (1,000 times more massive than Sgr A).  The 20" jet was discovered by Heber Curtis at Lick Observatory in 1918 and described as a "curious straight ray lies in a gap in the nebulosity in pa 20°, apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter. The ray is brightest at the inner end, which is 11" from the nucleus."


A supernova (1919A) was found in 1922 by Russian astronomer Balnowski on a plate taken 24 Feb 1919.

48" (5/1/19): at 375x; several HII knots were identified along the north side of this remarkable galaxy. NGC 4490:[VS65] 19, 22 and 23 are three very close, tiny knots oriented WNW-ESE [total length 22"] along the north edge of the central region.  The middle knot (#22) was the brightest but only ~6" and the last knot (#23) was the faintest. NGC 4490:[VS65] 02 was a fairly bright, elongated glow on the NW edge of the galaxy [1.8' from center]. On close inspection it resolved into two extremely small knots. These designations are from 1965 study of HII regions in NGC 2403, 2903 and 4485/4490 by Véron and Sauvayre.


24" (5/27/17): very bright, large, elongated ~5:2 WNW-ESE, ~5'x2.2', fairly high but irregular surface brightness, brighter core, but seems offset from center.  A long arm (somewhat detached from the brighter central region), sweeps WNW and curls north near the end (bending towards companion NGC 4485).  Fascinating unusual structure.


18" (6/7/08): I viewed this interesting pair in my 15x50 IS binoculars (just a faint blur), 18" Starmaster (disturbed arm on the WNW end extending towards NGC 4490 easily visible) and the 33.4" f/5 (internal structure visible).


18" (6/13/07): very bright, large, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, ~5'x2', with a very bright oval core, ~45"x30".  The surface brightness is irregular or mottled but most interesting is a small extension or arm that juts out of the WNW end and appears to bend or hook north towards the companion NGC 4485.  There appears to be a smaller counterpart at the ESE end that slightly protrudes from the main body.  With averted vision, the galaxy grows wider and appears ~5'x2.5'.  Located 39' NW of mag 4.3 Beta CVn.  Member of the CVn II Group (brightest member M106).


18" (6/4/05): very bright, large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, contains a large, bright core.  At the northwest end a faint arm appears to emerge hooking sharply to the north for 1' towards NGC 4485.  At the southeast end, there appears to be slight extension without much curvature near a 16th magnitude star.  The central region is weakly concentrated to the center.  Overall, the galaxy has a mottled, slightly splotchy appearance as if was dusty or knotty with HII regions.  Located 40' NW of 4.2-magnitude Beta Canum Venaticorum.


13.1" (2/16/85): very bright, large, striking, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 6'x3', large bright core is elongated and grainy.  A very faint arm extends from the NW end in the direction of NGC 4485 3.6' NNW.  A small extension (arm) at the SE end is suspected.  Similar view and sketch made on 2/23/85.  On 4/12/86, just a hint of curvature was noted towards NGC 4485.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4490 = H I-198 = h1308, along with NGC 4485, on 14 Jan 1788 (sweep 798) and recorded "Two, the most south [NGC 4490] vB, vL, iE.  That to the north B, pS, iF, about 1 1/2' distance."  JH logged "vB; vL; mE; 40° np to sf; easily resolvable."


An accurate sketch was made of NGC 4485 and 4490 at Birr Castle on 27 Mar 1856 (figure 23, Plate XXVII in the 1861 publication).  It showed the northwest tip curling towards NGC 4485 and a faint streak, corresponding to a string of HII regions, along the north edge of the galaxy.

Julius Schmidt independently found NGC 4492 in June 1861 with the 6" refractor at the Athens Observatory and announced it (along with both NGC 4464 and NGC 4470) in AN 1513 (1866).  All three of these objects, though, were found previously by Herschel.  In addition, Arnold Schwassmann found this galaxy again in 1900 on a plate taken with the 6" astrograph at the Königstuhl Observatory in Heidelberg.  He assumed Sn. 65 was new (on a different plate he correctly identified Sn. 64 as NGC 4492) and Dreyer recatalogued Sn. 65 as IC 3438 although the NGC and IC positions are virtually identical.  So, NGC 4492 = IC 3438.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4496 = H II-36 = h1309 on 23 Feb 1784 (sweep 158) and recorded "a faintish pL nebula.  It seems to be resolveable."  John Herschel made three observations and resolved this double system on the 7 Apr 1828: "A double nebula; vF; pL; both R; pos 45° sf by diag; the two are in contact; unequal."  The three editions of the Reference Catalouge of Bright Galaxies label the two components as NGC 4496A and 4496B.


R.J. Mitchell sketched and described this system on 18 Apr 1855 at Birr Castle, "A double neb, alpha [NGC 4496B] is vF, and its light flickering, the other [NGC 4496A] has F neby extending a good way downwards [north], and is much the larger and brighter of the two."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4505 = H III-18 = h1315 on 23 Feb 1784 (sweep 158) and recorded "vF of a considerable size; it seems to be resolvable, is more faint than the foregoing [II-36 = NGC 4496] and rather larger.  There is nothing at his position, exactly 1.0 min of time following II-36 = NGC 4496, and the description applies to this galaxy!  It appears he likely recorded the same object twice.


JH has a single observation on sweep 142: "eF, the following of 2 [with NGC 4496] in fld."  His position is roughly the same as his father's (perhaps using his working list).  Karl Reinmuth, in his photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", questions if it is a mag 14 star, and this is very possible.

John Herschel discovered NGC 4507 = h3399 on 5 Jun 1834 and recorded "pB; S; R: psmbM to a * 16m."  His position (measured on two sweeps) is at the east edge of ESO 322-029 = PGC 41960.  He must have made an error precessing the position to 1860 coordinates in the GC, as the position there (copied into the NGC) was 3.0 min of RA too far west.  As a result, Joseph Turner couldn't find this galaxy when he searched for it with the Great Melbourne Telescope in 1878.


The identication with NGC 4507 was missed in the 1932 Shapley-Ames Catalogue and this galaxy was listed as one of 6 "new anonymous" galaxies (New 2).

John Herschel discovered NGC 4508 = h1317 on 19 Apr 1830 and noted "vF; R; a * 13m with a burr."  His position corresponds with a close, faint double star.  The stars are cleanly resolved on the SDSS.  Karl Reinmuth also identifies a double star at the NGC position, although he also mentions a possible nearby candidate.  This is object #1450 in the Ames "Catalogue of 2778 Nebulae including the Coma-Virgo Group".  Ames felt this object was too far from the NGC position and too faint.

See observing notes for NGC 4521.  Identification uncertain; this number may be identical to NGC 4510.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4512 = h1321 on 3 Apr 1832 and recorded "pB; R: psbM; 20"."  There is nothing at his single position, though 10' north-northeast is UGC 7700, the galaxy identified in all modern catalogues as NGC 4512.  But this galaxy would not be described as "pB", as it has a very low surface brightness.  In addition, JH made no mention of much brighter NGC 4521, just 4' north of UGC 7770, which was seen on the previous sweep with a poor position.


Bigourdan was unable to recover NGC 4512 and Reinmuth states "no pB neb found, =NGC 4521?"   Corwin suggests that NGC 4512 may be identical to NGC 4510 as this would require a 30' error in declination.  Furthermore this galaxy is more likely than NGC 4521 to be called "round" and "20" in diameter.  So, the identification with NGC 4521 is uncertain, but likely applies to either NGC 4521 or NGC 4510.  See Corwin's identification notes.

48" (5/4/16): beautiful edge-on spiral, nearly 8:1 WSW-ENE, ~11'x1.5'.  A mag 10.9 star is attached on the north edge, just east of center.  The galaxy is broadly concentrated with a larger, brighter core region and small brighter nucleus.  A fairly prominent, irregular dust lane extends ~5', unevenly slicing the galaxy along the north edge of the core region.  The absorption lane is widest and most prominent near the core.  A fairly thin strip of the galaxy is visible to the north of the dust lane, passing through the bright star at the north edge.  The dust gives the galaxy an irregular patchy appearance and along with some mottling, the view is reminiscent of NGC 253 or NGC 55.


NGC 4517A, situated 17' NNW, appeared moderately bright, large, oval 4:3 SSW-NNE, ~3'x2.2', broad concentration with a small brighter core, patchy, irregular surface brightness.  A mag 10 star is 3.5' NW and a mag 11.5 star is 4.6' W.


17.5" (3/24/90): moderately bright, very large edge-on 8:1 WSW-ENE, almost 10'x1.2'.  This galaxy is an impressive large narrow streak with fairly low surface brightness and fills 1/2 of the 21' field.  There is no well-define nucleus but central region slightly bulges.  Appears brighter along the western extension.  A mag 9 star is attached at the northeast edge of the core.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4517 = H IV-5 on 22 Feb 1784 (sweep 153) and recorded "A pretty bright star with a milky ray on the south side of it, extending from east to west, or rather from np to sf.  It does not seem to touch the star, and is about 10 or 12' in length."  On a second observation (1 Jan 1786, sweep 507), he added "a pB star with a milky ray to the south of it, and partly including it."  WH commented this might suggest that the nebula had a considerable proper motion, though differences in observing conditions might account for the difference.  The GC and NGC position (from 3 observations) is 0.5 min of RA too far east and 2' south.


JH found h1277 = NGC 4437 on 14 Apr 1828 and recorded "F; vmE; pos 15° nf to sp; a long ray; it is south preceding a * 10m.  The place is that of the star."  There is nothing near his position, but 5 min of RA east is NGC 4517 and his description is a perfect match with this galaxy.  The equivalence may have first been suggest by Karl Reinmuth in his 1926 photographic Heidelberg survey "Die Herschel Nebel".  Various sources (including the RNGC) mistakenly equate NGC 4437 with NGC 4417, instead of NGC 4517.  So, NGC 4517 = NGC 4437.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4526 = H I-31 = H I-38 = h1329 on 13 Apr 1784 (sweep 191) and recorded I-31 as "vB, E, mbM, r."  It is situated between two brilliant stars at a considerable distance."  There is nothing at his position, but 17' north is UGC 7718 = PGC 41772 and his description matches this bright galaxy.  Five nights later (sweep 202), he returned to the field and recorded I-38 as "B, vL, mE, mbM."  His position was only 2' south of UGC 7718.  JH combined the two H-designations in the GC.


WH probably found this galaxy a third time on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) and recorded it as H I-119 = NGC 4560, with another bad position.  So, NGC 4526 = NGC 4560.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4529 = H III-26 on 12 Mar 1784 (sweep 167) and logged "I suspected a L, eF nebula; but though I looked at it a good while I could not verify the suspicion, nor could I convince myself that it was a deception."  The RA was only taken approximately.  He reported it again on 16 Mar 1790 (sweep 944), and measured offsets from 26 Com (the reduced position by CH was used in the GC and NGC).  Dreyer discussed the difference between CH's reduction vs. Auwers' reduction in the NGC Notes/Corrections section (based on the sweep used).  In any case, there is nothing at either position.


RNGC misidentifies MCG +04-30-003 = CGCG 129-006 as NGC 4529, although neither CGCG or MCG uses this identification.  PGC lists the RNGC entry and the MCG/CGCG entry separately, so PGC 41482 = PGC 41463. Malcolm Thomson concurs this a probable misidentification if the original NGC position is correct.


I send an e-mail to Harold Corwin back in October 1999 about the identification and no satisfactory candidate could be identified.  See his identification notes.

John Herschel discovered NGC 4530 = h1332 in May 1828 (sweep 150) and described "8 [Beta] CVn.  Involved in a considerable nebula 3' in diam, exactly R; vgbM." He made a total of four observation and described the star as nebulous on each occasion.  There is no nebulosity surrounding this star.  JH realized the observation was uncertain.  In the appendix of the Slough catalogue, he noted "With regard to nebulous stars generally, I ought to mention that it has frequently occurred to me to notice a peculiar state of atmosphere in which all large stars (above the 7th magnitude) have appeared surrounded with photospheres of 2' or 3' or more diameter, precisely resembling that about some of the finer specimens of nebulous stars."


This is the second brightest star (after NGC 771) with an entry in the NGC.  Albert Marth wrote to Herschel in 1862 that the star "does not appear to me have any nebula or appendage about it."

NGC 4535 = UGC 7727 = MCG +01-32-104 = CGCG 042-159 = PGC 41812 = The Lost Galaxy

V = 10.0;  Size 7.1'x5.0';  Surf Br = 13.7;  PA = 0°


48" (4/4/13): NGC 4535 is a gorgeous face-on Sc spiral with two, long, very prominent arms extending from a small, very bright central region.  The small, very bright core is elongated SSW-NNE and punctuated by an intense, stellar nucleus.  The two main arms are clearly attached right at opposite ends of the core.  At the northeast end, a beautiful thin arm winds clockwise to the west with a mag 13.5 star pinned on the outer north edge.  The arm contains NGC 4535:[HK83] #157 (several additional entries including #141/145 are in Hodge & Kennicutt's "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies"), a small, bright, 15" knot and then dims as it wraps to the south.  A mag 14.5 star is situated midway between the nucleus and southern end of this arm [47" SW of the nucleus].


The second main arm is attached at the southwest end of the core and curves clockwise to the southeast, where the arm brightens in an elongated 30" patch (#51/52/72/78), which is symmetrically positioned opposite #157.  A fainter arm segment, extending WNW to ESE is visible on the south side, containing #84/90, a small, fairly faint 12" patch, located 1.5' SSE of center.  This knot forms the vertex of a flat isosceles triangle with a mag 15 star 0.5' NW and a mag 14 star 0.7' S.  The arms are etched on the slightly fainter and larger background glow of the disc, which extends 5.5'x4.0' in a N-S orientation.


24" (5/24/20): at 260x; bright, large, face-on spiral with a low contrast "S" shape, ~5'x4' N-S. Strongly concentrated with a small bright core elongated N-S and an intense quasi-stellar nucleus.  A mag 14.5 star is superimposed 0.8' SW of center.  The northern arm was very subtle; it curved clockwise to the west, passing close to a mag 13.5 star 1' N of center.  A faint 15" knot, [HK83] #157, was at the end of this arm, 1' NW of center. A low contrast arm on the south side curled towards the east and north.  A mag 15 star is 1.2' S of center (just south of the arm) and a mag 14 star is 2.2' S of center at the edge of the outer halo.


17.5" (4/18/87): bright, fairly large, very small bright core, elongated SSW-NNE, about 5.5'x4.0'.  Appears slightly darker on both sides of core (this is a gap between the spiral arms).  A mag 13.5 star is superimposed on the north side 1.0' from the center and a similar star is at the south end of the halo 2.2' from center.  A faint mag 14.5 star is just 48" SW of the core.  NGC 4526 lies 30' SSW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4535 = H II-500 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) and described "very large, easily resolvable.  I see a few of the largest stars in it."  In his 1814 PT paper, WH hypothesized this object may be a cluster of stars mixed with nebulosity or a cluster seen at great distance which contains no nebulosity.  JH did not make any observations, though d'Arrest made four observations and described it as up to 5 or 6' in size.  He also noted the mag 15 star (called mag 17) just 48" preceding the nucleus.


The nickname "Lost Galaxy" is from Leland S. Copeland's February 1955 S&T article "Adventuring in the Virgo Cloud". In his article, Copeland described a star hop through the Virgo Cluster using his 8" Cave reflector. He states, "North of the Diamond is a very dim spiral, here called the Lost Galaxy, NGC 4535." Leland was probably referring to NGC4535's difficulty to locate due to its low surface brightness.  The a caption of a photograph states that NGC 4535's "delicate structure shows only on long exposure photographs".

48" (4/4/13): very bright, gorgeous showpiece spiral with two very stretched arms extending northwest and southeast ~7'x2.5'.  Contains a very bright, slightly elongated core that increases to an intense stellar nucleus.  One long arm emanates from the west side of the core and shoots to the northwest, extending over 3' from the nucleus.  Close west of the core is a brighter, knotty region identified as [HK 83] 66/67 in the Hodge-Kennicutt "Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies".  The second arm is connected at the northeast side of the core and stretches to the southeast. A small brightening (#53) is just north of the core where the arm is attached.  This arm contains a brighter, elongated section which includes [HK 83] 23/33/35/36, opposite the brighter region on the western arm.


24" (5/24/20): at 260x; bright, very large, very elongated at least 3:1 NW-SE with two long slightly arched arms, ~6.5'x2', strong concentration with a bright elongated core that increased to a very small but non-stellar nucleus.  The long eastern arm was attached on the north side of the core and was brightest in a 1.5'-2' section angling to the SE.  The arm dimmed with a diffuse, lower surface brightness extension out to 3.5' SE of center, spreading further south at the eastern end. The western arm was also brightest in the initial 1' section on the west side of the core. The arm dimmed and thinned but stretched NW ~3' from center, where is seemed to bend north and fade out.


17.5" (3/24/90): fairly bright, very large, very elongated NW-SE, weak concentration, stellar nucleus.  Spiral structure is suspected at the ends of the major axis.  Forms a pair with NGC 4533 8' N.  Located 12' WSW of mag 7.0 SAO 119485 and 12' S of mag 8.6 SAO 119474 (4' N of NGC 4533).  NGC 4527 lies 30' N.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4536 = H V-2 = h1337 on 24 Jan 1784 (sweep 120) and noted "F, L, cE.  It is bright in the middle in two or three places."  He recorded the galaxy on 4 different sweeps.  John Herschel reported "pB; vL; mE in pos 20° np; sbM."


R.J. Mitchell sketched the galaxy on 29 May 1856 with LdR's 72" and clearly showed the central bar and long arms forming an stretched "Z" shape.  The sketch was included (Fig 24) in LdR's 1861 publication.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 4537 = Sw. I-22 on 16 Mar 1884 and recorded "eeF; S; R; nearly between 2 stars."  There is nothing at his position, but 49 seconds of RA due east is NGC 4542 (discovered by John Herschel), the brightest nearby candidate.  Also in the vicinity is MCG +09-21-022 = PGC 41909, 3.2' northeast of NGC 4537 and with respect to Swift's position, 1.0 min of RA east and 2' north.  But this galaxy is substantially fainter (V = 15), and if it was Swift's object, I would assume he would mention brighter NGC 4542.  Either galaxy could be made to fit his comment "nearly between 2 stars."


The RNGC and PGC (and secondary sources such as Megastar) identify MCG +09-21-022 as NGC 4537.  Both Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin concur that NGC 4537 is more likely a duplicate of NGC 4542.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.

18" (5/12/07): this is a very small and close double system oriented NW-SE.  The slightly brighter and larger NW component is very faint, very small, round, 15" diameter while the SE component is extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter.  The pair is cleanly resolved, though the centers are just 27" apart.  MCG +10-18-68 lies 3' NW and NGC 4549 is 4.3' NE.  Located 3.8' WNW of a mag 10.5 star.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4547 = H III-802 = h1344 on 17 Apr 1789 (sweep 923) and logged "vF, lE."  His re-reduced position is just 1.3' northeast of MCG +10-18-069 = PGC 41896.  This is a double system, with III-802 referring to the brighter northwestern component that was likely seen by WH.  A second observation a week later (sweep 926), confirmed the position of III-802, and he also picked up III-807 = NGC 4549 = PGC 41954.  JH made two observations, noting on sweep 345, "pF; pL; E; vgbM; precedes a * 9m."


RNGC and CGCG misidentify the double system as NGC 4547 + NGC 4549.  MCG misidentifies MCG +10-18-068 as NGC 4547 and MCG +10-18-069 as NGC 4549.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for a thorough discussion of the identifications.

24" (5/22/17): at 282x; very bright, large, strongly concentrated with a very bright round core that elongates into a bar oriented WSW-ENE.  The initial portions of spiral arms are attached at both ends of the bar.  On the WSW end, a weak arm extends north, curving slightly counter-clockwise and on the east end, a subtle arm starts to curl south.  Both arms blend into a low surface brightness outer halo that extends ~3.5'x2.5'.


CGCG 099-097 was picked up 6.6' SE of the center of M91.  At 375x it was very faint, small, slightly elongated SW-NE, ~18"x14", low surface brightness.


17.5" (5/23/87): bright, moderately large, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 3'x2', gradually increases to a bright core and a very small nucleus.  M88 is 50' WSW.


Charles Messier discovered M91 = NGC 4548 = H II-120 = h1345 on 18 Mar 1781.  For a long time M91 was a missing Messier object as there is nothing in his position.  In "The Missing Messier Objects" (Sky & Tel Oct 1960), Owen Gingerich concluded that M91 was likely a duplicate observation of M58 (same RA as Messier's position for M91 but differs by 2° in dec). Gingrich noted that M91 had been previously proposed to be a comet (suggested by Harlow Shapley and Helen Davis). But in 1969 Texas amateur William C. Williams of Fort Worth figured out that Messier had determined its position using offsets from M89, though he assumed it was from M58.  Making this correction, the position of M91 matches NGC 4548.


William Herschel independently found this galaxy on 8 Apr 1784 (sweep 187) and recorded H II-120 as "L, resolvable, but moonlight [end of a long night]."  John Herschel made 3 observations, first logging this galaxy on 3 Apr 1826 (sweep 24) as "pB; R; bM; 60" [diameter]."

18" (5/12/07): extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter, required averted vision to glimpse, though transparency was very mediocre.  Located near the midpoint of a mag 14 star 2.3' N and a mag 11 star 2.7' S.  This galaxy is not identified as NGC 4549 in the RNGC or CGCG.  Located 4.3' ENE of the double system NGC 4547.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4549 = H III-807 = h1347 on 24 Apr 1789 (sweep 926) and recorded "Two [with III-802 = NGC 4547], both eF, S, E different ways.  The place is that of the first [NGC 4547], the 2nd [NGC 4549] is about 4' following and 3' more north, and still fainter than the 1st."  His offset pretty clearly identifies NGC 4549 = MCG +10-18-072 = PGC 41954, and this galaxy is certainly one of the faintest he discovered!


RNGC and CGCG misidentify MCG +10-18-070 (fainter member of a double system wth NGC 4547) as NGC 4549.  The identifications of NGC 4547 and 4549 are covered in Harold Corwin's identification notes and by Malcolm Thomson in his correction lists.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4554 in 1882 while observing NGC 4567/4568 (the "Siamese Twins").  He noted in the text portion of paper V "The double nebula is preceded by a very faint nebula, about -50 sec in RA and -2 1/2' in dec, according to my drawing." There is nothing at Tempel's offset and neither Bigourdan (visually) nor Royal Frost (photographically at the Harvard College Observatory) could locate Tempel's object.  Both Dorothy Carlson, in her 1940 list of NGC Corrections and RNGC classify the number nonexistent and Harold Corwin was unsuccessful searching for a good candidate.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4555 = H II-343 = h1350 on 6 Apr 1785 (sweep 393) and noted "a nebula, not large."  Caroline's reduction is 7 seconds of time preceding and 1.5' S of UGC 7762. On 13 Apr 1831 (sweep 343), John Herschel logged, "B; irreg R; vsmbM to a * 12m.".


Max Wolf mistakenly catalogued NGC 4555 in his 4th discovery list (W. IV-211) and labeled a much fainter nearby galaxy as NGC 4555.  As a result IC 3545 is another identity for NGC 4555. See Corwin's notes.

48" (4/7/13): very bright, very large, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, 9'x3', large bright core that gradually increased to the center.  The core appeared irregular, mottled and dusty.  The inner portion of the disc showed weak spiral structure.  At 488x, the outer halo was very patchy with several knots.  Superimposed on the southeast side are three mag 12/12.5/13 stars between 1.5'-2' from center and the galaxy faded out rapidly beyond these stars to the southeast.  Near the southeast end is IC 3563, a very compact HII region and IC 3564, a star association attached on the east side.  Both objects were easily visible but merged as a fairly faint 20" patch, 3' SE of center.


The outer halo faded out gradually and extended much further on the northwest side, up to 5' NW of center.  IC 3555 is faint, 20"x10" HII region, extended NW-SE, and situated 1.8' NNW of center in the halo.  IC 3552, a smaller HII region close NW, was not seen.  IC 3551 seen as a faint, 10" HII knot on the west edge, 0.9' WNW of center.  IC 3554 is a mag 15 star 2.1' SSW of center (at the edge of the visible disc) and IC 3550 = NGC 4559C was seen as a faint, 8" HII knot 0.8' WNW of the star.

The overall surface brightness is noticeably irregular with hints of brighter and darker spots.  The outer halo has a low surface brightness, particularly on the SE end which is wider than the NW side and shows no tapering.  A trio of mag 12-12.5 stars cradle the galaxy at this end and there appears to be mottling near the superimposed stars.  NGC 4559 is located exactly 2.0° N of NGC 4565.

Both Lord Adare and Mr Hamilton, who viewed it with me, agreed that a feeble parallel band extends below (north) of the nucleus."


R.J. Mitchell, Lord Rosse's assistant on 17 Apr 1855 , remarked "a beautiful object, very well seen in finding eyepiece.  The whole neb is much broader (taking into account the appendage) at Nucl than elsewhere, narrowing off suddenly and very symmetrically towards both ends, and the Nucl projects forward into the dark space; and immediately opposide this the faint appendage is broadest and brightest.  The ray is 12' or 14' long and there is a faint star at Alpha [on diagram]. (Mr. J. Stoney was with me)"

Because of his father's poor position, John Herschel recorded the pair as a Nova (h1358 and 1359) at the correct position.  He also made an observation with a poor position (h1363) that he associated with IV-8 and IV-9.  The error was noted by d'Arrest in a 1863 paper.


The nickname "Siamese Twins" was coined by Leland S. Copeland and mentioned in his Feb. 1955 article "Adventuring in the Virgo Cloud".

48" (2/18/12): Malin 1, a giant low surface brightness galaxy, lies 6.8' NNE of the center of NGC 4571.  At 287x, it was immediately picked up as an extremely faint, non-stellar glow.  At 488x, it was visible ~75% of the time with averted vision as a very small, round, low surface brightness, ~10" diameter.  With direct vision, a faint stellar nucleus was occasionally visible.


Malin 1, discovered in 1986 on an image by David Malin, has the most extended low surface brightness outer halo of any known disk galaxy with a diameter of 650,000 light years.  More recently it was discovered that within 30,000 light-years of Malin 1's center lies a normal barred spiral galaxy.  The galaxy lies at a distance of 1.1 billion light years.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4571 = H III-602 = h1362 on 14 Jan 1787 (sweep 691) and recorded "vF, cL, vgbM.  South of a cB star."  His position matches UGC 7788. John Herschel called this galaxy "vF; pL; E; vgbM; attached like a nail to a star (place that of the star.)  He included a sketch in the Slough Catalogue. JH's observation of h1367 may also apply to this galaxy.


Arnold Schwassmann found this galaxy again on 12 Sep 1900 using a plate taken by Wolf with the 6" astrograph at the Königstuhl Observatory in Heidelberg.  But he misidentified the nearby 14th mag star to the west (Sn. 292) as NGC 4571 and listed Sn. 293 (later IC 3588) as new.  His position for IC 3588 is an exact match with NGC 4571, although both Schwassmann and Dreyer missed the NGC designation, which has a good position.


Dreyer mentioned this galaxy as a possible candidate for M91, though this is very unlikely due to its faintness.  See Corwin's identification notes.

See observing notes for NGC 4591.  Identification uncertain.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4577 = H III-13 on 28 Jan 1784 (sweep 132) and recorded "a minute before [the transit of 24 Vir] I suspected a vS neb, but while I put on a higher power to examine it, I lost it and would not stop too long to look for it again."  A very rough position was noted.


Harold Corwin notes the star 24 Vir is actually a duplicate entry for 5 Boo, so WH made an error as his sweep is not near this star. "There are no galaxies in any of the places that come from WH's observations, from GC/NGC, or from attempting to correct WH's RAs using the idea that H II 26 = NGC 4453 (the only other nebula found that night) is actually NGC 4430. However, the approximate RA that we do have, along with the constraints on the declination, point to either NGC 4580 or NGC 4591 as probably being the object that WH saw. Since N4580 is H I 124, and N4591 is III 504, the sparce description of N4577 strongly suggests that it is N4591."

13.1" (3/24/84): about 20 stars resolved around edges of core and in halo.  The core is mottled but unresolved.


8" (3/24/84): few stars resolved across disk.


Charles Messier discovered M68 = NGC 4590 = h3404 on 9 Apr 1780.  WH described "a beautiful cluster of stars, extremely rich, and so compressed that most of the stars are blended together; it is near 3' broad and about 4' long, but chiefly round, and there are very few scattered stars about."  In his 1814 publication he noted "this oval cluster is also approaching to the globular form, and the central compression is carried to a high degree."  JH made the single observation "GC; irr R; gbM; diam in RA = 12...15 sec. All clearly resolved into stars 12 m; very loose and ragged at the borders."

82" (5/4/19, McDonald Observatory): at 400x; remarkable view of the Sombrero with a shockingly black dust lane (like an occulting bar) oriented precisely vertically through the entire eyepiece field.  Perhaps due to the curvature of the dust lane towards the tips and subtle structure in the galaxy's disc, the view had 3-dimensional depth, with the dust lane in front and the disc trailing into the background.


Sombrero UCD 1, an Ultra-Compact Dwarf discovered in 2009, was easily visible as a slightly soft mag 17.5 "star", 2.6' SSE of the center of M104.  It forms a 10" double with a somewhat brighter star.


48" (2/20/12, 4/5/13, 4/30/19): stunning view of the jet-black super high-contrast dust lane at 375x.  The fainter section of the galaxy south of the dust lane was quite prominent and nearly as extensive as the northern half and the central bulge region was noticeably thicker in proportion to the major axis than views in smaller scopes.  I also clearly noticed that although the dust lane was very flat in the central region (oriented precisely E-W), it bent slightly north and widened just a bit on both the east and west ends of the disc, giving it a slightly warped appearance.


17.5" (3/12/94): very bright, very large, elongated 3:1 E-W, 7.5'x2.5'.  Very prominent dust lane along the entire length of the major axis and divides the core into two non-symmetric sections.  The prominent section of the core is just north of the dark lane.  Overall, the galaxy is brighter and much more extensive to the north of the lane.  The portion of the core and halo south of the dust lane is much fainter, smaller and unconcentrated.  A mag 10 star lies 4' WSW.


13.1" (4/24/82): very bright, large, very elongated, arms long and thin.  A prominent dark lane is visible along the length of the galaxy.  Only a faint glow is visible to the south of the dust lane.


15x50mm (6/19/08 and 4/6/13): easily visible in binoculars as a elongated glow with brighter center.


Pierre Méchain discovered M104 = NGC 4594 = H I-43 = h1376 on 11 May 1781, after Messier's final catalogue was sent to publication.  The discovered was mentioned in a letter dated 6 May 1783 to Johann Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch.  He wrote, "On May 11, 1781, I have discovered a nebula above Corvus; it did not appear to me to contain stars; it is faint & very difficult to see when the wires of the micrometer are illuminated; I have compared it on this day & the following to the Ear of Virgo [Spica], & I have derived its right ascension 187d 9' 42", its south. declin. 10d 24' 49". It is not included in the Connoissance des tems."  The note was published near the end of the 1786 Jarbuch volume.  Messier penciled in the position into his own copy of his catalogue, published in 1784.  French astronomer Camille Flammarion introduced the new designation M104 in 1921.


As M104 wasn't published in Messier's catalogue, William Herschel was unaware of it and rediscovered it on 9 May 1784 (sweep 210).  He wrote, "E, vBM, about 5 or 6' long, but daylight is too strong to see the whole extent of it.  The bright place in the middle is prety large, but breaks off abruptly." He made a second observation on 11 Mar 1788 (sweep 819): "mE, from about 20° sp. to nf., BN, 4 or 5' long."


John Herschel was the first to note the dust lane.  On 9 Mar 1828, he recorded "vB, vmE, in pos 2° np to sf; vsmbM to a nucleus; 5' l, 30" br, a bright star sp.  There is a faint diffused oval light all about it, and I am almost positive that there is a dark interval or stratum separating the nucleus and the general mass of the nebula from the light above (south) of it.  Surely no illusion."  In his sketch (Fig. 50) he adds the remarks "The strong suspicion of a parallel appendage to the latter of these, is almost converted into certainty by its undoubted existence in V. 24 [NGC 4565], in which it was seen by two other observers as well as by myself."  Later sketches were made by William Lassell in 1862 with his 48" and Wilhelm Tempel in 1882 with an 11" refractor.  The first photo was taken by Isaac Roberts in April 1897.


Leland Copeland called M104 the "Sombrero" in the June 1942 issue of S&T.  The back cover featured an image taken by the Mount Wilson 60-inch in 1916. The image is referred to as the "Sombrero nebula".  The classic photo of M104 was made with the Palomar 200-inch in 1950 and published in the Hubble Atlas of Galaxies.

Christian Peters discovered NGC 4604 around 1881 with the 13.5-inch refractor at Hamilton College Observatory.  The discovery was not published in either of his two Copernicus lists in 1881 and 1882, so the discovery must have been communicated directly to Dreyer, though there is no description in the NGC.  The NGC position is 2' southeast of the center of NGC 4602.


The 1921 Helwan Observatory publication reported that NGC 4604 was not found on an 80 min exposure taken between 1914-16 with the 30" reflector.  Dorothy Carlson mentioned this in her NGC errata list and RNGC classified the number as nonexistent.  RC3 and SEGC identify MCG -01-32-037 = PGC 42489 as NGC 4604.  This galaxy is nearly 10' south of the NGC position.  This identification is possible assuming Peters made a single digit error in declination but considering the close match in position it is more likely that NGC 4604 is a duplicate observation of NGC 4602.  Harold Corwin leaves the identification NGC 4604 = PGC 42489 stand, but Courtney Seligman strongly argues that NGC 4604 = NGC 4602.

The southeast extension is clearly brighter and more tapered than the northwest end.  The surface brightness of the southeast extension is noticeably uneven with a mottled or splotchy appearance possibly from HII regions and an irregular distribution of dust.  Near the center there is a slight bend or kink to the major axis, with the fainter northwest extension slightly misaligned.

V = 6.9;  Size 5'


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 166x, 30 stars mag 9.5-13 are resolved in a 4'-5' region.  Most of the stars are arranged in a curving lane ~NNW-SSE with fainter stars trailing off to the NNW and a few stars scattered to the east. The main string is oriented roughly N-S and bends towards the east on the north side.  The cluster includes some doubles and triples with a nice mag 10.5 star pair at 15" and a distinctive triple on the south end of the lane.  Situtated just 7' NW of mag 5.3 BZ Crucis = HD 110432.  This star is located within the Coal Sack, 1.8 degrees east of Acrux, and is the only easy naked-eye star with the Coal Sack!  The cluster resides behind the Coal Sack and is dimmed accordingly.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/27/19 - Tasmania): faint, small glow attached to a bright star (BZ Crucis).


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4609 = D 272 = h3407 on 12 May 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 homemade speculum reflector from Parramatta, New South Wales and recorded "a group of five stars of the 8th or 9th magnitude, with a great number of extremely small stars resembling faint nebulae.  3' or 4' diameter."  His position is about 9' too far west.  JH called it a "Cluster class VII. Stars 11..13th mag; about 6' long and 4' broad; has 10 stars 11th mag, and some 20 or 30 smaller. It occurs in the midst of the black space following Alpha Crucis, which is by no means void of stars."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4610 = H II-19 on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 105) and recorded "South of and at rectangles to the great Nebula [M61] and the small star near it, is a nebula incomparably more faint.  My field [15' dia] takes them both in together."  Dreyer notes in the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues that "there is no nebula in the place of GC 3147 [NGC 4610]" (Ann Harvard Coll Obs, xiii p 81 and Max Wolf, List II) and that M49 is most probably H I-7 (assumed by WH to be M61).  Dreyer further comments that M49 has a smaller nebula [H II-498 = NGC 4470] 9 sec of RA west, 10.5' south and the sketch perfectly agrees with M49, the star following it and NGC 4470 (found by WH on 28 Dec 1785).  So, NGC 4610 = NGC 4470.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 4611 = St XII-49 on 17 May 1881 and recorded "eeF; S; lE SE to NW; between 2 vF stars."  His position and description matches UGC 7849.


Lewis Swift found this galaxy on 20 Apr 1889 and reported it as new in his 8th list, #65 (later IC 805) as "vF; pL; R; 2 pB stars n and nf." His position is about 8 sec of RA west of UGC 7849, but close enough that I'm surprised Swift or Dreyer didn't notice the equivalence.  Dorothy Carlson and Roger Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 equate NGC 4611= IC 805 although UGC, MCG, CGCG, PGC and HyperLeda only use the NGC 4611 designation.

Located at the SW end of a string of five bright stars mag 9-10.5 including a mag 10.5 star just 1.0' E.  The NE end is this string is a double star 10.5/12 at 20".  NGC 4623 lies 25' NNE.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4612 = H II-148 = H II-20 = h1384 on 23 Jan 1784 (sweep 105) and simply noted II-20 as "vF".  The four nebulae found on this short, early sweep were not placed well, and there is nothing at his position (CH's reduction).  But 1 min 45 sec of RA west is NGC 4612 = UGC 7850.  On 13 Apr 1784 (sweep 191) he found this galaxy again and noted II-148 as "not F, R, bM and growing fainter by slow degrees."  His offset from 31 Vir points to NGC 4612 = UGC 7850.  On 1 May 1786 (sweep 560) he recorded "preceding the most south of a row of stars.  cB, pL, mbM."  On this sweep he it was called II-20, and the internal designation (320) is crossed out in CH's fair copy.  Nevertheless JH decided II-20 and II-148 were possibly different objects because of the discrepancy in positions and assigned two GC designations, though Dreyer combined both in the NGC.  He commented in his 1912 revision of WH's catalogues that a sketch of II-20 "agrees perfectly with the the description of II-148 on 28 Dec 1785 (sweep 498) "preceding a row of considerable stars and near the south of them, making a triangle."

48" (4/7/13 and 4/19/17): fascinating one-armed asymmetric spiral (Arp 23).  At 488x the core region is offset to the north side and appeared extremely bright, irregular, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 1.6'x1.0'.  A prominent, thick, knotty arm is attached on the northeast end and sweeps counterclockwise to the south and then west.  It includes a small, round knot (listed in NED as infrared source SSTSL2 J124136.60+410900.6), 0.8' due east of center.  IC 3669 is a brighter arc or section of the arm, about 1' southeast of the core.  IC 3668 appears as a bright, elongated HII region(s) at the south end of the arm (1.7' south of center), ~20"x10".  The arm continues to rotate towards the north on the west side of the galaxy, but this feature has a very low surface brightness and ends roughly west of the core.  Only a faint, diffuse glow with no structure was seen to north of the core.  The total size of the galaxy extended 3.5'x2.5'.  NGC 4618 forms a pair with NGC 4625 8.3' NNE.  Interestingly, both galaxies have single prominent arms, though the arm in NGC 4625 was more subtle visually.   Member of the CVn II Group, with brightest member M106.


18" (5/15/10): This is a very unusual, asymmetric Arp galaxy with a single massive arm (similar to NGC 4027).  At 220x it appeared bright, fairly large, obviously irregular, with a slightly elongated main body ~2'x1.5', extended 4:3 SW-NE.  Within the main portion of the galaxy a brighter, elongated bar was visible, roughly 1.5'x0.5'.  The central bar, though, is displaced to the NW side of entire glow as extending mostly to the south side is a faint, beefy arm that often appears detached and barely connected on the east end of the central region.  This broad arm winds counterclockwise from east to south roughly 100° with IC 3668, the brightest region or knot near the south end of the arm, ~1.8' from the center of the bar.  This single arm increases the overall size to ~3'x2'.  IC 3369 refers to the brighter SE portion of the spiral arm.


13.1" (4/12/86): moderately bright, fairly large, faint elongated halo with large brighter core which appears displaced towards the north.  This is an unusual one-armed spiral galaxy with a more extensive halo on the south side.  Forms a pair with NGC 4625 8.3' NNE.  IC 3668 is a knot in the southern arm.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4618 = H I-178 = H I-179 = h1385 on 9 Apr 1787 (sweep 725) and recorded "Two. The most north considerably or vB.  The most south pB.  Their nebulosities run into each other; the most north vmbM."  The southern object may be IC 3668, the HII complex on the south end of the galaxy.  JH also called this galaxy double.  On 12 Apr 1830 he logged, "Double; a B, L nebula, gbM, with a F one attached, 70° sf, so as to run together into one; moonlight."


Two bright knots in the southern portion were noted on several observations with LdR's 72".  R.J. Mitchell sketched the galaxy on 27 Mar 1856 (in LdR's 1861 monograph) and clearly revealed the entire southern spiral arm.


Max Wolf found this galaxy in 1903 on a Heidelberg plate and catalogued it was new in his list VI-1 (later IC 3667), although his position is identical to the NGC.  IC 3668 and IC 3669 refer to bright knots or parts of the southern arm (probably observed at Birr Castle).

See observing notes for NGC 4665.  Uncertain identification.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4624 = h1390 on 9 Apr 1828 and noted"B, E. RA ill observed." and placed at 12 42 15.7 +03 03 32 (2000).  There is nothing near his position, though his description states this is a bright nebula.  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey, notes "not found; NGC 4624 = NGC 4636?"  NGC 4636 is 24' southeast of JH's position , but certainly fits the description and was not seen on the same sweep that NGC 4624 was observed.  Harold Corwin notes "During the same sweep, he [JH] made a one-degree error in the polar distance for NGC 4636, an error that he himself suggested, and that Dreyer finally rectified for the NGC. Thus, NGC 4624 cannot be NGC 4636 as suggested by Reinmuth and adopted by RNGC."  NGC 4600 is 2.0 min of RA west of JH's position, though probably would not be described as "bright" (WH called it "faint").


Harold Corwin concludes "[NGC 4624] is most likely NGC 4665 [nearly 3 min of RA east of JH's position] which JH described as "B, pL" in two other sweeps.  This, and the appearance of the bright bar of the galaxy, matches his terse description for NGC 4624, "B, E."  In addition, his declination is correct for all three observations. There is a faint possibility that NGC 4624 is NGC 4600, but JH's two observations of that make it "F, S" in contrast to his note on NGC 4624.  In addition, the declination of NGC 4600 is off JH's measured dec for NGC 4624."

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4629 on 19 Feb 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  There is nothing at his position (measured only this night).


Reinmuth describes NGC 4629 as a pair of mag 14 stars at 0.7' distance.  These two stars are 4' due south of d'Arrst's position, and a plausible candidate, though I would think would be too easily resolved.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent and NGC 4629 is not plotted on the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0 Sky Atlas.

48" (4/16/15): Although I've viewed NGC 4631 a few times previously in the 48-inch, it was difficult to take notes as the amount of structure was overwhelming.  At 375x (13mm Ethos, 16' field), the galaxy stretched across nearly the entire field and consisted of numerous bright luminous patches and irregular dark patches. The overall shape is asymmetric; gradually tapering down to nearly a point on the west end, bulging in the center and broader along the eastern side, only narrowing significantly near the very tip.


A mag 13.5-14 star is just north of the western tip.  A relatively bright knot (NGC 4631:[HK83]#91-94, from Hodge and Kennicutt's 1983 "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 galaxies") lies 0.6' SE of this star and 5.8' W of center.  Several obvious bright knots and splotchy regions line the western side of galaxy: #83 is 4.6' W of center, #79 is 3.9' W of center, #72/74 (a fainter spot) is 3.2' W of center, #63/64 (a prominent region) is 2.2' W of center.


A mag 12.5 star is at the north edge near the geometric center.  There is no obvious core to the galaxy, though several bright patches are near the center.  #47 is a luminous patch 1' S of the mag 12.5 star and #39/41 is a very bright patch 1.5' ESE of the star.  Additional HII patches are lined up on the east side, mostly along the northern edge of the galaxy.  #33-36 is a large, very bright patch (star cloud?) 2.4' ENE of center and #19/20 is a smaller knot 3.2' E of center.  The galaxy bulges out (star association or arm?) on the south side near the eastern end (3.3' from center) and contains #17/18/21/22.  The dusty eastern tip of the galaxy has a very faint HII knot (#5-7).


17.5" (6/5/99): at 280x (14' field) this remarkable galaxy runs edge to edge across the field!  The surface brightness is unusually irregular with bright and dark mottling across the surface.  There is no well-defined core but a prominent knot is close following (east) the geometric center along the north side and a second weaker knot is along the west side.  The north edge has an unusually "scalloped" appearance particularly along the west side due to dust and brighter splotches.  The galaxy gradually bulges towards the center and tapers at the tips, particularly along the west end.  A mag 13 star is situated just north of the edge at the geometric center and NGC 4627 appears to hover over this "starship" a couple of arc miinutes northwest of center.


13.1" (5/26/84): stunning galaxy, very bright, unusually large and interesting edge-on E-W, 15'x1.5'.  A bright knot is east of the core and a faint knot is west of core.  Appears very mottled along the major axis.  A mag 13 star is just north of the core.  NGC 4627, a companion galaxy, lies 2.6' NW of the center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4631 = H V-42 = h1397 on 20 Mar 1787 (sweep 722) and recorded "vB, mE from sp to nf, but near the parallel.  About 16' long and mbM.  A little below the center of it is a small star, but probably unconnected."  John Herschel made two observations and called it (sweep 74) "vmE; a long ray which crosses the whole field, rather curved upwards (to south).  Has a vF nucleus and a B * nearly in the parallel."  His sketch of the pair is on plate XV, figure 76 of the Slough Observations.


Three observations were made at Birr Castle.  On 26 Mar 1848, William Rambaut (Lord Rosse's assistant), wrote, "A most extraordinary object with a B * near the centre, and at the right [north] masses of light appear through it in knots."  George Johnstone Stoney made a detailed sketch on 19 Apr 1849 (published in the 1850 PT paper).  William Lassell sketched the galaxy on 27 May 1862 from Malta (plate V, figure 24) and included a knot on the west side, the bright region east of center, and a third knot towards the east end.  To determine a position, Kobold measured two of the knots/star clouds - one on the west side (#63/64) and the bright region east of the geometric center (#33-36).

Edward Swift, Lewis' 16 year-old son, discovered NGC 4633 = Sw. VI-46 on 27 Apr 1887 and recorded "eeF; pS; R; F star close preceding.; [NGC 4634] nr preceding."  The Swifts' position is 0.2 min of RA west of UGC 7874.  The description should read "F star close following".  Both Herschels missed this galaxy, although both observed nearby NGC 4634.


Arnold Schwassmann found this galaxy again on a plate taken with the 6" astrograph at Heidelberg at the turn of the century and assumed Sn. 295 (later IC 3688) was new, possibly due to the discrepancy in RA, or not checking the NGC carefully. All modern sources equate NGC 4633 = IC 3688.

24" (5/25/14): at 225x, this companion to NGC 4638 appeared extremely faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 E-W, ~25"x10".  Required averted vision and could not hold for fairly brief intervals.  Located 1.6' E of the center of NGC 4638.  The identification of this number is uncertain and it may be a duplicate of NGC 4647


R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 4637 on 1 Mar 1854 using LdR's 72" and recorded a "Double nebula [including II-70 = NGC 4638], faint nebulosity connects them."  No comment was made on the relative brightnesses or orientation and there were no further observations at Birr Castle or by any others.  RNGC identifies NGC 4637 with an extremely faint spindle-shaped galaxy just following NGC 4638. Although this is identification is reasonable (repeated by Carlson), the RNGC magnitude of 12.0 is greatly in error and the identifications of NGC 4637/4638 are reversed in MCG.


But Dreyer comments in the NGC notes "It is very possible that the Birr observer mistook M60 and III 44 [NGC 4647] for h1402 and a nova." In his photographic survey "Die Herschel Nebel", Karl Reinmuth notes "not found, = NGC 4647?"  Adelaide Ames also states "not found" in the Virgo-Coma Survey at Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for further analysis but the identification of NGC 4637 is uncertain - either applying to the faint companion of NGC 4638 or the companion of M60.

Pietro Baracchi observed the galaxy on 8 and 9 Apr 1885 and logged a new nebula that preceded by 38 seconds and 40" to the south, but at this offset is a faint double star.

24" (5/30/16): at 225x; moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE,  0.6'x0.3', bright irregular core seems knotty.  A mag 14.8 star is very close to the northeast edge.  Four collinear mag 13-14.5 stars extending to the northwest begins 2.5' W.


UGC 7905, a disturbed, interacting system with tidal tails extending from both galaxies, lies 8.5' ENE.  The pair is oriented SSW to NNE with centers separated by 35".  At 225x, the southwest member (Mrk 220) appeared fairly faint, small, high surface brightness, roundish, 18" diameter.  The northeast component (Mrk 221) appeared faint, fairly small, 18", low surface brightness. Only the central region was seen and I missed the tidal tail extending to the north and east.


18" (6/28/03): fairly faint, small, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 0.5'x0.25', stellar nucleus.  There appears to be a faint star at the NE tip (verified on DSS).  A striking line of four mag 13-14 stars (total length 2.8') is close NW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4646 = H II-910 = H II-794.2 = h1407 on 2 Apr 1791 (sweep 1001) and noted "F, S".  His position (CH's reduction) is within 1' of UGC 7891.  WH incorrectly assumed this object was II-794 = NGC 4644, located 16' north, and didn't assign a new internal number or include it separately in his catalogues.  JH recorded "Has 4 vS stars south-preceding in a line."  His position matches UGC 7891, though the string of stars is north-preceding.


JH sorted out the confusion with WH's two observations of II-794 in preparing the GC and listed them as II-794.1 and II-794.2.  Dreyer concurs these are different objects in "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" and introduced the new number II-910 for the second observation.


Dreyer examined the field at Birr Castle on 25 Apr 1878.  After observing NGC 4644, he moved 20' south and described NGC 4646 as "pB, E 50°, biN (Dist. 23"), 4 st nearly in a line p and a little n, 3'-4' from neb." The second "nucleus" is a very faint star at the northeast edge of the galaxy.  Then he reported "A third nebula, biN in Pos. 16.5°, Dist 44", sp Nucl much the brighter, other one fainter and smaller, perhaps composed of st.  This nebula is in Pos 71.5°, Dist 533" from [GC] 3179 [NGC 4646]." At this separation from NGC 4646 is the double galaxy UGC 7905, which fits Dreyer's description. He assumed this nebula was [GC] 5668 = NGC 4669, so UGC 7905 did not receive a NGC designation.

It appeared as a very faint, possibly "soft" star, just visible continuously with averted vision, and situated 1.4' SW of the center of M60.  The UCD forms a wide pair with a slightly brighter mag 16.5 star 0.5' NW.

Johann Koehler discovered M60 and M59 on 11 Apr 1779 and noted "Two very small nebulae, hardly visible in a 3-foot telescope: The one above the other."  Koehler was tracking the comet of that year.  Oriani independently discovered M60 on 12 Apr 1779, noting "Very pale and looking exactly like the comet."  Also, Messier made an independent discovery on 15 Apr 1779 (along with M58 and M59).


William Herschel first recorded M60 on 15 Mar 1784 (sweep 174) as "Two nebula [with NGC 4647], one of them vB." John Herschel's first observation was on 11 Apr 1825 (sweep 3).

48" (4/23/17): this showpiece galaxy was viewed at 375x and 488x and the structure/details was very comparable to the POSS2.  The galaxy extended ~8'x1' SW-NE, though it has a much lower surface brightness on the SW end.  It is well concentrated with a very bright and large, elongated core on the south end of the brighter half, giving a very asymmetric appearance.  A bright stellar or quasi-stellar knot is at the southwest edge of the core (this is a huge star cloud on the HST image identified in SIMBAD as [BKD2008] WR 462, from a 2008 paper on Wolf-Rayet features).  A faint (17th mag?) stellar object is close east.


The low surface brightness southwest portion of the galaxy to is broader than the northeast section.  It includes a faint, quasi-stellar knot (identified in SIMBAD as CasHII N4656a, from a 1984 Case University survey of HII regions in blue galaxies) along the western edge with a SDSS magnitude of 17.8V.


At least 4 main HII complexes are at the northeast end of the galaxy (NGC 4657), including a separate detached section.  On the southwest edge is a bright knot, ~8" diameter, catalogued in SIMBAD as CasHII N4656f and in NED as NGC 4656:[DBT2008] 85 from a 2008 paper on massive clusters.  A brighter 10" knot, identified in NED as 2MASX J12440599+3212340, is ~20" N, also along the west edge of the NE extension.  The northeast end of the galaxy (NGC 4657) has a sharp extension to the east with a slightly brighter patch, identified in NED as 2MASX J12440844+3212340. Finally a bright, elongated patch ~30"x15" oriented NNW-SSE is detached to the east.  SIMBAD identifies this object as NGC 4657, though the NGC designation should probably apply to the entire bent NE end of the galaxy.


18" (5/14/07): this fascinating galaxy forms one of the most striking pairs in the sky with NGC 4631 32' NW.  At 220x, the distorted shape extends ~9'x1.5' in a SW-NE orientation.  On first glance, it appears the bulging core is offset at the SW end, though with averted vision a very low surface brightness broader extension continues to the the SW of the core for several arcminutes before fading into the background.  The core is very bright and mottled with a bright knot (HII region) jutting out to the west at the southwest end of the core.  The NE extension has a remarkable, fairly bright 2' extension (NGC 4657), hooking to the east at a 45° angle from the major axis (the "blade" of the hockey stick).  There is a small, faint, detached knot beyond the east end of the "blade" that appears to have broken off.  The unusual bend and knot at the NE end is a result of a prior tidal interaction with its more massive neighbor, NGC 4631.


13.1" (4/10/86): striking!, fairly bright, very elongated SW-NE.  Appears wider and brighter at the SW end.  The NE end hooks sharply east to merge with NGC 4657 which may be a part of NGC 4656 and not a separate galaxy. A star or knot is attached at the south end.  Appears like a celestial hockey stick!


William Herschel discovered NGC 4656 = H I-176 = h1414, along with NGC 4657, on 20 Mar 1787 (sweep 722) and recorded "Two, their nebulosity join; they are both elongated and together form the shape of the letter "S".  The most south [NGC 4656] cB, mbM.  The most north [NGC 4657], pB from sp to nf, but very near the meridian.  John Herschel made a total of 5 observations.

24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this Centaurus cluster member (AGC 3526) was moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 0.8'x0.4'.  Located just 1' S of a 45" pair of mag 12.5 stars and 11.7' SE of NGC 4661.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4661 = h3415 on 5 Jun 1834 and logged "F; R; pL; gbM.".  His position was not measured accurately - the RA is given to the nearest minute of time and the RA to the nearest min of arc and marked "+/-".  There is nothing at his rough position, though 16' north is ESO 322-072  = PGC 42983, often referred to as NGC 4650B in the literature.  The letter designation originated in the RC2.  Corwin notes that ESO 322-072 is the only reasonably candidate for NGC 4661, so the identification is fairly certain.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4663 in 1883 with the 11-inch refractor at Arcetri in Italy.  In the narrative portion of his fifth paper (AN 2439) he described a nebula that is 8' south-following NGC 4658, but he was unable to make a measurement using the circle micrometer. This galaxy is 7.2' south-southeast of NGC 4663, so the identification is certain, although the NGC RA is 12 seconds too large and the Dec off by 2' too small.


Bigourdan found this galaxy again on 13 May 1888, assumed it was new, and reported it in his Comptes Rendus discovery lists as #176.  As a result, Dreyer recatalogued NGC 4663 as IC 811.  See Corwin's notes on IC 811

William Herschel discovered NGC 4664 = H II-39 on 23 Feb 1784 (sweep 158) and recorded "pB. It contains two stars in the center and is preceded by a small star at the distance of 1/2 or 3/4 minute."  There is nothing at his position, but 10' south is NGC 4665.  In the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues, Dreyer comments "Neither H nor h nor d'Arrest saw more than one nebula here, it is therefore = I-142 [NGC 4665] with an error of 10' in PD."  The star mentioned in the observation clinches the identification.  So, NGC 4664 = NGC 4665.  Although NGC 4664 is an earlier observation (I-142 was found on 30 Apr 1786), the modern designation is NGC 4665.  NGC 4624 may be another observation of this galaxy (see that entry).

There are no bright galaxies near his position, but Harold Corwin found that Herschel made an error in his reduction for h1421.

UGC 7905 = VV 708, located 8' WNW of NGC 4669, is a disturbed, interacting system with tidal tails extending from both galaxies.   The pair is oriented SSW to NNE with centers separated by 35".  At 225x, the southwest member (Mrk 220) appeared fairly faint, small, high surface brightness, roundish, 18" diameter.  The northeast component (Mrk 221) appeared faint, fairly small, 18", low surface brightness. Only the central region was seen and I missed the tidal tail extending to the north and east.  This pair was discovered by Dreyer, but didn't receive an NGC designation due to a misidentification.

He reobserved this galaxy on 24 Mar 1791 (sweep 1001).  JH mistakenly equated H III-778 with GC 3206 (NGC 4675).  Dreyer observed NGC 4669 on 25 Apr 1878 at Birr Castle (noting "F, S, E n-s"), but referred to it as GC 3206 and he repeated this error in the NGC.  In the same observation, Dreyer clearly observed UGC 7905 (pair described as "biN in pos 16.5°, dist 44"), but UGC 7905 didn't receive a NGC designation as he assumed it was NGC 4669!


Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered NGC 4669 on 10 Dec 1866 and noted a mag 10-11 star followed by 21.5 seconds of time, confirming the identification with UGC 7925.  Although Dreyer attributed d'Arrest with the discovery in the NGC, he equated H III-778 with NGC 4669 in his 1912 NGC Correction list.

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; the tidal tail north of IC 819 (NNW member of the interacting "Mice" (NGC 4676)) was very prominent as a direct vision streak, extending at least as far as the mag 17.3 star situated 1.6' due north of the center of the galaxy. The tidal tail to the south of IC 820 was only seen as a very low surface brightness glow without any definite structure.


48" (4/6/13): fascinating interacting pair consisting of IC 819 (NNW component) and IC 820 (slightly brighter SSE component), separated by 40" between centers.  At 375x and 488x in soft seeing, IC 819 appeared fairly bright, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 24"x16", high surface brightness. IC 820 was bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 30"x20", high surface brightness, increased to a small, very bright nucleus.  The two galaxies are connected or surrounded by a low surface brightness bridge.  IC 819 has a remarkable bright, long thin tidal tail shooting due north!  The tail has a high surface brightness (brightest feature of this type I've observed in any galaxy) and extends roughly 80"x8", dimming at the north end and ending just east of a mag 17.3 star.  IC 820 has a small, low surface brightness halo on its south side, but its tail to the south was not clearly resolved.


24" (5/22/17): the interacting "Mice" duo (Arp 242 = VV 224) was observed at 375.  IC 819 = NGC 4676A is the slightly fainter northwest component.  At 375x it appeared faint to fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 15" diameter.  The tidal tail was easily seen as a straight thin extension due north, so the combined galaxy/tail extended ~60"x10".  The tail has only a slightly lower surface brightness than the "head" (core of the galaxy).  IC 820 = NGC 4676 is the slightly brighter southeast member.  It appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, very small brighter nucleus, 20" diameter.  With averted vision the there was a strong hint of haze on the south side, but its tidal tail wasn't seen.  The cores of the pair are separated by just 38" between centers.


17.5": the northwest member (IC 819) of the interacting pair "The Mice" appeared faint, small, low surface brightness, elongated N-S.  NGC 4676B = IC 820, the southeast member of the pair was slightly brighter and appeared faint, small, round with a small bright core.  The thin "tails" of the the Mice extending north and south were not seen.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4676 = H II-326 = h1425 on 13 Mar 1785 (sweep 387) and noted "F, mE in the meridian [N-S]."  JH made the single observation "eF; query if not bicentral; sky perfectly clear".  So he was uncertain if there were two components and no observations were made at Birr Castle.  Rudolf Spitaler resolved the two component, IC 819 and IC 820, on 20 Mar 1892 with the 27" refractor at the Vienna observatory.


In a 1957 paper, Vorontsov-Velyaminov named this class of objects "mice" and the nickname was used in the Burbidge's 1959 paper "Some Interconnected Multiple Extragalactic Nebulae".

Stephane Javelle found IC 824 on 15 May 1893 and placed it accurately.


Because of the bad position, RNGC classifies NGC 4678 as nonexistent and MCG labels this galaxy IC 824, though NGC 4678 should be the primary designation.  This is either a merged double system with two nuclei or a bright knot is at the west end.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 4696 = D 511? = h3424 on 7 May 1826 and described a "pretty large faint nebula."  His position is 12' too far southeast.  It's also possible that D 510 refers to NGC 4696.  Dunlop's description reads "faint nebula, about 12" or 15" diameter, a little brighter to the centre, very faint at the margin."  His published position for D 510 15' too far northwest.  Neither of these positional discrepancies are unusually large, so either could apply.  The relative positions suggests D 510 = NGC 4696 and D 511 = NGC 4706, though that may be a coincidence.

The RA was only roughly taken in this early sweep and a two degree range for the polar distance.  He observed this galaxy again on 15 Apr 1784 and logged "vB, not L, lE, mbM.  It is between some pB stars."  Again on 1 May 1786 (sweep 560) he noted "cB; cL; between 2 pB stars, gmbM." and CH noted "See I.8."


In Dreyer's 1912 revision of William Herschel's catalogues, he notes "the place [of III-6] agrees sufficiently with that of I-8 (found on 23 Jan 1784), and a sketch also agrees with one of I-8.  The identity seems certain, and was assumed to be so by J.H. [in the GC]".  The NGC position is 10 tsec following UGC 9790.

James Dunlop probably discovered NGC 4709 = h3428 = D 511? on 7 May 1826 and reported "pretty large faint nebula".  His position (single observation) is 6.7' SW of NGC 4709.


John Herschel rediscovered NGC 4709 = h3428 on 7 May 1826 and recorded "pB; R; gbM; 30"." (More nebulae hereabouts.)"  His position was 1' too far northeast.  Joseph Turner probably discovered nearby ESO 322-102 on 4 May 1880 while observing NGC 4709 with the 48" Melbourne telescope.  MCG -07-26-057, a small companion 1' SE, was discovered at the Helwan observatory in 1921, based on a plate taken with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector in 1919-20.

The galaxy is irregular in surface brightness and mottled with a brighter knot near the NNE end.  A dust lane appears to slash across the galaxy to the NE of the core.  A mag 13 star lies 1.5' E of the core.


17.5" (5/14/94): beautiful edge-on 5:1 SSW-NNE (PA 30°), bright bulging core.  Distinctly mottled with an irregular surface brightness and clearly brighter along the NNE extension.  A mag 13 star is 1.4' E of center.  At 280x, the dimensions are 3.5'x0.6' and the galaxy appears to have a sharper light cut-off along the preceding edge possibly due to dust.  Very mottled with a couple of bright and dark patches along the major axis. IC 3806 lies 19' SW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4710 = H II-95 = h1441 on 21 Mar 1784 (sweep 182) and noted "pB, vmE.  The direction of extent is nearly in the meridian or perhaps about 5 or more degree sp and nf."  His position was poor, but JH observed the galaxy twice, noting "vB; vmE; pos = 28.5° by micrometer; bM; 90" long" and measured an accurate position.


A total of 12 observations were made at Birr Castle.  On 16 Feb 1855, R.J. Mitchell wrote "vB ray, a dark band across on each side of nucleus, separating it from the extremities."  The dark lane was commented on in each observation.  On 16 Apr 1855, he wrote "My sketch exaggerates the dark lines, they should be broader and not so well defined.  Mr. Johnstone Stoney [visiting between professorial duties] remarked a second dark line across the n branch near its extremity."  On 13 Apr 1876, Dreyer logged "cB, pL, bM, no very defined Nucl, E 28.2°, about 230" long.  On both side of Nucl are dark bands.  The n end of neb is brighter than s one and the maximum of brightness is about 40" from the end.  Maximum in s part is nearer the nucleus.  Centre looks a little oval with higher power."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4711 = H II-412 = h1443 on 1 May 1785 (sweep 405) and recorded "F, S, E, er."  His position is only 4 sec of RA east of UGC 7973. JH's single position is 38 sec of RA too large and he used this erroneous position in the GC as well as by Dreyer in the NGC.  Perhaps because of this error, the UGC and CGCG do not label the entries as NGC 4711.


Max Wolf found the galaxy on a Heidelberg plate on 21 Mar 1903, assumed it was new, and Dreyer recatalogued it as IC 3804.  So, NGC 4711 = IC 3804.  CGCG, UGC, and MCG use the IC desgination, though the primary identity should by NGC 4711.  This confusion was noted by Malcolm Thomson as well as Harold Corwin.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4722, along with NGC 4723, in 1882, and reported it in the narrative portion of his fifth discovery paper (AN 2439).

Bigourdan independently discovered this galaxy on 15 Apr 1895 and reported it as Big. 302 (later IC 3833) with an accurate position, so the IC identification is certain.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4723, along with NGC 4722, in 1882, and reported it in the narrative portion of paper V (AN 2439). He simply noted "Following [NGC 4714] are two class III nebulae that I sketched, but could not yet measure."  One of these is likely IC 3833 = PGC 43560, which is 1.2 min of RA following NGC 4714, and NGC 4722 is equated with this galaxy.  Herbert Howe could only find this object when he searched the field, so the identification of the second galaxy is very uncertain.


One possibility is the second galaxy is MCG -02-33-026 (RNGC and PGC equate NGC 4723 with this galaxy), located 9' northwest of IC 3833, though it may be too faint to have been picked up by Tempel.  MCG does not label their catalogue entry as NGC 4723.  Another possibility is the second galaxy is a reobservation of NGC 4848, located 11' southeast of IC 3833.  Finally, a third possibility is MCG -02-033-024, located 11' southwest of IC 3833.  As


The identification here is the one used in the NGC and PGC, but as Harold Corwin comments "It's clear, though, that we do not (yet) know which nebulae Tempel found."

The following February, Bindon Stoney logged "Spiral, 2 arms and some stars in following arm."   On 15 Apr 1858, R.J. Mitchell wrote "vL and vB.  The centre itself it like an E neb with Nucl; the centre is enveloped is an irr ring or rings of nebulous light as in the accompaning rude sketch, which does not contain all the details."  His sketch clearly shows the inner ring was resolved.  On 3 May 1858, he added "The surrounding ring of nebulosity is of irregular shape, it curves gently at delta (south preceding end) but bends more sharply at gamma (north following end), where it is brightest. The centre seems to reach up to and to blend with the nebulosity at delta."

NGC 4726 = PGC 926789

12 50 46.1 -14 16 07; Crv

Size 1.0'x0.2';  PA = 76°


18" (5/16/09): extremely faint, very small, slightly elongated, 15"x12".  Based on this description I only viewed the core region of this thin edge-on.  Located 1.2' SSE of a mag 12 star and 4.5' NW of the NGC 4724/4727 duo.  The identification of this NGC number is uncertain and most other sources equate it with IC 3834.


IC 3834 appeared faint, small, round, low even surface brightness.  A mag 15 star lies 43" W of center.  Located 11' NE of the NGC 4727/4724 pair.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4726 in 1882.  In the narrative portion of his fifth paper (AN 2439) he mentions "4' further north of the beautiful double nebula [NGC 4724/4727] is a fainter companion."  Dreyer's position is 4' north of the midpoint of NGC 4724 and 4727.   LEDA 926789 is situated 4.5' north-northwest of the pair and the only galaxy in the vicinity.  But is it too faint to have been picked up by Tempel with the 11-inch refractor at Arcetri Observatory?  Possibly, so this identification is uncertain.


Herbert Howe searched unsuccessfully for this object at the NGC position in 1899 with the 20-inch refractor in Denver.  But on two nights he measured an object which he assumed was NGC 4726.   His position (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) matches IC 3834 = PGC 43559, a much brighter galaxy discovered by Bigourdan on 14 Apr 1895 and recorded as B. 303.  This galaxy is nearly 11' northeast of NGC 4724/4727, so it doesn't match Tempel's object.  But based on Dreyer's erroneous "corrected" position, modern catalogues (with the exception of NED) identify IC 3834 as NGC 4726.

John Herschel discovered NGC 4729 = h3430, along with NGC 4730 = h3431, on 8 Jun 1834.  He gave only a single approximate position (nearest minute of RA and nearest minute of dec, both marked as +/-), although he mentions in his observation of NGC 4744 on the same sweep that this pair was to its southwest.  ESO 323-016 and ESO 323-017 are 5' and 8' southeast of JH's rough position, and these are the two brightest galaxies southwest of NGC 4744.

48" (4/2/11): this is an amazing stretched barred spiral with a long, thin central bar oriented NW-SE and long extensions (spiral arms) at the northwest end gently curving west, along with one at the southeast end of the bar extending east.  The entire galaxy forms a very distinctive integral sign outline, stretching 5' E-W!  The bar is very bright and very elongated, ~4:1 NW-SE, 1.6'x0.4'.  The arm on the east side is slightly brighter and longer.  It seems to fan out and become patchy near the end.  A 15th magnitude star is at or just beyond the tip.  The western arm curves gradually to the south and faint haze extends from the arm to the south increasing the total size.  A mag 14 star is just south of the bar and a small triangle of fainter stars is north of the bar.  A faint, very small HII knot (NGC 4731:[HK83] 21/22) is squeezed between the triangle of stars and the bar.


NGC 4731A was picked up 10' SSE and appeared moderately bright and large, irregularly round, ~0.6' diameter, broad concentration, brightens gradually to the center.  A faint star or knot at the SW edge was not noticed in a quick observation at 375x.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 4740 = Sw. VI-49 on 27 Apr 1887 and recorded "pF; pS; R; mbM."  There is nothing at this position, but 50 sec of RA west is NGC 4727 and this relatively bright galaxy is a good match in description.  The closest galaxy to Swift's position, though, is IC 3834, which is located 6' north and 14 sec of RA preceding.  So, there are two possible candidates.


Herbert Howe, examining the area in 1899 with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver, commented "I cannot see anything in the NGC place for NGC 4740.  Under date of 1899 August 9 Dr. Swift writes, in reply to a query: "I have examined the record of 4740, and find that it was made 1887 April 27, with position 12 46, -13 41.  The right ascension is for 1890, the declination for date of discovery.  I have no recollection about it."  This position agrees so well with NGC 4726 that I assume them to be identical."  But Howe couldn't find NGC 4726 at Tempel's location 4'  north of NGC 4724/4727 but found IC 3834, which he assumed was NGC 4726.


Malcolm Thomson feels NGC 4740 is IC 3834, but Harold Corwin argues that NGC 4740 is more likely a duplicate observation of NGC 4727.

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 4752 may refer to CGCG 71-058.

V = 4.2;  Size 10'


13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, 120-150 stars are resolved in the Jewel Box cluster with careful viewing.  A huge number of mag 13-14 stars form a rich carpet in the background of a half-dozen very bright stars in the cluster.  Most prominent is a string of three 6-7th magnitude stars and orange-red DU Crucis (V = 7.2-7.7) 40" NE of the 'central' star, mag 7 HD 111934 (BU Cru).  The half-dozen brightest stars in the cluster form a capital "A" asterism.  The mag 5.9 star on the southeast end is often identified as Kappa Crucis (B2-type Supergiant).  The star distribution is very irregular with a number of stars arranged in strings, loops, pair and triplets.  This small naked-eye cluster is just north of the Coalsack and roughly one degree SE of mag 1.3 Mimosa (Beta Crucis).


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): the Jewel Box cluster is a beautiful, naked-eye cluster about a degree SE of Beta Crucis.  At 186x, the cluster includes a half-dozen very bright stars (mag 6-7.5) set over a rich background of scores of mag 9-13 stars within a compact 10' diameter.  A line of three mag 6-7 crosses the center of cluster from NW to SE with a striking orange-red variable star (DU Crucis = SAO 252073) near the center.  Other stars have blue-white and yellow-whites tints, though these are more subdued.  To the south of the cluster is the remarkable 6°x4° oval dark Coalsack which sits adjacent to the SE side of the Southern Cross.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/27/19 - Tasmania): the Jewel Box is bright naked-eye cluster close to Beta Crucis (Mimosa).  Several very bright stars were resolved and some fainter stars using the 10x30 binoculars.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 4755 = Lac II-12 = D 301 = h3435 in 1751 through a 1/2" telescope during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He classified it as a nebulous star cluster and noted "5 or 6 small stars between two of sixth magnitude".  It was probably next observed at the Parramatta Observatory during regular meridian work and described as "a cluster of 12 or 14 small stars, in the form of a rhomboid, very close together. Part of this cluster forms a very perfect cone of mixed stars."  Using his 9-inch speculum reflector in 1826, James Dunlop described "(Kappa Crucis, Bode) is five stars of the 7th magnitude, forming a triangular figure, and a star of the 9th magnitude between the second and the third, with a multitude of very small stars on the south side - Figure 13 is a very correct representation."


John Herschel first observed the cluster on 14 Mar 1834 and recorded "the central star (extremely red) of a most vivid and beautiful cluster of from 50 to 100 stars. Among the larger there are one or two evidently greenish; south of the red star is one 13th mag, also red; and near it is one 12th mag, bluish."  In preparation for his meticulous sketch of the cluster, he drew up a catalogue of 110 stars, accompanied by the following explanation: "Though set down by Lacaille as nebulous, and on that authority entered as a nebula in Bode's Catalogue, no nebula is perceptible in any part of the extent of this cluster, which though neither a large nor a rich one, is yet an extremely brilliant and beautiful object when viewed through an instrument of sufficient aperture to show distinctly the very different colour of its constituent stars, which give it the effect of a superb piece of fancy jewelery. The area occupied by it is about one-forty-eighth part of a square degree, within which area I have laid down, partly from micrometric measures (as regards the large stars) and partly from intertriangulation by the eye (as respects the small ones) the stars (110 in number) of the following catalogue." JH listed eight stars in which the "colour is conspicuous"; 3 are described as "greenish-white, 2 are green, 1 blue-green, 1 red and 1 ruddy.


In May 1862, English amateur astronomer and meteoroligist Francis Abbott constructed a map of 75 stars (from Hobart, Tasmania) five of which Abbott thought were not shown by Herschel.  He commented "certain changes are apparently taking place in the number, position, and colours of its component stars."  In 1872 Henry Chamberlain Russell, director of the Sydney Observatory, decided to investigate Abbott's claim and carefully measured the positions of the stars using the observatory's 7.25" refractor and creating a catalog of 130 stars.  He mistakenly noted change also, as he thought several stars had changed their positions based on Herschel's sketch and several faint stars that Russell measured were surprisingly missed by JH.   Russell later took perhaps the first photograph of the cluster in 1891.  In 1929 Trumpler classified the cluster as type I 3 r -; "Detached, strong concentration, bright and faint stars in the cluster, rich in stars, without nebulosity."

Contains a small bright core surrounded by a lower surface brightness halo.  Located 1.5' N of a mag 9.5 star that detracts somewhat.  Nearly tangent to the northwest edge is slightly fainter NGC 4776 = HCG 62B, which appeared fairly faint but very small, round, 20"-24" diameter. NGC 4761 = HCG 62c lies just 1.3' following.


17.5" (4/13/96): the brightest object in HCG 62 is a double system with southeast component HCG 62A = NGC 4759e = NGC 4778 and northwest component HCG 62B = NGC 4759w = NGC 4776.  The southeast galaxy is the brighter of the pair and appears fairly faint, round, 1.0' diameter, increases to a small bright core.  Virtually attached at the northwest edge is a slightly fainter and smaller galaxy, round, 20" diameter, faint stellar nucleus.  Mag 9 SAO 139019 is just 1.5' SSW of the pair.


17.5" (5/17/90): double system consisting of NW component NGC 4759a = NGC 4776 and SE component NGC 4759b = NGC 4778 with 28" separation between centers.  The NW member appears faint, very small, slightly elongated N-S, bright core.  The contact companion NGC 4759b is attached at the SE end.  The SE member is the slightly larger and brighter of the double system and appears faint, small, slightly elongated E-W, bright core.  Located 2' N of mag 9.1 SAO 139019.  Second of four with NGC 4761 1' ENE and NGC 4764 4' S.  The SE component is incorrectly listed in the RNGC as NGC 4761.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4759 = H II-559 on 25 Mar 1786 (sweep 546) and simply noted "F, S".  His position corresponds with this double system.  John Herschel resolved the pair and assigned them two designations - h3437 = NGC 4776 and h3438 = NGC 4778, although his RA was 1.0 tmin too large.  In the GC, JH equated H. II-559 with h3437 (assuming his father's position was poor).


Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen on 30 Mar 1867 and noted a mag 10 star 1.5' south and 1-2 tsec precding, but only saw a single (unresolved) nebula.  Wilhelm Tempel, later using an 11-inch refractor at Arcetri Observatory, confirmed d'Arrest's position but described it as double.  Dreyer gave H. II-559 = NGC 4759 a separate (accurate) designation in the NGC, noting it as double, assuming II-559 must be different from JH's pair.


RNGC and MCG misidentify the components of the double system as NGC 4759 and NGC 4761, while ESGC identifies the pair as NGC 4776 and 4778.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4764, along with NGC 4761, in March 1882, and reported it in his 5th paper near NGC 4776 and 4778.  The NGC description reads "eF, eS, sf Dneb 4759." As Tempel didn't mention any direction in the Astronomische Nachricten article, this information was perhaps communicated directly to Dreyer.


NGC 4764 is probably HCG 62D = PGC 43760, located 3.5' due south of the double system NGC 4759 = NGC 4776/NGC 4778.  If this identification is correct, HCG 62D would be the faintest galaxy Tempel discovered (V = 15.0).  RNGC and MCG identify HCG 62C = NGC 4761 as NGC 4764.  The identifications are discussed by both Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin.

But exactly 1° north is NGC 4802 (found later by Tempel) and Harold Corwin suggests NGC 4804 = NGC 4802.  Because of the poor position, NGC 4804 was not recovered by Bigourdan.

There is nothing at his position, and Harold Corwin states "NGC 4805 is a star positively identified by Bigourdan's two observations.  In spite of the accuracy of his measurements, he comments that "... near it is a star 13.4-13.5, but it's impossible to tell which direction it is from the nebula's center.''  This must be the object itself as there is nothing else in the area that he could have seen."

This galaxy has an unusual irregular "banana" shape with a patchy appearance; it bends slightly south on the east-northeast end and has a blunter west-southwest end that also twists slightly south. There is a slightly brighter patch that is offset just north of the geometric center.  I assumed this was the core region, but on the SDSS it appears to be a large HII region and there is no central core.  A second slightly brighter patch is at the west-southwest end and this is clearly an active star-forming complex on the SDSS.

R.J. Mitchell discovered NGC 4809, along with NGC 4810, on 18 Apr 1855 while looking for h1509 [NGC 4900] with LdR's 72".  He described a "faint, double nebula, elongated at right angles to each other." He gave a rough position of 12 48.5 (1860) and stated it was "a little north of [NGC 4900]."


Mitchell's description pins down the identification of the pair, but John Herschel and Dreyer could only list a single (rough) position in the GC and NGC. The identification of NGC 4809 with the northern component is from the RC2 and repeated in the NGC 2000.0 and RNGC.  But UGC reverses these identifications and has a typo with the RA (1 min too large).  The data (size, PA and possibly magnitudes) listed under NGC 4810 in the RC3 applies to NGC 4809.  The position angle listed under NGC 4809 probably applies to NGC 4810.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, two mag 10 stars are surrounded by a number of very faint stars within 3'.  The cluster is superimposed on a fairly bright milky background of unresolved stars.  A third mag 10 star is apparently outside the border off the SW edge. At 200x, the unresolved glow is most prominent at the following end and 12-15 mag 13 stars are sprinkled over the backround glow (the cluster was viewed at a very low elevation which probably detracted from the view).  This reddened cluster is heavily obscured and is located just within the SE border of the Coalsack and barely over the border into Musca, 1.1 degrees ENE of the bright double star Theta Muscae (5.9/7.7 at 5").  The two brighter mag 10 stars (separated by 1.3') may be foreground stars and not actual cluster members.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4815 = h3443 on 13 Mar 1834 and recorded "Class VI, p rich, irregular fig, gbM, 3', stars vS, comparatively insulated; has two bright stars 8-9th mag and 9-10th mag."  On a second observation he described a "Cluster, R, pS, resolved; irreg; gbM, 3', stars 13..18th mag."  Innes was unable to resolve the cluster in 1901 using a 7-inch refractor from the Cape of Good Hope (MN, 62, 469).

Wilhelm Tempel discovered the trio of NGC 4820, 4823 and 4829 in 1882, just south of NGC 4825.

13.1" (4/29/84): very bright, large, oval 2:1 WNW-ESE, 6'x3', small bright core, almost stellar nucleus.  The famous curved dark patch or "Black Eye", located just northeast of the core, was quite prominent and visible with direct vision.  Located 55' NE of the tight double star 35 Comae.


Johann Bode is generally considered the discoverer of M64 = NGC 4826 = h1486 on 4 Apr 1779, but Edward Pigott discovered the Black Eye galaxy a few days earlier on 23 Mar 1779.  Charles Messier independently rediscovered it on 1 Mar 1780.  Pigott's discovery was announced in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. LXXI (1781), p82-83, but was generally missed until 2002.   See http://www.seds.org/messier/more/m064_pigott.html for more of the story.


The nickname "Black-eye" is from William Herschel's description on 13 Feb 1787 (sweep 699): "A very remarkable object, mE about 12' long, 4 or 5' broad, contains one lucid spot like a star with a small black arch under it, so that it gives one the idea of what is called a black eye, arising from fighting."  His earlier observation on 13 Apr 1785 (sweep 398) reads "vB, E from np to sf, about 7 or 8' long and 2' broad.  A vB nucleus in the middle, but moonlight and haziness probably lessen its appearance considerably.  The nucleus is very small in proportion to the rest and is not round, but irreg elongated in the same direction."


John Herschel described his sketch as follows: "The dark semi-elliptic vacancy (indicated by an unshaded or bright portion in the figure) which partially surrounds the condensed and bright nucleus of this nebula, is of course unnoticed by Messier. It was however seen by my Father, and shown by him to the late Sir Charles Blagden, who likened it to the appearance of a black eye, an odd, but not inapt comparison. The nucleus is somewhat elongated, and I have a strong suspicion that it may be a close double star, or extremely condensed double nebula."  So perhaps Blagden first mentioned the term and William liked the analogy used it in his description.


At least 18 observations of the "black eye" were made at Birr Castle.  On 11 Mar 1848 (one of the earliest descriptions): "curious circular-shaped nebula, with a dark and large spot at one side, around which is a close cluster of well-defined little stars."  Using his 48-inch on Malta, William Lassell's sketch from 22 Apr 1862 showed the "remarkable dark space" as distinctly crescent-shaped and he noted it appeared "as dark as any part of the surrounding sky."

James Dunlop observed this globular with his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector on 29 Apr 1826 (second night he recorded objects) from Parramatta, New South Wales  and described "a pretty bright round nebula, about 4' diameter, moderately condensed to the centre. This, with the sweeping power, has the appearance of a globe of numerous matter with very small stars in the north following margin. But with a power sufficient to resolve it, the globular appearance vanishes in a very considerable degree; and the brightest and most condensed part is to the preceding side of the centre, with the stars considerably scattered on the N.f. side. Resolvable into stars of mixt small magnitudes. A small nebula precedes this." He observed the cluster on 5 nights.


John Herschel first recorded "globular cluster, B, L, R, gbM, stars 14th mag, and one 7th mag north-preceding the centre; a fine object." On a second sweep he logged "globular cluster, pB, L, p rich, at first gradually, then vspmbM; diameter of the bright part 3', of the loose stars 10'; stars 12..16th mag, and one large one 7th mag, 3' or 4' north of the centre."

John Herschel discovered NGC 4837 = h1489 on 7 Mar 1831 and recorded "a rather doubtful object; haze".  There is nothing near his position, but 30' south is UGC 8026, a reasonable candidate assuming a digit error in recording the North Polar Distance.

With respect to NGC 4839 his position is 11-12 sec of RA east and 0.4' north.  The actual offset is 11.5 sec east and 0.3' south (to the brighter northern component), so he apparently reversed the offset sign in declination.  As a result the NGC position is off from d'Arrest's usual accuracy. The two components are listed separately in the MCG.

He recorded "following on the parallel with [NGC 4838] is another faint, nebulous star."  No position or even offset was mentioned, so the NGC position must have been communicated directly to Dreyer, but only faint stars are near this position.

Truman Safford discovered NGC 4849 = Sf. 23 = Spitaler 61 on 16 May 1866 and noted "pB".  His RA is 8 seconds east of UGC 8086 = PGC 44424, but the declination matches.  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered the galaxy again on 4 Mar 1867 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  There is nothing at his position, but 3.5' north is UGC 8086.  Dreyer used d'Arrest's position in the NGC.


Rudolph Spitaler also found this galaxy in 1891 with the 27-inch refractor at Vienna and wasn't sure if it was new.  He noted, "Brightness and appearance like Nova 58.  Probably identical with the Nova d'Arrest. Northeast of this nebula, at 1.5', there is still another nebula, but much faint; Both together form a pretty double nebula."  Spitaler's position for NGC 4849 (given in the IC 1 notes) is still 1.5' too far south!


Finally, Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again on 12 Jun 1895 with the 30-inch refractor at Nice and reported it as new in list 3-1230.  Dreyer overlooked Spitaler's position and recatalogued it as IC 3935.  So, NGC 4849 = IC 3935.  CGCG mislabels this galaxy as IC 838 (a companion galaxy 1.9' north-northeast mentioned by Spitaler).

At 200x it was a pretty impressive collection of ~150 stars mag 10-16 in a 10' region including several mag 10-10.5 stars.  One subgroup makes a neat "zig-zag" or "M" outline while another set of stars forms a "V" shaped group.  There are no real rich subgroups but still it forms a nice cluster.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4852 = D 311 = h3449 on 30 Apr 1826 with his 9-inch reflector from Parramatta, New South Wales, and recorded "a very faint pretty large nebula about 6' or 8' diameter, round figure, resolvable into very minute stars. Several stars of some considerable magnitude appear scattered among the minute stars of the nebula, but they are only the continuation of a branch of small stars which run over the place where the nebula is; the stars in the nebula are very gradually, but not much, compressed to the centre." He observed the cluster of 4 times and his catalogued position is ~8' SE of the center of the cluster.


On 31 Mar 1834, JH recorded "a very poor cluster of about 70 stars 11..15th magnitude, very loosely scattered over a space about 15' long and 8' br." His second observation reads "Cluster VII. p rich, L, irr R, 10' diameter, 80 or 100 stars, 10, 11, 12 mag, with a stippling of much smaller ones."

48" (4/7/13): very unusual appearance at 488x as the galaxy is dominated by a very high surface brightness HII region (Mrk 59) at the SSW end, about 15" in diameter and 13th magnitude. The knot appeared extremely bright, roundish, sharp-edged.  The main glow of the galaxy is very elongated to the NNE, 3.0'x 0.6', extending just past a mag 13 star near the opposite end.  The core is a somewhat brighter, elongated, knotty region, offset closer to the giant HII region.  The glow of the galaxy dims as it extends to the star at the opposite end and fades out just beyond. Member of the NGC 5033 Group (LGG 334).


PGC 101479, a compact galaxy, is exactly in line with the major axis of NGC 4861, 3.5' NNE of the mag 12 star.  It appeared faint or fairly faint (B = 16.8), round, 12"-15" diameter.


17.5" (1/23/93): faint, very elongated SSW-NNE, even low surface brightness.  Located between two mag 12 stars at low power.  The "star" at the SSW end is slightly nebulous at 166x and appears as a definite nonstellar knot at 332x.  UGC and CGCG misidentify this HII region as NGC 4861 (and the galaxy as IC 3961).  This is one of the few extragalactic HII regions which responds to OIII filtration.


13.1" (2/23/85): faint, elongated streak SSW-NNE.  Stretches between two 12th magnitude "stars".  The star at the south end is actually a giant HII region and it appears slightly fuzzy at 166x and clearly nonstellar at 312x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4861 = H IV-30 = h1499 on 1 May 1785 (sweep 405) and logged, "two stars at about 3' distance connected with a vF narrow nebulosity."  His position matches Arp 266 and the "star" at the south end is the unusually bright HII knot.  JH made three observations and on sweep 131 reported "a vF neb; E nf to sp, between 2 stars, the southern of which is ill-defined.  Both seem to belong to the nebula."  So, he felt the HII knot was perhaps non-stellar.  R.J. Mitchell, using LdR's 72" on 17 Apr 1855, recorded "vF, mE sp nf, has a plain star in the north extremity and either a star or what looks more like a bright little knot involved in the south end."


Max Wolf found the galaxy in 1903 on a Heidelberg plate and his position for W. V-103 is on the center of the galaxy.  Despite an accurate position and description, Dreyer recatalogued NGC 4861 as IC 3961.


UGC and CGCG identify the main galaxy as IC 3961 and the bright HII knot as NGC 4861 (Webb Society Quarterly Journal #45, July 1981).  Although LdR noted a "bright little knot" at the south end, the HII complex was not given a separate designation in the NGC or IC.

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 4862 = LM 1-194, along with NGC 4863, on 26 Feb 1886.  His rough position (nearest min of RA) is a good match with MCG -02-33-079 = PGC 44610 and his sketch (examined by Harold Corwin) confirms this identification.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver at the turn of the century (listed in the IC 2 Notes section).  In MN Vol LXI #I, he also mentioned "Another was suspected perhaps 5 arcmin south of this one."  There is nothing at this position, but 5' north is NGC 4863, probably the suspected object.


IC 3999, found by Bigourdan in 1895, may be a duplicate observation.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes on IC 3999 for the story.

William Herschel probably discovered NGC 4864 = H II-388 = h1500 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and recorded "Two, the time taken between them."  His single position is 2.5' northwest of NGC 4874, which is certainly one of these two.  John Herschel assigned WH's second object (H. II-388) to NGC 4869 in the GC and Dreyer followed suit in the NGC.  Harold Corwin argues that NGC 4864 is a better match in position and probably visibility.  See his identification notes.


John Herschel independently discovered this galaxy on 13 Apr 1831, and noted "The first of 5 south of a * 7m.  Place by configuration with the others."  His position is noted as very rough, but his sketch (emailed by Wolfgang Steinicke) verifies h1500 = NGC 4864.  Heinrich d'Arrest first observed NGC 4864 on 10 May 1863 and measured the position on 3 nights.  He marked the equivalence with h1500 as uncertain.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4867 = Big 62 on 10 May 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  In d'Arrest's description of NGC 4864, he mentions it forms a close double, though no position was given.  Bigourdan independently found this galaxy on 28 Apr 1885 and noted it was very close to GC 3343 [NGC 4864] but easily distinguishable.  Bigourdan's Comptes Rendus position was 1.4' too far north and as a result the position is northeast of NGC 4864 in the NGC, instead of southeast. Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position in 1895, though it wasn't published until 1907. Harold Corwin proposes that William Herschel may be the original discoverer of NGC 4864/4867.

Dreyer equated William Herschel's H. II-389 and John Herschel's h1502 with NGC 4872, but these two designations apply to much brighter NGC 4874.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4874 = H II-389 = h1502 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and recorded "Two [along with NGC 4864], the time taken between them."  His position (CH's reduced position) is 2.5' northwest of NGC 4874, in line with his offset of 3.5' northwest for NGC 4889.  Dreyer misassigned II-389 = h1502 to nearby NGC 4872, but this is a much fainter companion that was discovered by Heinrich d'Arrest.  John Herschel simply noted "The third of 5; place by configuration", but he associated it with II-389 and his sketch confirms h1502 = NGC 4874.  Also, his first two observations under h1501 on sweeps 64 and 65 probably apply to NGC 4874. Heinrich d'Arrest made 7 observations of this galaxy and questioned if it was H. II-389?  Dreyer credited d'Arrest with the discovery in the NGC.


Heinrich d'arrest discovered 34 galaxies in the Coma cluster with an 11" refractor and Steinicke mentions he was the first to recognize the Coma assemblage of galaxies as a cluster (see NGC 4889 for his description), although Max Wolf is generally given credit in the literature based on his photograph in 1901 using the 16-inch Bruce double astrograph at the Heidelberg Observatory and following announcement "An extraordinary cluster of nebulae" (AN, 155, 127) .


"On two Bruce telescope photographs from March 24 of this year [1901] which depict the region surrounding 31 Comae Berenices, there is a very interesting area of the sky. There are numerous small nebulae so crowded together that when you look at the area you are startled by the strange appearance of this "cluster of nebulae". I have determined there are at least 108 nebulae in a circle of 30' diameter around the specified location, so in an area about the size of the full moon. Among them are four or five larger, centrally compressed nebulae [ellipticals], as well as several elongated ones [spirals]. The vast majority have roundish shape and are smaller."


Based on a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector, Heber Curtis (1918) wrote "this region contains the most remarkable aggregation of closely packed small nebulae known to me.  About 30 are catalogued in this area in the NGC and some 25 more are given in the IC.  In reality there are more the 300 small nebulae in an area about 50' x 40', a large proportion of which are probably spirals.  None of them are conspicuous objects."  An image in the paper highlights "249 small nebulae in an area 38' x 29'."

Heinrich d'Arrest found NGC 4882, along with NGC 4884, on 22 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  The offsets for these two objects - +3 sec in RA and -0.3' in dec, matches the differences between NGC 4886 (discovered by d'Arrest a year earlier) and NGC 4889 (discovered by WH).  But his RA was 7 sec too small for both galaxies.  So, NGC 4882 = NGC 4886 and NGC 4884 = NGC 4889.


The RNGC places NGC 4882 is 0.2 min of RA west of NGC 4886 but there is no galaxy near that position.  This error was mentioned in my RNGC Corrections #1 and the Webb Society Observer's Handbook #5, p158.

Henrich d'Arrest found NGC 4884, along with NGC 4882, on 22 Apr 1865 and noted "principal one of multiple nebulae.  One precedes [NGC 4882] by 2 or 3 sec."  His position is 7.5 sec of RA preceding NGC 4889, the only bright galaxy in the immediate vicinity, and his position for NGC 4882 is 7 sec of RA preceding NGC 4886.  So, NGC 4884 = NGC 4889 and NGC 4882 = NGC 4886.  d'Arrest listed 7 observations of NGC 4889, so NGC 4884 was an 8th observation.

This is the closest NGC companion to NGC 4889.  NGC 4882 is a third observation by d'Arrest of this galaxy on 22 Apr 1865, but with a relatively poor position (1.6' too far southwest), so he and Dreyer assumed it was new.  See that number.

Heinrich d'Arrest's NGC 4884 is a duplicate observation.  See that number for details.   d'Arrest commented that "The nebulae are incredibly numerous and dense and despite being faint, they have a diversity one cannot imagine a priori.  Sometimes, in the most favorable moments, I had the very definite impression that the nebulae, often only a few arcseconds in diameter, are intermingled with larger, roung, oblong, star-shaped or cometary ones, like oysters packed together in a barrel."

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4893 on 24 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His single position matches UGC 8111 and he noted it was between a mag 20 star south-preceding and a mag 17 star north following.  On the modern scale, both stars are mag(V) = 15-16.  Dreyer independently discovered this double galaxy on 1 Apr 1878 at Birr Castle.  While observing NGC 4914, he remarked, "about 7' p and 10' s is another; F, irr R, elongated north-south, *11-12m 1' nff and *14m 1' ssp."  These are the two stars noted by d'Arrest.


Max Wolf gave separate entries for the two components, which Dreyer catalogued as IC 4015 and IC 4016 (essentially at d'Arrest's position).  The two components were apparently seen by Dreyer ("elongated n-s") but not resolved. Corwin notes that the object Wolf identified as NGC 4893 is actually a plate defect, so he assumed the two separate components were new objects.

See observing notes for NGC 4898.  This number is misasigned to CGCG 160-247 = PGC 44732 in all modern catalogues.  My observations of this galaxy follow:


82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; fairly bright, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 20"x8", brighter nucleus.  Situated 0.8' NNW of NGC 4898 (double system) in the core of AGC 1656.


18" (4/20/12): this challenging galaxy is located just 45" NNW of brighter NGC 4898 and 1.9' ESE of NGC 4889 in the core of the Coma cluster.  At 282x it appeared extremely faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  The small dimensions imply I only picked up the brighter core and missed the extensions SW-NE.


17.5" (4/21/90): located in the core of AGC 1656 just 1.9' SE of NGC 4889.  Extremely faint, very small, round.  Forms a very close pair with NGC 4898 45" SE.  This is the third of four on line with NGC 4889 and NGC 4886 to the NE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4894 = h1510 on 13 Apr 1831 and recorded "the last of 5, south of a * 7m; more suspected to the south."  Since his 4th of 5 in the sweep (h1507) refers to NGC 4889, and he gave the declination as 1' south, Harold Corwin concludes that NGC 4894 is likely the earliest observation of NGC 4898, and not fainter CGCG 160-247 just 1' NW.  All modern sources take CGCG 160-247 as NGC 4894, but there does not appear to be a pre-NGC observation of this galaxy.


JH listed a second observation of h1510 on 30 Mar 1827, but that observation applies to NGC 4889.  He also attached his father's III-363 to h1510 in the GC (3354), but H III-363 likely applies to NGC 4908 (Dreyer assigned it to IC 4051 in his 1912 Correction list).


Because of the density of galaxies in the Coma cluster, there was a great deal of confusion on the identities!  Bigourdan and d'Arrest later measured an accurate position for NGC 4898 and both are credited in the NGC, so its identity is not in doubt.

Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4895 on 5 May 1864 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  His position (measured on 3 nights) matches UGC 8113 and he noted the mag 14-14.5 star (called mag 16) that follows by 8 sec of time.  The position in the UGC is 7' too far south.

82" (5/5/19, McDonald Observatory): at 613x; very easily resolved into two components [centers separated by 7" SW-NE].  The brighter southwestern component appeared bright, fairly small, round, very bright nucleus.  The northeastern component was moderately bright, small, round, slightly brighter nucleus.  Both galaxies were encased in a common halo.


PGC 44741, just 1.1' S, was fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 (central bar), slightly brighter nucleus.

PGC 44732, just 0.8' NNW, was fairly bright, fairly small, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 20"x8", brighter nucleus.  This galaxy is misidentified as NGC 4898 in modern sources.


18" (4/20/12): this double galaxy is the brightest close-in companion to NGC 4889 in the heart of the Coma cluster.  At 282x it appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, small, oval 4:3 E-W, mild concentration to the center.  Occasionally, the companion (NGC 4898B = LEDA 3098454) popped as a stellar or nearly stellar knot on the northeast end of the galaxy.  Located 2.5' SE of NGC 4889.


CGCG 160-247, just 45" NNW, is identified as NGC 4894 in modern sources.  At 282x, this challenging galaxy appeared extremely faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  The small dimensions imply I only picked up the brighter core and missed the extensions SW-NE.


17.5" (4/21/90): located in the central core of AGC 1656 cluster 2.5' SE of brightest member NGC 4889.  Faint, very small, slightly elongated.  This is the last of four on a line with NGC 4894 just 45" NW, NGC 4889 2.5' NW and NGC 4886 3.5' NW.


13.1" (5/14/83): faint, small, slightly elongated.  Located 3' SE NGC 4889 in AGC 1656.


John Herschel likely discovered NGC 4898 = h1510 on 13 Apr 1831 and recorded "the last of 5, south of a * 7m; more suspected to the south."  Since the 4th object in the sweep (h1507) refers to NGC 4889, and he reported the declination as 1' south, Harold Corwin concludes that h1510 (later NGC 4894) is likely the earliest observation of NGC 4898, and not fainter CGCG 160-247 just 1' NW. JH catalogued a second earlier observation of h1510 on 30 Mar 1827, but that refers to NGC 4889.  Heinrich d'Arrest made three fairly accurate measurements of this galaxy and questioned if it was h1510.


Because of the density of galaxies in the Coma cluster, there was a great deal of confusion on the identities!  Bigourdan and d'Arrest later measured an accurate position for NGC 4898 and both are credited in the NGC, so its identity is not in doubt.

48" (4/7/13): this unusual galaxy visually appears like a barred ring.  At 488x a bright nucleus is embedded with a weak bar, extending NW-SE.  A slightly brighter knot is situated close northwest of the nucleus.  A mag 11 star is attached at the southeast end of the galaxy, collinear with the "bar".  A large, round halo extends 1.7' and is slightly brighter along portions of the outer edge, forming a weak ring with a slightly darker interior on either side of the bar.


17.5" (5/22/93): fairly bright, moderately large, round, 1.5' diameter.  A mag 10.5 star is attached at the SE edge 41" from center.  Even surface brightness except for a faint slightly elongated "knot" just NW of center which may be the central bar or an offset nucleus.


8" (5/21/82): fairly bright, small.  Unusual appearance with a mag 10 star attached at the east edge and the galaxy extends to the west.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4900 = H I-143 = h1509 on 30 Apr 1786 (sweep 558) amd recorded "cB, just np a pB star and joining it as to appear like a brush to it."  In his 1814 PT paper he used this example and others to demonstrate a supposed union or attraction between the star and the nebula. JH made three observations and one description notes a "star 11m, with a fan or brush."


R.J. Mitchell, observing with LdR's 72" on 18 Apr 1855, recorded "Looks sometimes like the owl nebula when badly seen, with a B, E patch in centre and dark spots on each side of this; sometimes dark ring is seen all the way round, but blackest to [sp and nf]. Neby round is mottled."  On 24 Apr 1857 he logged "B centre is elongated in the direction of the star on edge and on either side of centre there certainly exist dark spaces as before remarked, giving it the look of the owl-neb.  Yet I sometimes thought I saw it as a sprial with a break in outer annulus npp."  The barred-ring structure in his sketch can be verified on the SDSS!

William Herschel discovered NGC 4908 = H III-363 on 11 Apr 1785 (sweep 396) and simply noted "vF".  Caroline's reduction matches UGC 8129.  This galaxy was probably found by d'Arrest on 22 Apr 1865, though his position is between NGC 4908 and slightly fainter MCG +05-31-090 = PGC 44828, located 2.3' north-northwest.  Dreyer used d'Arrest's position for NGC 4908, assuming it was more accurate.


Kobold and Bigourdan later observed both galaxies, but the position from Kobold for IC 4051 matches the brighter galaxy as he assumed the fainter galaxy was NGC 4908.  To further confuse the issue, John Herschel misassigned H. III-363 to h1510 = NGC 4894 -- see that number for additional problems! -- and this was copied into the GC.


Since William picked up the slightly brighter south-southeast galaxy (and presumably d'Arrest), NGC 4908 should apply to this galaxy, though modern catalogues reverse the identifications.   See Corwin's notes for more on this confusing story.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4910 = H V-3 on 24 Jan 1784 (sweep 123) and recorded "vL but eF, or I believe they are very close and vS stars."  The PT summary description reads "eF, vL, er, R, 7 or 8' dia."  In the NGC notes, Dreyer mentioned that Auwers' reduction is 10 min of RA too large.  This observation is from an early sweep (prone to errors) and in the 1912 revision of WH's catalogues, Dreyer also mentioned the following note from WH, "The place of this neb is not determined with accuracy" and there were no subsequent sightings by other observers.


Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 4910 may possibly be a duplicate observation of NGC 4845 (about 2.5 min of RA and 4' south of WH's rough position) as it is the "only reasonable candidate."

Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, found NGC 4912, along with NGC 4913, NGC 4916 and IC 4088, on 24 Apr 1865.  He assumed he was on the NGC 4914 field, but the discovery sketch, which shows 4 nebulae (and one suspected neb) is clearly a different field.


Sue French suggested that Parsons' field is 8° south of NGC 4914, where a very similar configuration of 4 galaxies is found, including a wide pair of stars that matches the diagram.  This implies NGC 4912 (labeled delta) = NGC 4922, NGC 4913 (labeled gamma) = IC 843, NGC 4916 (labeled epsilon) = CGCG 160-107 and the galaxy he assumed was NGC 4914 labeled beta) was IC 4088.  Harold Corwin notes some errors with his descriptions (epsilson is called the brightest) but the configuration strongly suggests these identifications.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4922 = UGC 8135 just 5 days earlier than Parsons' observation, but the other three galaxies should be credited to Parsons.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

This galaxy was probably discovered and sketched by Lawrence Parsons on 24 Apr 1865 along with NGC 4912 and NGC 4913 while observing the NGC 4914 field.  It is not identified as NGC 4916 in any modern catalogue


Lawrence Parsons discovered NGC 4916, along with NGC 4912, 4913 and IC 4088, on 24 Apr 1865 at Birr Castle.  His diagram, purportedly of the NGC 4914 field with NGC 4916 labeled epsilon, is a good match with CGCG 160-107 = PGC 44973, located roughly 8° south of the intended object.  He called this object "vF" and the faintest of the quartet.  Sue French suggested this identification.  The RNGC misidentifies PGC 44801, located 4.7' NNW of NGC 4914, as NGC 4916.  See NGC 4912.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4920 around 1882 while observing NGC 4933. In the narrative portion of list V, he remarked that several years earlier he found that NGC 4933 was double with the two components oriented southwest and northeast.  In a later observation he found another nebula, 1min 53s preceding and a little north of NGC 4933.  At this exact offset west and 7' north is MCG -02-33-094 = PGC 44958.


Guillaume Bigourdan found the galaxy on 16 Apr 1895, but misidentified his offset star.  Once corrected (see Harold Corwin's notes for the details), his position matches NGC 4920.  So, NGC 4920 = IC 4134.

18" (3/30/05): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~N-S, 0.7'x0.4'.  On sustained viewing, what appears to be the core or a compact galaxy, ~0.3' diameter, is on the SSW end.  A much lower surface brightness glow extends to the NNE, mimicking the appearance of a tiny comet.  Member of AGC 1656 (Coma Galaxy Cluster).  A mag 12 star lies 1.4' E.


Checking at home I found this was a double system (NGC 4922A = southern member, NGC 4922B = northern member) in a common halo with the brighter component on the south end so the visual description is fairly accurate.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4922 on 19 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and noted the mag 11-12 star that follows by 6 sec of RA.  His mean position (3 observations) is accurate.  The northern component of this double system is listed in NED as NGC 4922 NED02 and PGC 86794 in HyperLeda.  The position given here is on the SW component of this double system.


Sue French found that Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, probably independently discovered this galaxy just 5 days later, while looking for NGC 4912.  His field sketch does not match NGC 4912, but a quartet of galaxies 8° further south, including NGC 4922, IC 843, IC 4088 and CGCG 160-107.  NGC 4912 (labeled delta) matches NGC 4922.

At 488x, NGC 4933B appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 or 3:2 SW-NE, ~1.0'x0.7'.  Sharply concentrated with an intensely bright nucleus.  The north side has a sharper light cut off [due to dust].  Located 7' NE of mag 7.9 HD 113425.

On 16 Apr 1895, Bigourdan claimed he searched unsuccessfully for NGC 4933, but reported finding Big. 315 = IC 4173 and Big. 316 = IC 4176, which he noted were in PA 225° (SW-NE) and a separation of 1'.  His positions are wrong (over 2 min of RA too far east) as he misidentified his offset star, but once corrected they match the two components (nuclei) of NGC 4933!  These IC identifications were resolved in an e-mail correspondence between Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin in April 1998.  The RC3 labels IC 4173 = NGC 4933A and IC 4176 = NGC 4933B, with the two components first resolved by Tempel.  NGC 4933C was not discovered visually.

V = 8.6;  Size 20.0'x3.8';  Surf Br = 13.2;  PA = 43°


24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): remarkable spiral at 200x, extending southwest to northeast across 2/3 of the 30' field.  I didn't take detailed notes on this observation but there was just a broad concentration with no well defined core region.  The galaxy is very slightly wider through the center and only tapers towards the tips.  Along the south edge, just southwest of center, is a brighter linear streak forming a sharp edge (the dust lane is just beyond).  The main body of the galaxy fades a bit in this area and then brightens again further southwest.  The major axis appears slightly warped or bent towards the north near the northeast tip, due to a large dust patch that bites a notch into the galaxy.  On the south side of the northeast end, some very faint haze is visible.  The DSS image reveals this is a portion of the galaxy beyond the dust lane.  NGC 4945 is the second brightest member of the Centaurus A galaxy group and is situated 18' ENE of mag 4.8 Xi 1 Centauri.


13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): beautiful, huge edge-on spiral oriented SW-NE. At 166x, appears ~15'x2' with tapering tips that fade out towards the ends of the extensions.  There is only a broad concentration with a gently bulging core, although the surface brightness is somewhat irregular or mottled due to dust.  The galaxy fades a bit to the southwest of the core and then brightens slightly further southwest.  The northeast extension seems a bit splotchy or mottled.  I was very surprised that the view from Costa Rica was a bit better than from Bargo, outside of Sydney, with a similar aperture.


NGC 4945A, a challenging galaxy situated 17' SE of NGC 4945 and 13' N of mag 4.3 Xi 2 Centauri, appeared as a large, low surface brightness haze extending on the southwest side of mag 8.3 HD 113767.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this long edge-on spiral is fairly bright and broadly concentrated with a slightly bulging core, extending SW-NE ~14'x2.5'.  The surface brightness is relatively uniform with a weak central brightening and dimming towards the tips.  Set in a rich star field peppered with faint stars.  Located just north of a line connecting mag 4.8 Xi 1 Centauri 18' ESE and mag 4.3 Xi 2 31' SE.  NGC 4976 is situated 30' E.  Member of the Centaurus Group that includes both M83 and NGC 5128 and reddened by dust within our galaxy.  NGC 4945 is comparable in dimensions to NGC 4565 although the dust lane was not evident.


10x30mm Canon IS (3/28/19 - Tasmania): faint, large, very elongated glow.  Required a careful look to see off and on, but easy to identify as situated just 18' E of mag 4.8 Xi 1 Centauri.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 4945 = D 411 = h3459 on 29 Apr 1826. This is one of the first objects observed by Dunlop (2nd night in logbook) and the first galaxy he discovered, along with NGC 5128 the same night.  His description reads, "a beautiful long nebula, about 10' long, and 2' broad, forming an angle with the meridian, about 30 [degrees] south preceding and north following; the brightest and broadest part is rather nearer the south preceding extremity than the centre, and it gradually diminishes in breadth and brightness towards the extremeties, but the breadth is much better defined than the length. A small star near the north, and a smaller star near the south extremity, but neither of them is involved in the nebula. I have strong suspicions that the nebula is resolvable into stars, with very slight compression towards the centre. I have no doubt but it is resolvable. I can see the stars, they are merely points. This is north following the first zeta Centauri." Dunlop made a total of 7 observations and made a sketch (Figure 17).


John Herschel observed the galaxy on 31 Mar 1835 and recorded "B; vL; vmE; vglbM. Length much more than a diameter of the field, or than 15'. Its light extends to a star 14th mag beyond the parallel of Brisbane 4299. Position of elongation 38.7°."  He placed the galaxy 10' too far north.

See observing notes for NGC 4961.  Identification uncertain.


Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 4960 on 23 Apr 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen.  There is nothing at his single position, though 6 sec of RA east and 4' north is PGC 45312 (not in CGCG or MCG), which is identified as NGC 4960 in RNGC and PGC.  At mag B = 16.0-16.5, this galaxy may be too faint too have been picked up by d'Arrest and requires error in both RA and Dec, though Malcolm Thomson feels this identification is reasonable.


Bigourdan was unsuccessful in finding an object near d'Arrest's position.   Karl Reinmuth and Max Wolf (Kongistuhl-Nebel List #9) also couldn't identify this object on Heidelberg plates and Wolf felt that NGC 4960 was a duplicate of NGC 4961 (discovered by WH). Harold Corwin also concludes NGC 4960 is most likely NGC 4961 with a 15' error in the declination as d'Arrest recorded NGC 4960 "only once, on a night when he did not record NGC 4961 (he observed that on four other nights)."

William Herschel discovered NGC 4962 = H III-303 on 13 Mar 1785 (sweep 387) and recorded "eF, vS, 240x just verified."

NGC 4969 is a difficult double system in a common halo.  At 375x, the nucleus of the fainter companion was barely visible as a "bulge" on the east side of the main galaxy.  It was easier at  450x and occasionally appeared as a distinct quasi-stellar "knot" at the east edge of the glaaxy.  The centers of the pair are separated by only 10"-12"!

See observing notes for NGC 4954.


William Herschel discovered NGC 4972 = H III-937 on 5 May 1831 (sweep 1064) and noted "vF, S, iR, bM."  There is nothing at CH's reduced position.  But using offsets from different stars in the sweep, Dreyer gives two corrected positions in his notes to WH's third catalogue, and they match UGC 8157.  CH's reduced position was ~10' from this galaxy.


JH found this galaxy on 5 May 1831 and noted "The place is within barely possible limits of III. 937".  He repeated these suspicions in the notes to the GC, but added "they may be different, and are therefore separately listed."  Dreyer followed suit and added JH's observation as NGC 4954, though later realized the equivalence NGC 4954 = NGC 4972.  The primary designation of this galaxy is NGC 4954, although by historical precedence it should be NGC 4972.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4973 = H III-781 = Ho. 3-19 on 14 Apr 1789 (sweep 921) and recorded "Two [along with III-782 = NGC 4974], both vF, S.  The place is that of the 2nd [NGC 4974], the other is 3 or 4' sp."  Caroline Herschel's reduced position is 1.0 minute of time east of PGC 45280, but I re-reduced his offset with respect to NGC 4964 = H. III-779, the previous object in the sweep, and it is only 16 sec of RA east and 2' south of CGCG 270-051 = PGC 45321.  The only error is that NGC 4973 is 3.8' north-preceding, not south-preceding as WH stated. In any case, the positions for NGC 4973 and NGC 4974 were corrected by Rümker and repeated in the IC 2 Notes, so NGC 4973 = PGC 45280 = PGC 45299 and NGC 4974 = PGC 45321.


Lewis Swift found NGC 4973 again on 11 May 1890, reported Sw. IX-36 with a good position and Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 847 (though the IC position is closer to NGC 4974).  So, NGC 4973 = IC 847.  Herbert Howe found NGC 4973 again on 29 Jun 1900 and included it in his list 3-19, assuming NGC 4973 and 4974 were further east.  He stated in his notes that 3-19 was near IC 847, so Corwin concludes Howe probably misidentified NGC 4974 as IC 847.


The RNGC, RC3 and CGCG all misidentify NGC 4974 as NGC 4973.  MCG misidentifies MCG +09-22-011 as NGC 4973.  NGC 2000.0 and Dorothy Carlson incorrectly equate NGC 4974 = IC 847, instead of NGC 4973 = IC 847.  See Corwin's notes for more on this confusing situation!

NGC 4982

13 08 46.1 -10 35 19; Vir


= 4*, HC.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 4982 around 1878.  There is nothing at the NGC position except an asterism consisting of a small square (0.4' each side) of stars mag 13.7/14.7/15.8/16.4.  Corwin suggests this asterism may have appeared nebulous to Tempel.  Dreyer references his fifth discovery list (AN 2439) in the NGC, but Corwin was unable to find this object mentioned in the paper (I was also unsuccessful), so this identification is uncertain.

William Herschel discovered H II-815 on 26 Apr 1789 (sweep 929) and recorded "F, vS, stellar."  Re-reducing his position with respect to either 82 UMa (his reference star) or NGC 4998 (the previous object in the sweep), lands 2' southwest - within his typical errors - of CGCG 271-017 = MCG +09-22-020 = PGC 45564.


When JH examined the field, he recorded a nova (h1542) at the position of UGC 8216, which lies 8.5' southwest of CGCG 271-017, and logged "pF; S; R; 8-10"."  But when compiling the GC, he mistakenly decided h1542 was the same as his father's II-815 and combined both as GC 3424, using his position of h1542.  The GC description, "vF; vS; stellar", was probably meant to read "pF; vS; stellar", a synthesis of both descriptions.


Since Dreyer followed the GC, we are left with NGC 4987 = h1542 = UGC 8216.  Unfortunately, his father's H II-815 = CGCG 271-017 is left without a NGC designation.  Both Harold Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke agree with my analysis in an email exchange on 10 Jun 2014.  See Harold Corwin's full write-up.

William Herschel discovered NGC 4989 = H II-185 = Au 31 on 24 Apr 1784 (sweep 205) and recorded "F, S, irr, near a pB star."  His position is 20 sec of RA west and 3' north of PGC 45606.  The "pB star" is probably a mag 11.5 star 2.5' south.  Edward Cooper (or assistant Andrew Graham) also found this galaxy at the Markree Observatory on 9 Apr 1852 while measuring positions for the comprehensive Markree ecliptic Catalogue.  Auwers listed it in his 1862 catalogue of new nebulae, so it received a GC number (3426).  Heinrich d'Arrest measured an accurate position (on 4 nights) and discovered NGC 4990 7' north.  Dreyer combined the two GC entries in the NGC.

See observing notes for NGC 4993.


John Herschel discovered NGC 4994 = h3471 on 25 Mar 1836 and recorded "pF; R; slbM; 35"; among stars."  There is nothing near his position that he might have picked up.  ESO and PGC misidentify ESO 575-065, which is 0.4 min of RA west and 4' north of JH's position, as NGC 4994.  Although this is the closest galaxy, it is much too faint to be described as "pF".


Harold Corwin notes that NGC 4993 (discovered by WH) is exactly 50' south of JH's position and a much better match in description.  So, NGC 4993 = NGC 4994.

Burnham may have shown the galaxy to Edward Holden while visiting Washburn Observatory in 1881, as Holden included this object as #9 in his 1882 discovery list (Publ. of the Washburn Observatory, Vol I) though he noted "This nebula was first discovered by S. W. Burnham at the Dearborn Observatory, 1878, March 28."  Holden called it was "S, R, stellar nucleus."  Only Burnham was credited in the NGC.
