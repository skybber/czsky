Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 6002 on Apr 20 1873 while observing NGC 6001. He noted "Nova Pos 197.3° [SSW], distance 97.6” [~1.6']."  A mag 16.7 star is fairly close to his offset at PA 190° and separation 116" [~1.9'].


MCG and PGC identify MCG +05-37-026 = PGC 56051 as NGC 6002.  This dim edge-on is situated 57" southwest of NGC 6001 in PA 225°, a poor match with Parsons' position and likely too faint to have been picked up, even in the 72".  Harold Corwin suggests the faint star is more likely NGC 6002, thought it too is quite faint. So perhaps Parsons made some type of error such as misidentifying NGC 6001.


Karl Reinmuth reported "no neb 100" S of NGC 6001" based on his photographic survey at Heidelberg (repeated by Dorothy Carlson) and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent with the comment NGC 6002 = NGC 6001.

A wide pair of mag 10.5 stars [~27" separation] is off the southwest side.  The cluster is pretty rich, with many stars arranged in two intersecting strings.  A thin, winding chain of stars extends N-S through the center.  A second strip of stars bisects this chain, angling WNW to ESE.  The central 45" of the cluster is fairly dense, with ~15 stars packed into this region.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6005 = D 334 = h3615 on 8 May 1826 and described "a faint round nebula, about 1.5' diameter, very slightly bright towards the centre. A small star is south, rather preceding the nebula, and Iota Normae is south following."  His position is 15' east of the cluster.


JH first observed the cluster on 9 Jul 1834 and recorded "a milky way cluster; but so densely concentrated as to merit as a fine cluster VI class; irregularly round, gbM, stars 11..15th mag."  On a second sweep he noted "cluster, small, irregularly round, gbM, a group or rather a small oval pretty much compressed cluster of stars 16..17th mag. A few = 15th mag."

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x using a 27mm Panoptic, this cluster was a very pretty sight.  It appeared loose but bright and large, ~13' diameter, with 50-60 stars resolved.  A couple of dozen stars are mag 11.5 or brighter and seem to form a continuous loop or exaggerated "S" shape with no central concentration!  At 128x, ~80 stars were visible but the cluster was really too large for a good view at this power.  Two brighter mag 7 and 8 stars are at the SE end (HD 143448, the northern one, is the brightest in the cluster and a Be type) with mag 8.5 and 9 stars near the NW edge.


The cluster straddles TrA and Norma and was just visible naked-eye.  Abell 3627 (the core of the "Great Attractor"!) lies 1.5 degrees southeast and deep images show a number of very faint galaxies within and around the borders of the cluster that are probably outlying members.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6025 = Lac III 10 = D 304 = h1941 in 1751-1752 using a 1/2" telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope. With this small telescope he noted "three faint stars in line in nebulosity."  Dunlop observed the cluster 5 times with his 9-inch reflector from Parramatta and recorded "(Lambda Circini) Lacaille describes this as three small stars in a line with nebula. No particular nebula exists in this place. A group of about twenty stars of mixt magnitudes, forming an irregular figure, about 5' or 6' long, answer to the place of the Lambda. This is in the milky way; and there is no nebula in the group of stars except what is common in the neighbourhood."


John Herschel lists 4 observations in the Cape Catalogue: on his first sweep (22 Apr 1835) he logged "VII.; loose; scattered; brilliant; stars large; much more than fills field; 46 stars counted above 12th mag; chief star 7th mag taken."

John Herschel discovered NGC 6026 = h3617 on 8 Jun 1837 and recorded "F; S; R: 15"; gpmbM.  There are 3 stars forming a triangle about 60°, np the nebula."  His position is at the west edge of the planetary.


NGC 6026 was misclassified as an elliptical galaxy in the 1932 Shapley-Ames catalog, with dimensions 1.0'x0.8', mag(p) = 12.5.  In the course of a photographic survey of bright southern galaxies at Mt Stromlo, de Vaucouleurs noticed the appearance suggested it might be a galactic PN.  He notified Nicholas Mayall of Lick Observatory who obtained a spectrogram, which established it was a planetary nebula (announced in 1955PASP...67..418D).  de Vaucouleus omitted it from the 1964 Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies as well as Alan Sandage in the 1981 revised S-A catalogue.

48" (5/15/12): the brightest components of Seyfert's Sextet were NGC 6027 = HCG 79b and NGC 6027A = HCG 79a.  Both were moderately bright at 610x, though NGC 6027 was more elongated at 2:1 E-W, ~20"x10".  NGC 6027E, a diffuse plume, was easily visible extending 30" NE and narrowing near the end where it brightens slightly. NGC 6027D = HCG 79e is situated barely off the south side and appeared faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter.  NGC 6027B = HCG 79c (third brightest member) is just 24" W and appeared fairly faint, small, oval 3:2 SW-NE, 18"x12".  Finally NGC 6027C = HCG 79d is furthest south (fifth brightest) and appeared faint, fairly small, very elongated 4:1 N-S, ~25"x7", with a low, nearly even surface brightness.


18" (8/3/05): at 257x, the brightest component of Seyfert's Sextet appeared faint, very small, slightly elongated ~E-W, 15"x10", contains a faint stellar nucleus with direct vision.  A mag 14.5 star lies 1' ESE and two additional mag 14.5 stars lie close SE.  Just resolved from HCG 79c which lies 22" W of center.


18" (6/20/04): at 320x, a trio of galaxies forming a small equilateral triangle were fairly easily resolved with careful viewing.  The brightest of the trio (HCG 79b) is at the NE corner and appeared elongated 3:2 E-W, ~20"x13".  The other two members (HCG 79a and HCG 79c) are both extremely small, round, ~10" diameter.  Two mag 14.5 stars 1'-1.5' SE are collinear with HCG 79b and a slightly brighter mag 14 star lies 2' W.


17.5" (5/14/88): faint, small, elongated ~E-W.


17.5" (6/6/86): this is Seyfert's Sextet = HCG 79, an extremely compact group!  On close inspection, the confused "clump" resolves into three components with the brightest component (HCG 79b) appearing fairly faint, small.  Extremely close are HCG 79a = NGC 6027A just 36" SSW and HCG 79c = NGC 6027B 22" W of center.  A mag 14.5 star is 1.1' ESE and other faint stars are near.  These three galaxies are just resolved at 220x.


13" (6/18/85): slightly elongated E-W.


13" (5/26/84): faint, very small, irregularly round, weak concentration.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6027 = St XII-78 on 20 Mar 1882 and measured an accurate position.  Although Stephan recorded this ultra-compact group as only a single entry, his description "eF, vF* inv, 2 vF st nr" implies he probably resolved two or three members.  Barnard ran across NGC 6027 while sweeping on 29 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.


Carl Seyfert's name was attached after his 1951 paper "A Dense Group of Galaxies in Serpens" (PASP...63...72S).  Different lettering of the components were introduced by VV, RNGC and Hickson, so there is often confusion on the designations.  There are likely only 4 galaxies in the group as NGC 6027D has a discordant redshift over four times the other members and NGC 6027E is considered either a tidal tail of HCG 79b or a partially dissolved remnant.  Seyfert's Sextet is probably the densest (most compact) galaxy aggregate in the local Universe with all 4 members fitting within the confines of the Milky Way.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6039 = Sw. IV-21 on 27 Jun 1886 on the west side of the Hercules Galaxy Cluster and recorded "eeeF; vS; R; sp of 3 in a line, the other 2 being 2 of Stephan's, 3rd of 10."  The three galaxies near his position are NGC 6040, 6041 and 6042, with NGC 6042 (the south-following of 3) 14 sec of RA east of Swift's position.  He also added a note that "three of the ten of more nebulae in this interesting group are M. Stephan's, presumably [NGC 6040] and certainly [NGC 6041] and [NGC 6042].  Two or 3 more are suspected.  They are very difficult objects to see and especially to measure, atmospheric condition seldom allowing them to be seen at all except Stephan's last two, which are quite interesting objects, but those he describes as faint and small and very small, I call pretty large."


Despite Swift's note, NGC 6039 is mostly likely is a duplicate of NGC 6042, which is the third in a line with NGC 6040 and 6041, though his description should reads "sf of 3."  RNGC misidentifies NGC 6040B = MCG +03-41-073 as NGC 6039.  This galaxy is attached to the southwest end of NGC 6040.

13.1" (5/14/83): very faint, elongated.  Second of four in subgroup of AGC 2151.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6045 = Sw. IV-24 on 27 Jun 1886, along with several other members of the Hercules Galaxy Cluster.  He logged "eeF; vS; R; v diff; 6th of 10." and his position is 13 seconds of RA preceding UGC 10177 (a similar offset as NGC 6043).  Bigourdan measured an accurate position in June 1888 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

William Herschel discovered NGC 6046 = H III-33 on 14 Mar 1784 (sweep 171) and recorded "A nebula suspected by 157 and the suspicion strengthened by 240; but the latter power does not remove all doubt.  It follows 3 pB stars making an arch [concave towards np or nnp direction by a diagram], south of which arch there is a still brighter star."


There is nothing near WH's offset, but based on his description of the nearby stars, Harold Corwin identifies NGC 6046 = NGC 6028 (correctly placed by Bigourdan).  This galaxy is nearly 3.5 min of RA west of WH's position.  The 3 stars are actually concave to the northeast and the "still brighter star" is mag 9.0 HD 143614.  RNGC classifies the number nonexistent (Type 7).

On 14 May 1855 LdR noted the "star looked quite sharp and well defined in the finding eyepiece", but on 26 May 1875 Lawrence Parsons commented "*7-8m with vF surrounded atmosphere which could be traced about 1' from the star."  Two days later, Henry Chamberlain Russell of Sydney Observatory was also shown the star and the entry reads "Mr. H.C.

48" (5/15/12): this is an interconnected pair of galaxies with the brighter component (NGC 6050A) on the northeast side.  The pair appeared as a moderately bright, irregular glow, slightly elongated SW-NE, and roughly 60"x45". They were not individually separated at 375x although NGC 6050A has a slightly brighter nucleus and NGC 6050B (often called IC 1179) is a faint, diffuse glow attached to its southwest side.  NGC 6050B displayed a very weak central brightening and a very faint nucleus.  This double system is centered in an amazingly rich field of galaxies, the closest being PGC 1540468, just 45" S.


17.5" (5/13/88): very faint, small, round, diffuse.  This member of AGC 2151 forms a close pair with NGC 6054 1.9' ENE.  Follows the trio of NGC 6047 4.0' SW, NGC 6045 3.8' W and NGC 6043 5.3' WNW.  This is an interacting pair with IC 1179 20" SW (not individually resolved).

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6050 = Sw. IV-26 on 27 Jun 1886, along with several additional members of the Hercules Galaxy Cluster.  He logged "eeeF; S; R; e diff.; 8th of 10." and his position is 13 seconds west of UGC 10186 (a similar offset in RA as NGC 6043, 6045 and 6047).  Bigourdan measured an accurate RA on 1 Jun 1888 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).


Swift "discovered" the galaxy again on 3 Jun 1888 and reported it in list VII-71 (this time described as "11th of 12").  Dreyer added this second entry as IC 1179.  Most modern sources including PGC, HyperLeda and SIMBAD misidentify the southwest component (NGC 6050B) as IC 1179.  It's extremely unlikely that IC 1179 refers to the southwest galaxy in list VII, as Swift described NGC 6050 as "eeeF" and NGC 6050B is much fainter and he makes no mention of the nebula being double!

48" (4/5/13): the main glow of this disrupted system or merger appeared fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, irregular or mottled.  The glow brightens along the eastern side and very thin, faint extensions protrude along the eastern side to the north and south (more prominent on the south end).  The appearance is similar to an edge-on galaxy attached to the larger, mottled western component.


48" (5/15/12): at 488x, the disrupted system NGC 6052 = Arp 209 had a very strange appearance.  Attached on the southeast side is a faint, elongated glow, ~22"x6", extending out from the main portion of the system and giving the strong impression that an edge-on galaxy was involved in this merger.  Also on the northeast side, a fainter and broader extension or plume was visible oriented N-S.  Although these two features seemed detached, they may be part of the same partially merged galaxy.  To the west of these extended features is the most prominent region or core of the galaxy, which appeared bright, irregular round and mottled.  The halo was very irregular in shape and brightness, particularly on the west side which had a mottled, tattered appearance.


24" (7/23/14): using 375x, moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 N-S, ~25"x18".  Contains an extremely small nucleus that appears offset to the north side.

24" (6/28/14): at 375x, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 N-S, 30"x20", contains a quasi-stellar nucleus and mottled core that is slightly displaced to the north side.  The two components were not clearly resolved.


18" (7/12/10): fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 N-S, 0.9'x0.3', fairly even surface brightness except at 285x and 335x there was a very faint, slightly brighter "bulge" or knot on the west side (VV 86a) in the direction of a faint star 45" W.  On the SDSS, this is a highly disrupted system with jets or knots of material appearing to shoot out on the west side.


17.5": fairly faint, fairly small, oval ~N-S, bright core.  Appears asymmetric as the galaxy is brighter on the west side. The POSS reveals this is an attached contact system (Arp 209).  A mag 14.5 star is 1' W.

Albert Marth found NGC 6052 = m302 on 2 Jul 1864 and recorded "F, about 1' diameter, irr R, ??III. 140 [NGC 6064]."


WH discovered H III-140 = NGC 6064 on 11 Jun 1784 (sweep 225), but his position was 1 min 47 sec of RA too large, so Marth was uncertain if H. III-140 was the same nebula.  Dreyer concluded in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that this number "is no doubt = NGC 6052 (Marth 302).  H did not observe the neb in the centre of the field but applies a correction of -0.7m, which appears to have been too small."

His position is 13 seconds west of CGCG 108-128 = PGC 57073 (similar offset as NGC 6043, 6045, 6047, 6050) and his comment "faint star very near south-preceding" applies (the star is 1' southwest).


His position, though, happens to fall closer to fainter CGCG 108-121, and MCG, PGC and RNGC misidentify CGCG 108-121 as NGC 6054. But if this was the case, the star would be southeast and he would have picked up brighter CGCG 108-121 in any case.

Assuming he picked up the brighter of these two galaxies on the first night, then NGC 6057 = UGC 10191.  Two nights later he logged both galaxies and placed them 5 seconds apart in RA (the actual separation is 7 seconds).

On 5 Apr 1851, his brother Bindon wrote, "like [NGC 2392], dark ring plainer seen on preceding part of neb; vS * north, about 3/4' diam of neb off.  The following part of dark ring a little broader than the preceding part."  Samuel Hunter made a sketch on 9 May 1861 and this was included at the last minute in the 1861 publication.


The spectrum was recognized as a PN by Campbell and Moore.  Based on a Crossley photograph at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "an irregular oval fading out at ends of major axis, brightest at north and south edges; 25"x20" in pa 77°."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6059 = Sw. III-91 on 6 May 1886 and recorded "vF; S; R."  There is nothing near his position.  Bigourdan claimed he found NGC 6059 12 seconds of RA after the NGC position (20 Apr 1891 Comptes Rendus), but there is nothing at his position except 3 stars 1.5' north.  Jeff Corder suggested NGC 6059 might apply to the faint double star about 25 seconds further west (and 1' north).  In any case, there are no nearby galaxies Swift might have seen.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6064 = H III-140 on 11 Jun 1784 (sweep 225) and recorded "vF, vS, r, 240 verified it; np a pB star, with another equally B st in the field sp the former; also several eS stars in the field."  There is nothing near his position and III-140 was not found by Bigourdan."  But 1 min 47 sec of RA preceding his position (CH's reduction) is UGC 10182.  Dreyer concludes in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that this number "is no doubt = NGC 6052 (Marth 302).

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): this stunning cluster was partially resolved in my 15x50 IS binoculars.  At 110x a few hundred stars were resolved and formed a gorgeous group.  A striking 11" pair (h4835) is in the center with the western star a noticeable orange color.  Just south of the eastern star is a fainter, third close companion and several other pairs are in the vicinity.  The cluster is compressed in the center with a number of curving chains and loops of stars that appear to spiral out into the periphery.  Located 25' N of mag 5 Kappa Normae.


18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x (27 Panoptic), this cluster was a stunning sight with a few hundred stars sparkling in a 20' region.  NGC 6067 appeared comparable to one the richer Messier clusters.  The cluster is compressed towards the center and thins out in the periphery, blending in with the rich, surrounding Milky Way.  The cluster includes a few striking pairs with a bright mag 8.8/9.4 pair at 10" near in the center,  The duo is collinear with a much closer and fainter equal mag pair.  At 228x, the cluster appeared much more irregular and most of the stars seemed to be arranged in elegant loops and chains that enclosed starless holes in the cluster.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): At 83x, in excess of 100 stars mag 8-12 in a 20' diameter.  Very bright, large, very rich, compressed towards the core, which includes a striking double star at center (h4835 = 8.8/9.4 at 10").  Many stars are arranged in spirals and arcs, rich in faint stars.  The brightest mag 7.8 star is located at the south edge with a mag 8 star off the east edge.  This is a beautiful open cluster in the rich Norma starcloud!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6067 = D 360 = h3619 on 8 May 1826 and described "a pretty large cluster of small stars of mixed magnitudes, about 12' diameter; the stars are considerably congregated towards the centre, extended south preceding and north following."  He made 5 observations of the cluster and his position is unusually accurate.


John Herschel made 3 observations: On 9 Jul 1834 he recorded "the chief star in middle of a most superbly rich and large cluster, 20' at least in diameter, as it much more than fills field; not much compressed in the middle, stars 10..12th mag." On a second sweep he called it "place of a near double star in centre of a superb cluster; very large and rich; composed of equal stars 12th mag, a fine object, Much more than fills field."

48" (5/9/18): at 375x; even in poor seeing NGC 6070 revealed three spiral arms or arcs of arms as well as a couple of HII knots. The galaxy appeared bright, large, elongated nearly 2:1 ~SW-NE, ~3'x1.5'.  An inner spiral arm was visible on the NE side of the bright core.  It showed a "hard" outer edge that defined the arm and contrasted with an obvious darker gap (dust) that was between this arm and an outer spiral arm.  The outer arm seemed to emerge just north of the inner arm and gently curved counterclockwise towards the east and bending south near its tip.  This outer arm ended at a very faint, small HII knot labeled as region I in the 2010 paper "Giant HII regions in NGC 7479 and NGC 6070".  Just outside the northeast curve of this arm was a second, slightly brighter HII knot, 6"-10" diameter (identified as region IV).  Another inner spiral arc was symmetrically placed to the SW side of the core. It was pretty ill-defined, though, and lacked a sharp edge.


NGC 6070B is a close double system 4.3' NE of NGC 6070.  The cores were easily resolved at 16" separation N-S.  The southern component (NGC 6070B NED2) was larger and appeared fairly faint, round, 0.4' diameter, small bright core.  The northern component (NGC 6070B NED1) was also fairly faint and round, but smaller - about 15" diameter.  NGC 6070C, just 1.3' NE [PA 35°], was brighter than either component of NGC 6070B and appeared  moderately bright, fairly small, round, 20" diameter, moderately high surface brightness.


24" (6/28/14): fairly bright, large, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, 2'x1', contains a large brighter core, fades out around the periphery. A very faint "star" seen near the northeast tip is actually a compact HII region labeled as region IV in the 2010 paper.  Located 8' SE of mag 6.7 HD 145204.

NGC 6070B appeared very faint, small, elongated 2:1 ~N-S, low surface brightness.  This is a close double system and the noted elongation implies both systems were visible, but not individually resolved.  NGC 6070C was extremely faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.  The fainter companions are much more distant at ~590 million l.y., compared to NGC 6070 (~100 million l.y.).


17.5" (6/11/88): fairly bright, large, oval 2:1 SW-NE, broad moderate concentration.  Brightest of trio with NGC 6070B 4.3' NE and 6070C 5.6' NE.  Located 7.9' SW of mag 7 SAO 121396.

24" (7/24/14): moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30" diameter, increases to a very small bright core and down to a stellar nucleus.  This is dominant component of a very close pair with MCG +02-41-018 attached to the south-southeast side, just 25" between centers!  The companion appeared faint, very small, round, 12" diameter, occasional stellar nucleus.  The pair was just resolved at 260x.  NGC 6074, another double system, lies 12' WNW.  NGC 6078 is the brightest in the USGC U751 group at z = .032, which includes NGC 6074, NGC 6083 and CGCG 079-073.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6079 = H III-884 on 6 May 1791 (sweep 1005) and noted "vvF, vS, 300 verified it very plainly, and showed it of a considerable size."  His position is 1 min of RA east and 2' south of UGC 10206 (similar offset as H. III 883 = NGC 6071, the previous object in the sweep).  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 18 Jul 1884 (repeated in the IC 2 notes).


Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy on 2 Aug 1888 (and discovered IC 1201 to the southeast) and reported it in list VII-77 (later IC 1200).  His position is a close match with NGC 6079, as well as his relative offset from IC 1201.  Dreyer must have felt Swift's VII-77 was a new object because of the different position for H. III-884.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6080 = Sw. VI-87 on 30 Mar 1887 and recorded "pB; pS; R; mbM."  His position is 6 seconds west of UGC 10268.  Herbert Howe, observing with the 20-inch refractor in Denver in 1900, commented "this is accompanied by a star of mag 12.5, 20" distant at 45°, which appeared to be nebulous."  The "star" is actually the compact companion PGC 93131.

The cluster contains several bright stars, including S Normae (Cepheid that varies from 6.1-6.8 over 10 days) and three mag 8-9 stars just south.  Many of the stars in the cluster form an arrowhead outline with the vertex at the north end.  Also a bright string of stars is off the SW end of the arrowhead aligned N-S.  Impressive cluster although there are no dense spots.

John Herschel credited Dunlop with the discovery and made two observations: on 22 Apr 1835 he logged "Cluster VIII class, large, loose, brilliant, irregular figure, fills field, chief star about 7th mag taken." On a second sweep he called it "Cluster VIII; large, coarse, bright, fills field, stars 7, 8, 9, 10th mag; a star about 7th mag taken."

Arthur von Auwers discovered a nova (T Sco = Nova Scorpii 1860) in M80 on 21 May 1860 at Konigsberg Observatory.  The magnitude was estimated between 6.5 and 7.0, as bright as the entire cluster.  It was seen by N.R. Pogson on 28 May, while observing the variables R and S Sco, which share the same field.  He reported being started by the appearance of a mag 7.6 star in the place of the cluster!  Pogson assumed it was a new variable precisely along our line of sight to M80.  T Sco is probably the first known variable star to be associated with a cluster.

16 25 48.5 -72 12 05; Aps

V = 9.2;  Size 10.7';  Surf Br = 0.1


18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x; fairly large but apparently loose globular with about two dozen stars resolved and little central concentration.  At 228x at least three dozen stars mag 14 and fainter were resolved including a clump of faint stars near the center.  At this power the periphery is quite irregular and ragged with most of the brighter resolved stars hugging close to the edges of the halo.  A group of brighter mag 11 field stars are just off the NNE side.  A mag 10 star lies 8' NW of center and a similar star is placed 7' SE.  Located 28' SE of a mag 6.7 star.


18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x appears moderately bright, fairly large, round, 4'-5' diameter.  This globular has an unusual appearance, as there was only a weak concentration except for a very small brighter nucleus.  At 228x many mag 14-15 stars are superimposed over the background glow while a number of faint stars huddle around the edges of the halo.  Several of the faint, resolved stars reside very near the center and these may have been the "very small brighter nucleus" I noticed at only 128x.


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 140x this moderately faint globular is ~4' diameter with just a weak concentration.  A scattering of mag 14 stars pepper the face of the cluster and at the edges of the irregular halo.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6101 = D 68 = h3623 on 1 Jun 1826 and recorded "A pretty large rather faint round nebula, about 3.5-4' diameter, a little brighter in the middle. There is a very small nebula on the N.p. side joining the margin of the large nebula."  Dunlop's position is off by a relatively small 4'.


On 18 Jun 1835, John Herchel recorded "Globular cluster, large, faint, round, very gradually a little brighter in the middle, all resolved into stars 15..18th mag, 4' diam, with stragglers. A delicate and beautiful object."  A week later he called it "pretty bright, large, irregularly round, gradually brighter in the middle, resolved into stars 13..16th mag; pretty compressed, diam 5' or 6' by estimation, approx. 50 seconds in RA. A fine object."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6111 = Sw. IX-57 on 31 May 1887 and recorded "vF; pS; lE; D * nr south points to it."  The NGC position, based on personal correspondence from Swift to Dreyer, is in error.  His published position in his 9th discovery list is nearly a degree further north and corresponds with CGCG 320-014 = PGC 57579.  His comment "D[ouble] * nr south points to it" clinches this identification, as a faint double star 3' south (mag 13/14.5 at 18") is collinear with the galaxy.  Dreyer published a correction to Swift's position in the IC I Notes section.  Bigourdan's "corrected" position from 1 May 1897 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) is wrong and corresponds with a star.


MCG and CGCG fail to label CGCG 320-014 as NGC 6111 and the first edition of the Uranometria 2000 Atlas misplots NGC 6111.  RNGC misidentifies IC 1210 (10' N of Swift's original position) as NGC 6111.  Coincidentally, Swift discovered IC 1210 and placed it correctly in his 9th list.  The identification errors were covered in Malcolm Thomson's unpublished "Catalogue Corrections", my RNGC Corrections #5 list and Harold Corwin's identification notes.

24" (8/16/12): M4 displayed several orange/red supergiants, including the brightest star (mag 12) within the central bar.  This star is situated at the northern intersection point of the bar and the partial oval ring of stars that extends mostly to the east of the bar.  Another orange star is on the southwest side of the core, 4' from center.  A bright, orange mag 10 star is on the SSW side of the halo, 6.5' from center.  A wide, bright pair of orange stars (10.8/10.9 at 17") is SE of the bar (1.8' from center).


18" (7/12/07): at 225x, the remarkable 10' central region is bounded by a nearly complete ring of stars with a prominent string (bar) of brighter stars oriented SSW-NNE nearly bisecting the central region.  The center of this ridge of stars is intersected by a dense, elongated ring of stars with major axis E-W, with the majority of the stars to the east of the bar. A wide, brighter pair of stars (10.8/10.9 at 17") to the SE of the bar has an orange tint.  Sprays of stars appear to emanate from the bar in all directions with a beautiful arc of stars curving along the entire north side of the core.  The outer halo is relatively sparse but includes a number of brighter stars and appears to extend 15'-18' in diameter.


17.5" (7/4/86): very bright, very large, 15' diameter.  Resolved into an extremely dense swarm of several hundred stars with many stars arranged in strings.  Appears fully resolved at moderate power including the distinctive bar extending N-S through the center.  M4 is possibly the closest GC at a distance of 5600 light-years.


13.1" (6/19/82): the core is beautifully resolved including the bar which resolves into a number of faint stars.  The halo is fully resolved with many star lanes.


8" (6/19/82): superb resolution of mag 11-13 stars.


Philippe de Chéseaux discovered M4 = NGC 6121 = Lac I-9 in 1745-46.  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille found it again in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  William Herschel didn't catalogue M4 as he tried to avoid repeating the Messier objects but described M4 as "a rich cluster of considerably compressed small stars surrounded by many straggling ones.  It contains a ridge of stars running through the middle from south preceding to north following.  The ridge contains 8 or 10 pretty bright stars.  All the stars are red."  He noted in his 1814 publication that the observed red color was probably owing to the low elevation of M4, though there is one conspicuous red star in the bar. John Herschel has no entry in his Cape of Good Hope catalogue, though he undoubtedly observed this showpiece.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 6122 = Big 78 on 6 May 1886.  There is nothing at his Comptes Rendus (5 Dec 1887) position but his corrected position 6' further north (published in the Corrections table of his 1 Jul 1901 Comptes Rendus paper) matches MCG +06-36-032 = PGC 57858.  The MCG doesn't label this galaxy with the NGC designation. See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

V = 5.8;  Size 29'


25" (4/5/19 - OzSky): gorgeous open cluster at 102x (31mm Nagler) and 244x (13mm Ethos). with several hundred resolved stars within a 25' field.  Contains a very large number (perhaps 30) of 9th and 10th magnitude stars.  There is a condensed group of roughly 3 dozen stars in the center, many forming easy but eye-catching pairs.  The central stars are distributed irregularly with a nearly vacant lane running roughly NW to SE.  The "halo" stars are spread out fairly evenly and a roughly circular outline of ~25'.  Two 10" pairs forming a wide "double-double" is close east of the central group.


13.1" (6/18/85): bright, fairly rich, large, roughly 125 stars are resolved.


8" (6/27/81): fairly large but scattered, richer in center.


16x80mm (6/18/85): this bright cluster appears partially resolved even in my 16x80 finder.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6124 = Lac I-8 = D 514 = h3626 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x.  During his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope he catalogued "a fairly big tailless comet."  James Dunlop observed it on 10 May 1826 as "a round cluster of small stars of nearly equal magnitudes, about 12' diameter, considerably congregated to the centre, not rich in small stars. This answers to the place of 44 Normae, but there is no nebula."  Dunlop made a total of 5 observations and his position is accurate.


On 5 Jun 1834 (sweep 456), John Herschel logged "Viewed; a brilliant cluster class VII.; p rich, L, irregularly scattered, fills field, stars 8,9,10,11th mag."  On 4 Aug 1834 he recorded the cluster as "cluster, bright, large, loosely scattered, not much compressed in the middle, fills nearly a field, consists of about 50 or 60 stars 9..11th mag."

William Herschel discovered NGC 6125 = H II-810 on 24 Apr 1789 (sweep 928) and noted "pF, pS, lE."  His position is close to NGC 6130 = UGC 10347 (independently discovered by Lewis Swift) but Dreyer assumed that WH made a 20' error in dec (partly because Bigourdan was unsuccessful on 4 attempts at WH's position) and that II-810 referred to NGC 6127 = NGC 6128 = UGC 10345.


But in an email on 28 Jan 2013, Steinicke wrote, "I've now detected that [UGC 10345] could not be seen by WH: It was well outside (north) of his sweep 928!  Moreover, the zone of this 12 mag galaxy was never swept, so he could not find it. His position, based on the 5th mag reference star of Bode's catalogue (SAO 29727), clearly points to NGC 6130 [UGC 10347], located 24' south. His description "pF, pS, lE" matches the elongated object, whereas [UGC 10345] is brighter and round. That he does not mention the 9 mag star 3' west is nothing special. There is no PD error! The position of NGC 6088 (III 812), based on the same star is also pretty good. Another position, relative to Mu Draconis, confirms both nebulae.


This galaxy was also found twice by Swift on 6 Jul 1886 and on 28 Jun 1886, so it received two more NGC numbers, NGC 6127 = Sw. IV-29 and NGC 6128 = Sw. IV-30, respectively.  Swift's positions and description make it clear he saw the same galaxy.  Karl Reinmuth equated NGC 6125 = NGC 6130, which coincidentally has the same dec as H's original position but is 50 seconds of RA east of the NGC position for NGC 6125.  See Corwin's notes.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6127 = Sw. IV-29 on 6 Jul 1886 and logged "pF; vS; R."  His position matches UGC 10345.  He found this galaxy again just 3 weeks later (28 Jul) and recorded it as Sw. IV-30 = NGC 6128.  His positions and descriptions are nearly identical, so it seems odd that neither Swift nor Dreyer suggested the equivalence NGC 6127 = NGC 6128.


It's been assumed that this galaxy was first discovered by WH and catalogued as H II- 810 = NGC 6125 with a 20' error in declination.  But Wolfgang Steinicke has shown that WH could not have seen this galaxy, as it is too far north in his sweep.  Instead, WH II-810 refers to NGC 6130 = UGC 10347.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6128 = Sw. IV-30 on 28 July 1886 and logged "pF, pS, R, bM."  His position is less than 1' northeast of the center of UGC 10345.  He discovered this galaxy just 3 weeks earlier on 6 July 1886 and included it in the same list as Sw. IV-29 = NGC 6127.  Neither Swift nor Dreyer assumed an equivalence, although the positions and descriptions are very similar.  So, NGC 6128 = NGC 6127.

But according to Wolfgang Steinicke, William Herschel discovered this galaxy on 24 Apr 1789 (sweep 928) and noted II-810 as "pF, pS, lE."  Wolfgang states that WH's offset from SAO 29727 matches UGC 10347.  In this case, NGC 6130 = NGC 6125.

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x, NGC 6134 is a bright, fairly large open cluster, at least 10' diameter, with roughly 150 stars resolved from mag 10 and fainter.  Many of the stars are arranged in chains, loops and rings although there was no central concentration.  The brightest mag 9.3 star (HD 148076) is on the SE side of the cluster, about 4' from the center.  The Norma Milky Way background is very rich in this region.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6134 = D 412 = h3627 on 10 May 1826 and described as "a pretty large round nebula, about 4' diameter, gradually a little brighter towards the centre.  There is a small star on the north, and another on the south side, both involved.  This is easily resolved into stars, with slight compression to the centre."  His position is 6' too far northeast.


On 5 Jul 1834, JH recorded "a pretty rich loose large, roundish cluster of stars 12..14th mag, 7' diameter, not m comp M." On 15 Apr 1836 he called it "VII class, rich, L, gradually a little compressed in the middle, irregularly round, 12', stars 13,14,15th mag, nearly fills field."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6135 = Sw. IV-32 on 9 Jul 1886 and recorded "vF, vS, cE, 2 st nr."  There is nothing near his position.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6138 = St II-2 around September 1872.  His published position is roughly 25' west of NGC 6145 (within Abell 2197) and there are only faint stars near this position.  But Stephan made an error with his offset star and once corrected, his position matches NGC 6363 (found again by Stephan on 24 July 1879 and assumed to be a new discovery).  The error was caught and mentioned by Emmanuel Esmiol in the introduction to his 1916 reduction of Stephan's positions with a note that NGC 6138 is identical to NGC 6363.  Esmiol, though, made a typo and called NGC 6138 = NGC 6263.  So, NGC 6138 = NGC 6363.  Despite the earlier discovery of NGC 6138, this galaxy is known as NGC 6363 due to its unambiguous identification.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this globular appeared moderately bright and well concentrated to a bright 1' core.  The halo spanned ~3.5' and the overall structure was symmetric.  A number of very faint stars winked in and out of view with the seeing and the cluster appeared on the verge of extensive resolution at 171x.  I didn't examine it, though, at higher power.


8" (6/27/81): faint, small, even concentration to core.  Although easily visible, there was no resolution.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6139 = D 536 on 13 May 1826 and recorded "a round nebula, about 1' diameter, bright immediately at the centre, and very faint from the bright nucleus to the margin. Another observation makes the figure rather elliptical, with a bright nucleus."  He observed the cluster twice and his position is pretty poor -- 23' east of center.


John Herschel acknowledged Dunlop's discovery despite the poor position and observed the globular on 4 nights.  On his first sweep of 24 Jun 1834 he logged "vB, R, pL, pgmbM, 2.5'. Evidently a globular, but moonlight very bright and near full, and I cannot see the individual stars."  Two nights later he wrote "B, R, pgbM, resolvable, 2'."  Another two nights later he wrote "pB, R, pgbM, resolvable, with left eye I can barely discern a few of the stars."  Using the Great Melbourne Telescope on 2 Jun 1877, Joseph Turner called it "very finely stippled but too faint for any stars to be seen distinctly" (p. 137 in logbook).

At 375x, a narrow spiral arm oriented E-W is occasionally visible just south of the bar, and it extends slightly further east than the brighter central region.

NGC 6144 = ESO 517-6 = IC 4606:

16 27 14.0 -26 01 25; Sco

V = 9.1;  Size 9.3';  Surf Br = 1.1


18" (7/26/06): at 325x roughly two dozen stars were resolved over an irregular, scraggly glow. A mag 12 star at the west edge is probably a field star.  Very weak central condensation (concentration class XI) so the appearance does not look like a typical globular.


17.5" (6/6/86): about 20 stars mag 12-14 resolved at 286x.  The brightest mag 12 star is at the west edge.  Located 37' NW of Antares.  This globular is about 30,000 light years away or 5 times the distance of nearby M4.


13.1" (6/18/85): a dozen very faint stars are resolved at 220x over haze.  Includes a string of stars to the SE.


13.1" (6/19/82): just resolves in steady moments into perhaps 15 very faint stars over haze.  Otherwise the globular is very lively and mottled.


8" (6/27/81): faint, small.  A mag 12 star is at the SW end but no other resolution.  Located 40' NW of Antares.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6144 = H VI-10 = h3629 on 22 May 1784 (sweep 223) and recorded "a very close considerably L cluster of the smallest stars imaginable; all the stars are of a dusky red colour.  This cluster is the next step to an easily resolvable nebula."  John Herschel called the globular "pL; oval; gbM; resolved."


David Frew comments "I'm almost sure that IC 4606 (observed by Finlay from the Cape) is just an observation of the globular cluster NGC 6144 with an error in position [4.3 min of time too large]. His description fits perfectly: "follows a faint star 4.5 secs., and is 0.5 [arcmin] S."  There is a 12th magnitude star on the north-preceding side of the core, so this identification seems very plausible.

George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, discovered NGC 6147 on 26 May 1849.  He noted "2 new neb, alpha (on diagram) eF st, Beta small."  The diagram clearly shows NGC 6147 = PGC 58077 (labeled as Alpha) on a line between NGC 6146 (not labeled) and NGC 6145 (labeled Beta), with NGC 6147 slightly closer to NGC 6145.   The direction of drift is not shown but is presumably down in the diagram. Dreyer later added the parenthetical comment "Query h1957 [NGC 6145] and h1958 [NGC 6146] and one Nova."  One faint star (labeled alpha) is shown on the diagram and it appears to correspond with MCG +07-34-022 = PGC 58078.  Since Stoney didn't record it as nebulous, it didn't receive a NGC designation.


MCG and UGC (notes section) does not label PGC 58077 as NGC 6147.  The RNGC misidentifies PGC 58078 as NGC 6147 and mislabels NGC 6147 as NGC 6141.

Albert Marth discovered NGC 6148 = m 310 on 10 Jun 1864 and noted "vF, S, with **."  There is nothing at his position.  RNGC identifies PGC 58162 as NGC 6148.  This faint galaxy is 33 seconds of time east and 4.3' south of Marth's position, an unusually poor match, and in RNGC Corrections #4, I listed the RNGC identification as questionable.  But PGC 58162 is surrounded by a small group of a half-dozen stars and may match Marth's comment "with **".

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this striking bi-polar nebula was quite impressive at 200x and UHC filter.  The two bright loops or arcs are symmetrically placed along the rim, 2.6' NW and 3' SE of center with the southeastern arc brighter.  The interior of the rim is filled with a fainter glow and the entire object forms a slightly elongated, 6.2'x5.2' oval.  The nebula is dominated by the mag 6.8 central star (HD 148937).  Mag 9 HD 148988 lies 3' NE of center.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bipolar emission nebula was a startling sight at 171x and UHC filter!  A bright illuminating star (HD 148937 at V = 6.8) is surrounded by two lobes or loops to the NW (NGC 6164) and SE (NGC 6165).  Both loops contain brighter arcs symmetrically placed at the opposite ends.  This is a large object, ~6' diameter, with the southeastern knot a bit brighter.  A mag 9 star is 3' NE, outside the nebulosity.  Located near the midpoint of mag 4.5 Epsilon Normae 1.3° NW and NGC 6188/6193 a similar distance SE.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6164 = h3633 on 1 Jul 1834, along with NGC 6165, and recorded "Neb violently suspected immediately preceding a double star."  His rough position (marked as approximate in RA and Dec (nearest arcmin)) is less than 2' south of the northwest wing of this large emission shell.  NGC 6165 refers to the southeast wing.


Several older sources, including the RNGC, misclassify this object as a planetary nebula.  The illuminating star is a massive, evolved O-star, losing mass from its outer layers through a strong stellar wind  (similar mechanism to the Crescent Nebula = NGC 6188 and Thor's Helmet = NGC 2359).

The brightest mag 7.4 star (HD 14919) is on the west edge of the cluster and the richest region is just following this star.  At the east edge of this rich group is a nice double star. Several curving strings and sprays of stars crisscross the cluster.  NGC 6164/6165 lies 1.7° north.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 6167 = D 400 = h3635 on 26 Jun 1826 with his 9-inch reflector from Parramatta, New South Wales.  He recorded "a pretty large faint nebula, about 6' diameter, easily resolvable, round figure, with two rows of small stars following."  His position is 13' northeast of center of the cluster.  Apparently D 401 is a duplicate observation: "A very faint cluster of small stars, with a branch extended; the head of the cluster is rich in small stars."  His position for D 401 is 16.5' east-southeast of the cluster and he notes 3 observations.  JH recorded "a large irregular cluster of loose stars 11..14th magnitude which fills field; place that of an 8th magnitude star in the preceding part."

17.5": very faint, fairly small, very elongated WNW-ESE.  A mag 14.5 star is attached at the east end 39" from center.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6168 = Sw. I-46 on 21 May 1884 and recorded "eeF; vE; F * at p[receding] end; v diff." There is nothing at his position, and CGCG 109-025, 4' north-northwest of Swift's position, is small and round.  When Howe observed the field in 1899-00, he remarked "The "F * at p end" I did not see."  His position, though, matches CGCG 109-025.


A more likely candidate, though, is UGC 10434, which is 80 seconds of RA east of Swift's position.  This galaxy fits the comment "vE" and has a star at its end, but on the following side.  Neither UGC (10434), MCG (+03-42-016) or CGCG (109-028) label this galaxy as NGC 6168, though it is taken as NGC 6168 in the RNGC.

18" (4/5/16 - Coonabarabran, 139x and 236x): at low power a number of scattered stars surround mag 4.9 Mu Normae, but these are not eye-catching or cluster-like as the star density is high in this area, especially to the north and west.  At 236x, a number of very faint stars surround Mu itself, particularly in a wreath-like shape on the north side and a east-west trending chain of mag 12-13.5 stars about 5' south.  A nice triangle of mag 12 stars (sides ~1') lies 4' S of Mu.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6169 = h3636 on 1 Jun 1834 and recorded "Cluster; place of a * Mu Normae in it."


The 1973 study by Vogt and Moffat "Southern Open Star Clusters III." (1973A&AS...10..135M) states "According to the Catalogue of Star Clusters and Associations this cluster has a diameter of 7' and is centered on the bright super-giant mu Nor. However, there is no obvious clustering here. To check this, three stars close to mu Nor were observed which show no genetic relation to one another or to mu Nor."  A 2011 study ("A Catalog of 120 NGC Open Star Clusters") also found no CMD could be determined, so this group is an asterism.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6170 = Sw. IV-35 on 9 Jul 1886 and recorded "eeF; vS; R; in vacancy; many pB stars south; e diff."  His position is 39 seconds of RA west of CGCG 298-038 = PGC 58188 and his description is a perfect match.  Swift found this galaxy again less than 3 months later and published it in list V-70 = NGC 6176, with a very similar description.


Jack Sulentic, in the RNGC, equated NGC 6170 = NGC 6176 and Harold Corwin concurs.  By prior discovery, this galaxy should be identified as NGC 6170, but it is known as NGC 6176 because of the accurate position.

In the halo, roughly 35-40 stars were resolved and in addition the bright 1.5' core was partially resolved into a large number of densely packed stars.  The cluster extends roughly to 6'x4.5', reaching the bright stars off the east and west side and elongated E-W at least 4:3.


17.5" (7/10/99): this bright globular was well resolved at 220x, with a ~5'x3' halo elongated in an E-W orientation although the sharply defined core is circular and ~2' in diameter.  Enclosing the globular on the west, east and south sides are brighter mag 11.5-12.5 stars.  Roughly 30 stars are scattered throughout the outer halo at 280x and a couple of dozen densely packed stars overlay the core of the globular in steady moments.

Pierre Méchain discovered M107 = NGC 6171 = H VI-40 = h3637 in April 1782.  It was discovered after Messier's final catalogue was sent to publication but was included in a letter dated 6 May 1783 to Johann Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch and published in the 1786 Jarbuch volume.  Mechain wrote "In April 1782 I discovered a small nebula in the left flank of Ophiuchus between the stars Zeta and Phi, the position of which I have not yet observed any closer."  This was the last of Mechain's discoveries.


William Herschel rediscovered the globular on 12 May 1793 (sweep 1043) and called it "a very beautiful extremely compressed cluster of stars, extremely rich, R, about 5 or 6' dia, gradually more compressed toward the center."  It was found again by Karl Harding around 1823 and reported as new.  John Herschel, observing from the Cape of Good Hope on 5 Jun 1836, recorded "Globular; v rich; gpmbM; diam in RA = 20.0s; that of the most compressed part 4.5s; stars well separated."

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6172 = St XIII-86 on 21 Jun 1884.  Due to a misprint in Stephan's list XIII, the RA is 10 tmin too large.  The position for his comparison star (SAO 141069) is 16 16 19.5 -01 38 55 (2000) and once this correction is applied the recomputed coordinates for NGC 6172 matches UGC 10352.  The error was caught and corrected by Esmiol in his 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's position.  Esmiol dropped NGC 6172 from the list and added an anonymous nebula at the position of UGC 10352.


Lewis Swift found this galaxy on 19 Apr 1890, and reported Sw. IX-61 (later IC 1213) as "F; vS; R."  His RA is 9 seconds too small.  So, NGC 6172 = IC 1213 with priority to Stephan's observation.  Because of the erroneous position for NGC 6172, the RNGC misclassifies NGC 6172 as nonexistent and UGC 10352 is labeled as IC 1213, instead of NGC 7172, in UGC, MCG and CGCG. RC3 has the correct identification.

CGCG 224-047 = PGC 58334 lies 4.5' W.  This galaxy was also discovered and sketched in the Birr Castle observation and Harold Corwin favors it as NGC 6174.  CGCG 224-047 appeared faint, small, round, 25" diameter, even surface brightness.  MCG +07-34-081 = PGC 58321 lies 2.5' further southwest and appeared faint, small, round, 20" diameter, low even surface brightness.


17.5" (7/5/86): very faint, small, slightly elongated, requires averted vision.  Located 3.5' N of NGC 6173 in AGC 2197.  This is a double system (unresolved).


George Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's observing assistant, discovered two new nebulae in the field of NGC 6173, on 26 May 1849.  The 1861 LdR publication mentions "another near" in the entry for NGC 6160, 6173 and 6175.  But the 1880 LdR monograph includes a diagram and states, "3 new neb as in diagram, double star suspected in Alpha, Beta faint, Gamma pL & eeF."  The three nebulae shown in the diagram are not labeled, but assuming the arrowed direction is west, the configuration fits NGC 6173 (Gamma), the double system IV Zw 63 = PGC 58350 + 58351 (Alpha, shown with two nuclei on the sketch!) to the north, and CGCG 224-047 = PGC 58334 (Beta) due west of the double system.  The separations indicated on the sketch are too large -- IV Zw 63 is marked 6' north (actual separation is just under 4') and CGCG 224-047 is marked 8' to its west (actual separation is 4.5').  Two years later (30 May 1851) Bindon Stoney confirmed "Alpha is a double neb, Gamma is vF."  Dreyer added the comment "diagram agreeing with the one made in 1849."


John Herschel only included a single LdR nova in the GC based on the note in 1861 publication.  In the NGC, Dreyer added a note to NGC 6174, "Second of 3, forming a rectangular triangle, the 2 others being assumed to be h1962 [NGC 6173] and h1963 [NGC 6175], but the identity of the group is doubtful."  RNGC and PGC identify the double system IV Zw 63 = PGC 58350 + 58351 as NGC 6174 (as here).  Harold Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke favor CGCG 224-047 = PGC 58334, as Dreyer didn't mention NGC 6174 was double.  Both assignments, though, are reasonable.  See Corwin's notes for more.

Swift discovered CGCG 298-038 just 3 months earlier and published it in list IV-35 = NGC 6170.  His earlier position, though, was 39 seconds too far west and apparently he didn't catch the equivalence.  So, NGC 6176 = NGC 6170.

Size 20'x12'


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): With the 27mm Panoptic at 76x and UHC filter, this is an amazing region of bright and dark nebulosity involving open cluster NGC 6193 and extending throughout the entire 51' field in a N-S orientation. The bright nebulosity is split into two large sections by a dark lane that runs N-S.  The eastern portion is the most prominent and includes the scattered cluster NGC 6193 and its three brighter stars (5.6/6.8/7).  On the southern end of this section the nebulosity tapers down towards the SW corner, 15' to 20' from the core of the cluster.  The western rim of the nebula is sharply defined with a locally brighter, crisp edge delineated by the dark river that meanders N-S throughout the field.  The eastern and northern ends fade into the rich Milky Way background field.


A nearly perfect ellipse of moderately bright stars is just SW of the main body of the cluster and beyond the edge of nebulosity into the rift.  The center of this ring is within the highest contrast portion of the dark rift, although the eastern side of the ring intersects the bright edge.  This 15'x10' loop of stars spans the two sections of nebulosity.


The western portion of the nebulosity extends mostly NW of the elliptical ring and is clearly fainter.  The highest contrast is along its eastern rim and runs N-S, roughly parallel to its brighter counterpart on the east side of the rift.  The nebulosity fades towards the north and west with no well-defined edge but again is quite extensive.  The catalogued dimensions of 20'x12' are too small and covers only the brightest portion of this much more extension HII/dark nebula complex.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very large faint nebulosity which envelops open cluster NGC 6193, about 20' diameter.  Extends roughly E-W through the cluster but also a very long brighter streak oriented N-S extends mainly to the south on the west side of cluster.  This streak is well defined with an abrupt edge but there is no contrast gain with a UHC filter.


8" (7/16/82): faint, moderately large, low surface brightness glow on the west side of open cluster NGC 6193.  This object is very low on the horizon from Northern California (less than 3 degrees max elevation).


John Herschel discovered NGC 6188 = h3640 on 15 Apr 1836 and recorded "The brightest part of a vL, faint, diffused, branching nebula, which involves in it nf part the star Brisbane 5789, and extends into the cluster D 413 [NGC 6193], which it in part surrounds. No doubt about the nebula, which in the brightest part of it precedes the cluster about 1 min of time. The following stars behind the double star, and quite free of nebula. I presume the neb and cluster to be unconnected."  His rough position (nearest minute of RA and nearest minute of dec) was poor; it lands to the southwest of the nebulosity, about 22' SW of NGC 6193, although he states the "brightest part of precedes the cluster about 1 min of time."


Despite many attempts, Joseph Turner (on 2 Jun 1877 and 16 Oct 1878)  and Robert Ellery were unable to find this nebula with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  This might be due to Herschel's poor position or the GMT's field of view was too small at the lowest power of 234x with a 14' field.

It's possible that Swift found this galaxy again on 6 Jul 1886 and recorded it in discovery list IV-36 = NGC 6191, but with a 50' error in declination.  Swift mentioned two stars preceding, but the "v coarse double star nr" is following, so this equivalence is not certain.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6191 = Sw. IV-36 on 6 Jul 1886 and recorded "pF; pL; E; 2 stars near preceding." There is nothing near his position.  If Swift made a 50' error in declination, then NGC 6191 is a second discovery of NGC 6189, though the two stars near this galaxy are east, not west.  Swift discovered this galaxy on 3 Aug 1885 and catalogued it in his second discovery list (#41).  As expected, Bigourdan was unable to find NGC 6191 at Swift's position.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  So, possibly NGC 6191 = NGC 6189, with much uncertainty.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for additional candidates.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 117x, ~75 stars were visible in a 15' field surrounding the ionizing source HJ 4876, a bright 10" double consisting of mag 5.6 O3-type HD 150136 and mag 6.8 O6-type HD 150135.  I also saw a couple of very faint mag 15 companions to the bright double.  In addition, a 7th mag star (HD 150041) is on the west side of the cluster.  These three bright stars are encased in nebulous halos that respond to a UHC filter (indicating emission).  The cluster itself is scattered with no central concentration and includes a mixture of mostly bright and some very faint stars.  A perfect ellipse of moderately bright stars is just southwest of the main portion of the cluster.  Interestingly, the center of this ring is mostly free of the nebulosity (RCW 108) that permeates the field (see NGC 6188 for description) .  The RCW 108 complex is in the Ara OB1 association, one of the youngest and closest star-forming regions.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): 45 stars in a 15' diameter at 63x.  Includes a bright mag 5.6/6.8 double star  at 10" separation and mag 7 SAO 227038 6' W.  A circular group of seven fairly bright stars is just east of the double star with a fainter curved string of stars in the center.  There are several brighter stragglers on the east side.  The cluster is generally spread out with no rich regions.  Extensive nebulosity is involved (see NGC 6188).


8" (7/17/82): three bright stars including h4876 (6.0/7.0 at 10").  Many faint stars are visible with averted vision.  Includes emission/reflection nebula NGC 6188.  This star-forming region is extremely far south for viewing from the Sierra foothills (only 2.5° above the horizon)!


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6193 = D 413 = h3640 with his 9-inch f/12 reflector from Parramatta, New South Wales.  He reported "A cluster of small stars, with a bright star in the preceding side. A very considerable branch or tail proceeds from the north side, which joins a very large cluster."  He did not mention any nebulosity.


On 15 Apr 1836, John Herschel described a "cluster VIII; consists of about a dozen stars 10..11m, and perhaps as many less, with stragglers, which fill field. In its preceding part is a fine double star [HJ 4876] and yet more preceding is a vL, faint nebula [NGC 6188], in which the preceding part of the cl is involved."

V = 7.4;  Size 12'


22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): at 110x this large, rich open cluster resolves into roughly 200 stars, extending over one-half the 22mm Panoptic field (~20'x15').  A very close triple star is near the center (one component fainter) and a wider pair lies 3.5' NE.


11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): at 80x perhaps 150 stars were visible in a roughly 20' cluster (the catalogued dimension of 12' appears significantly too small).  Includes roughly 30 brighter mag 9.5-11.5 stars over a rich background of mag 12-14 stars.  No distinct boundary to the cluster.  A mag 7 star is off the SE side.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): about 75 stars in a 20' diameter at 63x.  Bright, large, rich, many stars mag 9-11 over a carpet of faint stars.  Mag 7.1 SAO 227144 is off the SE edge 13' from the center of the cluster.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6200 = h3643 on 1 Jul 1834 and recorded "a great space full of milky way stars, so thickly sown as to merit being called a cluster."  His position and description matches this large cluster.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6202 = Sw. IV-38 on 9 Jul 1886 and recorded "eeF, pS, * nr following".  There are no candidates near his position and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (not found by Sulentic).


Harold Corwin suggests NGC 6202 may be a duplicate of NGC 6226 as this galaxy has a mag 11.5 star 2' east and the declination is within a couple of arc minutes. But this implies his RA was 7 minutes too small, perhaps a typo or copyilng error.  I've left this number as lost.

V = 8.2;  Size 2.3'


22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): ~100 stars mag 10-14 in an 8' group.  A number of the stars are arranged in interesting chains and loops.  A north-south star chain on the east side leads to a knot of bright stars including mag 7.5 HD 150958 and a mag 8.5 star.  This detached group is catalogued as Hogg 22 and it may be a separate cluster.  Another long curving string of stars (extended N-S) is located in the NE edge of the cluster.  But the richest clustering is a 3' circular group including a nice trio of mag 13 stars with separations of ~10".


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this is a bright cluster with roughly 80 stars in a 7' circle.  Near the center is knot of four stars with additional very faint stars huddled around at 228x.  Many of the stars in the cluster are arranged in a few loops and chains.  Most of the brighter stars in the cluster are situated around the edges including a line of four stars at the east edge.  Four bright stars are off the SE side including mag 7.3 SAO 227189 (catalogued as Hogg 22).


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): about 40 stars in 8' diameter at 63x.  Rich appearance over an unresolved haze.  A close triple star is in the center with four bright mag 8-9 stars in a tight group off the SE edge (this is a separate cluster Hogg 22).


8" (7/16/82): only a few faint stars are visible over unresolved haze but appears to be rich.  This is one of the southernmost clusters I've viewed from Northern California latitude.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6204 = D 442 = h3644 on 13 May 1826 and recorded "seven or eight small stars in a group, about 1' diameter, with a minute line of stars on the north side."  His position is 15' too far northeast, typical of his rough positions.


John Herschel first recorded NGC 6204 on 1 Jul 1834 as a "cluster moderately compressed class VIII; stars 11.12th mag; S.f. is a brilliant knot of stars, one of which is 8th mag, and the others 9th magnitude."  On a later sweep he noted a "singular shaped cluster, irregularly round, compressed VII class, set as it were in a nearly rectangular frame of stars detached from cluster."  He included a sketch of the unusual star chains in Plate V, figure 6 and the "brilliant knot of stars" south following is Hogg 22.

V = 5.8;  Size 16.6';  Surf Br = 0.1


17.5" (7/9/94): several hundred stars in a 10'-12' diameter with a bright central core of 6' diameter.  Many stars are arranged in strings and loops including a distinctive streamer attached on the SE side which heads south and curves west forming a semicircle and another string is attached on the west side of the core and precedes the cluster.  Several chains of stars are also resolved over the 6' core.  Running along the north edge of the core is a starless strip or a long dark lane which separates the central region from the northern outer halo members.  A dark "lane" protrudes into the core on the SE side - this is one of three dark lanes that converge forming a "Y" and referred to as the "Propeller" (first described by Lord Rosse).  NGC 6207 lies 28' NE and extremely faint IC 4617 lies 14' NNE.  HD 150998, a mag 6.8 orange K2 star, lies 17' ENE of center.


8": very bright, very large, round, highly resolved into several hundred stars mag 11.5-13.5 over the entire disc.  Includes several star chains and streamers.


Naked-eye: fairly easy object in a dark sky, appearing as a dim bloated star.


Edmond Halley discovered M13 = NGC 6205 = h1968 in 1714 with a 24-foot (focal length) refractor.  He noted "This is but a little Patch, but it shews itself to the naked eye, when the sky is serene and the Moon absent."  Charles Messier independently found the cluster on 1 Jun 1764 and reported (first Messier catalogue), "I have discovered a nebula in the girdle of Hercules, of which I am sure it doesn't contain any star; having examined it with a Newtonian telescope of four feet and a half [FL], which magnified 60 times, it is round, beautiful & brilliant, the center brighter than the borders.."


M13 was probably the second deep-sky object that William Herschel observed (after the Orion Nebula) before starting his sweeps.  Using a 6-inch (7-ft focal length) on 22 Aug 1779 he noted M13 was "without stars".  On 16 May 1787 (sweep 739 with his 18.7-inch) he recorded, "a most beautiful cluster of stars, exceedingly compressed in the middle and very rich, the scattered stars which belong to it extend to 8 or 9' diam.  The most compressed part about 2' or 2 1/2'; the later is R.  The former more irregular."


William Parsons (LdR), in his 1850 monograph, noted "an unquestionable curvilinear sweep in the disposition of the exterior stars."  Bond later "confirmed" this spiral structure (seems a case of imagining spiral arrangements in deep sky objects, which was common at the time) in 1860.  Bindon Stoney sketch on 26 May 1851 (includied in the 1861 publication) clearly showed three dark "lanes"in a "Y" configuration.  The dark lanes, sometimes referred to as the "propeller" nowadays, were mentioned in numerous observations with the 72".  Mark Harrington, director of the Detroit Observatory in Ann Arbor, made a study of the dark rifts for a month in 1887 with the 6" and 12.5" refractors.  Comparing Stoney's sketch with his observations and a drawing made with the aid of H.C. Markham, Harrington mistakenly concluded the rifts "have shifted their position slightly" since Stoney's drawing.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6206 = Sw. V-71 on 23 Oct 1886 and recorded "pF; eS; R; stellar; 3 vF stars near north point to it."  His position is 22 seconds west of UGC 10506, and his comment about the 3 stars clinches this identification.  Guillaume Bigourdan found the galaxy on 13 Aug 1888 while searching for NGC 6206 at Swift's position and reported it as new (Big. 210).  Dreyer recatalogued the galaxy as IC 1227, though Bigourdan later realized his object was equivalent to NGC 6206 (corrected in Comptes Rendus, 1 Jul 1901).  Dreyer repeated that NGC 6206 = IC 2227 in the IC 2 Notes. See Corwin's notes on IC 2227 for the full story.

Includes a mag 10 star on the south side, though the majority are 12-13th magnitude.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6208 = D 364 = h3646 on 28 Jul 1826 and recorded "A round, faint nebula, about 1' diameter, with three small stars in it; a bright star south of the nebula."  His position is 8' south-southwest of the center of the cluster.  On 8 Jul 1834 from the CGH, JH logged "A pretty insulated milky way cluster, class VII of large stars; 8' diameter; stars 9...12th magnitude."  On a second sweep he called it a "cluster class VII; rich; not much compressed in the middle; more than fills field; stars 11...14th mag but chiefly small."

V = 8.8;  Size 20"x13"


48" (5/5/16): at 488x; extremely bright, high surface brightness planetary, oval 5:4 WSW-ENE, somewhat rectangular main body.  The central star was continuously visible and situated slightly east of center.  A small darker region surrounds the central star.  On close inspection the main body has an irregular outline, is slightly brighter along the north side and bulges out on the southwest end.  A thin fainter "strip" or shell with a much lower surface brightness and a pinkish color encases the main body.  Two or three broad "jets" or wings (broadest at the base) extend out of the halo on the north and south ends (images show the central part is NNW and SSE) with the northern wing more obvious.  A third wing was sometimes visible on the west side.


24" (6/12/15): at 375x and 500x; slightly elongated oval disc E-W or WSW-ENE.  The very high surface brightness central region is encased in a small, but obvious lower surface brightness shell.  Extremely faint "wings" appear to extend to the north and south, though the northern extension is more definite.  These are roughly in the direction of the minor axis.


28" (7/8/13): viewed at 375x with an "inverse OIII" or central star filter, which dramatically dimmed this extremely high surface brightness green planetary.  Without the filter the central star was not seen at this magnification (the planetary had a strong green color), but with the filter the central star was easily visible!


18" (7/20/06): appears as a beautiful light blue cosmic egg at 225x with an extremely high surface brightness.  Appears slightly elongated ~E-W, ~25"x20" with a very faint thin outer envelope.  At 325x and 435x the faint outer halo is obvious, increasing the size ~35"x28" with the elongation possibly WSW-ENE.  Viewed in fairly poor seeing on 7/20 but on 7/22 in good seeing I was able to use as much as 807x.  With these better conditions the surface brightness was irregular and the faint outer shell fairly prominent.  The bright inner disc was oval but not symmetric.


17.5" (5/27/00): beautiful bluish oval at 220x, elongated 4:3 E-W, roughly 24"x18".  At 380x, there appears to be a very small fainter halo.  At 500x, the narrow outer envelope is more evident and is elongated in the direction of the major axis, increasing the size to ~30"x20".


17.5" (7/4/86): very bright, small blue oval 20"x15" with an unusually high surface brightness.  At 572x, a fainter outer envelope is suspected.  An evenly matched close double star ∑2094 = 7.4/7.7 at 1.3" lies 17' SSW.


13.1" (7/5/83): very bright, extremely high surface brightness, blue, takes very high power.  The mag 12.6 central star was not seen.


Wilhelm Struve discovered NGC 6210 = ∑ 5 = h1970 in 1825 while searching for double stars with the 9.6" Fraunhofer refractor at the Dorpat Observatory in Estonia.  It was included as #5 in a list of 9 "Nebulae dectae" in an appendix to his main catalogue of double stars published in 1827.  He described a "bright planetary nebula, diameter 6", like a star of mag 7".  The planetary was earlier catalogued as a star in Lalande's catalogue of 1801 (LL 30510).


John Herschel observed the nebula on 25 May 1830 and recorded, "Struve's fifth nebula, very bright, equal to a star of 8 to 9m, 6" diameter and of uniform light, but with the edges boiling and ragged.  A fine object like a star out of focus".  Vogel observed and sketched the central star with the 27" Grubb refractor at the Vienna observatory on 4 Jun 1883.  He noted a "Bright planetary nebula of elliptical shape.  A delicate star is in the nebula, nearly at the centre.  The nebula is surrounded by a faint elliptical shell."


On 5 May 1850, Johnstone Stoney, Lord Rosse's assistant, recorded, "intense blue centre fading off to some distance all around.  Small star nf to which neb nearly extends.  Fancied a projection from the bright centre towards np, but I think it was only fancy."  It is possible, though, that Rosse detected the wing or extension to the northwest!  James Keeler clearly sketched the wings using the Lick 36-inch refractor.


Sherburne Burnham observed the planetary in 1891 while at Lick Observatory, but did not notice the central star.  Later at Yerkes (1908) he commented, "At the present time it could not be overlooked with any moderate aperture.  It is nearly 12th magnitude, and appears with favorable atmospheric conditions as a sharp, brilliant point.  Doubtless this has been seen by others.  If it is not variable, I cannount account for my failure to see and measure it with the 36-inch at Mt. Hamilton.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported, "Central star about mag 11, surrounded by bright matter in the form of an oblong 8" in length. Outside of this is an oblong of somewhat fainter matter 20" X 13", from the ends of which extend two fainter ansae in p.a. 97-277°.  From the north and south sides of the central oblong extend two longer ansae in p.a. 167-347°, showing a ring formation, making the nebula 43" long in this direction."


Wolfgang Steinicke explained why William Herschel missed NGC 6210 in his sweeps: "On 15 May 1784 he swept the region (sweep 217).  However he stopped for about 30 minutes for star counts, i.e. the sky passed horizontally through the eyepiece. Unfortunately the strip runs about 1° below the nebula, starting 25 tmin west and ending 6 tmin east of it.  Thus the object could not enter his field of view (15').  On 10 April 1785 he inspected the field again (sweep 395), but saw only some Flamsteed stars in the morning twilight."

48" (10/22/11): at 375x, this beautiful, two-armed barred spiral spans ~2.3'x1.5' NNW-SSE.  A bright central bar is well-defined, mottled and sharply concentrated with an intensely bright, very small nucleus.  A mag 15 star is superimposed just SE of the nucleus.  The bar contains a brighter, mottled patch at the NNW end.  A long spiral arm is attached at this patch and wraps counterclockwise around the north and northwest side.  A thinner second arm on the SSE side wraps around the south side towards the west.


18" (9/3/08): this fascinating barred spiral displays subtle spiral structure.  At 280x, the main portion appears to be a large central bar, 1.5'x1.0', oriented NNW-SSE.  The bar is punctuated by an unusually bright stellar nucleus.  An extremely faint star is close SSE along the central bar.  Off the north end of the bar is a faint appendage or arm that gently curves to the SE and increases the overall dimensions to 2'x1.5' .  Off the SSE end of the bar, some very weak haze extends to the southwest (beginning of an arm).


17.5" (7/22/01): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~2.5'x1.5', small bright core.  Contains a bright stellar nucleus.  A very faint star is just off the NW edge.  At the NW end a faint spiral arm is attached to the main body, winding north and then trailing back nearly halfway along the NE flank (this increases the dimensions to ~2.5'x2.0').  With concentration a dark gap is visible between the arm and the main body (bar) of the galaxy.  A very short extension is strongly suggested at the SE end, bending towards the west.  All of these features were sketched and later verified on the DSS.


17.5" (5/14/88): bright, fairly large, bright stellar nucleus, elongated.  Irregular appearance; either darker or an indentation on one side (this is probably a gap between the spiral arms).


13" (8/24/84): fairly bright, slightly elongated, stellar nucleus, fairly diffuse outer halo.


8" (8/24/84): faint, fairly small, slightly elongated.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6217 = H I-280 on 12 Dec 1797 (sweep 1071) and logged "cB, cL, E, lbM.  The extent points almost to 2 np pB stars, or rather a little on the following side of them.  This is one of the later galaxies he discovered while searching in the far north to finish up his third catalogue. Hermann Kobold measured a very accurate micrometric position in 1892 with the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg Observatory

V = 6.8;  Size 14.5';  Surf Br = 0.6


18" (7/11/07): at 325x this globular nearly fills the field and extends roughly 11' in diameter.  Contains a very bright 3.5'x2.5' oval core, extended WNW-ESE.  A mag 10 star with an orange tint is just south of the core, 2' from the center.  Two other mag 10-11 stars lie 4' N and 5' ENE of center in the halo.  The core is plastered with an immense number of mag 12.5-13.5 stars and in the central 2' is an incredibly dense mat of mag 13.5 and fainter stars. Very irregular sprays of stars emanate from the central region and form part of the very scraggly outer halo.


17.5" (7/15/99): at 220x this bright cluster is highly resolved over the entire disc.  Appears smaller than M10, perhaps 11'-12' diameter with a fairly well-defined 3.5' core.  Two bright field stars are embedded in the north edge of the halo and a third bright star is off the following end.  A mag 10 star is also superimposed just off the SE edge of the core.  A number of brighter resolved mag 12 stars appear to be grouped into pairs and trios.  There are a couple of hundred fainter stars in the central 8' over unresolved haze.  The outline is very irregular and there are distinctive star-poor areas in the outer halo.


13.1" (6/19/82) : bright, large, round, very intense core with faint stars scattered over the core.  The outer halo is highly resolved into scores of stars.  Slightly inferior to M10 in faint stars.


8" (6/19/82): the outer halo is well resolved and partial resolution of the core.  There are two or three brighter stars in the outer halo.


Charles Messier discovered M12 = NGC 6218 = h1971 on 30 May 1764.  Johann Bode independently found M12, along with M10, on 14 Aug 1774.  William Herschel first observed the globular on 21 May 1783, along with several other clusters, using his 8-inch (10-ft focal length) reflector and noted a "cluster of close stars of different sizes."  Using his 18.7-inch (20-ft focal length) on 3 May 1786 (sweep 562), he recorded "a beautiful cluster of very compressed and vS stars; they are however of various magnitudes.  The most compressed part takes up about 2'; the whole not less than 7 or 8'.  Very gradually most compressed in the middle."


On 15 Apr 1828 (sweep 146), John Herschel called M12 a "v rich globular cluster.  The stars 10...16m; vgmbM, but has stragglers in lines and branches extending some distance from the condensed part, which is 3' diam.  Comes almost to a blaze in the middle, and has a * 10-11m in the centre."  His first observation was on 30 May 1821, while just learning how to sweep.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, fairly large, slightly elongated N-S, ~2.5'x2.0', broad concentration to a small brighter core.  I was surprised there was a strong impression of a spiral arm along the west side of the halo extending to the north.  A very small knot was seen at the northern end, probably within this spiral arm.  Brightest in a group with NGC 6215 19' NW.  Located 25' SE of mag 3.8 Eta Arae in a rich Milky Way field.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6221 = h3649 on 3 May 1835 and recorded "pF; L; R; glbM; 80"."  On a second sweep (5 Jul 1836), he logged it as a "Globular cluster; pB; pL; R; gbM; 2 1/2' dia; barely resolvable."

John Herschel found NGC 6222 = h3650 on 3 Jun 1834 and recorded "a vL, v rich cl; not brilliant; not materially comp M; full 20' diameter; stars 12..13m."  There is nothing at his position, but Harold Corwin checked the sweep record and found that JH made a transcription error of 10 minutes in RA.  Once this correction is made, his position lands on the southeast of side of open cluster NGC 6259.  Interestingly, he first observed this cluster just two nights previously and placed h3660 = D 456 (later NGC 6259) accurately.  So, NGC 6222 = NGC 6259 and not equal to NGC 6216 as previously assumed.

NGC 6227 = ESO 332-005

16 51 33.7 -41 13 50; Sco


18" (6/12/10): this description assumes NGC 6227 refers to the beautifully rich fields to the east and northeast of mag 5.2 HD 151804 (at 16 51 37.7 -41 13 50), extending over a degree.  At 108x, Tr 24 is a striking, very large, bright scattered grouping that overfills the 56' field with no distinct borders.  A number of the stars appeared to be grouped into long chains with smaller knots and concentrations including vdB-Ha 202 and vdB-Ha 205.  On the northern side is IC 4628 (nicknamed the Prawn Nebula), a very large, irregular HII nebula that shows up best with a UHC filter.  On the south edge of IC 4628 is mag 7.2 HD 152723 and 5' SW is a distinctive 8' string oriented NW-SE.  About 20' S of the mag 7.2 star is a mag 6.2 star (V861 Sco) and to the NW is another 20' string extending WNW.  To the south of this string is another 20' string oriented NW-SE that includes vdBH 202.


vdB-Ha 202, situated 10' NNW of mag 6.1-6.4 V861 Sco, is located in a beautifully rich region on the SW side of Tr 24. Within this string is a 15" pair of mag 10 stars and just south of a mag 9 situated 2' NW of the double is vdB-Ha 202, a faint, very rich dusting of stars that is elongated ~N-S.  The cluster is dense, just 2' in length and only partially resolved.  A group of faint stars spread out E-W off the south end.


vdB-Ha 205, situated 20' NE of vdB-Ha 202, consists of 20 stars mag 7.5 to 13.5 in a distinctive 4' group.  The brightest star is on the NW  side.  The center and south side of the group is devoid of stars.  A smaller clump of stars 7' S of vdB-Ha 205 is catalogued as ESO 332-011.  Another string of stars 7' NE is listed as ESO 332-013.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6227 = h3651 on 5 Jun 1834 and noted "A star 5m in a great cl, or an immensely rich milky way patch."  His position corresponds with mag 5.2 HD 151804 at 16 51 37.7 -41 13 50 (2000).  Although the location is definite, the actual size of an "immense" and "great cl" is uncertain.  This star is 45' NW of NGC 6231 but I would assume Herschel is referring to the very rich fields to the east and northeast (Cr 316) which includes Tr 24 and specifically, the rich region around vdB-Ha 202 and vdB-Ha 205, which are 44' and 60' northeast of HD 151804.


Burnham's Celestial Handbook mentions this object as a "rich milky way field northwest NGC 6231.  Not a true cluster."  The ESO description reads "Part of Milky way only."  RNGC classifies NGC 6227 as a nonexistent cluster.

At 435x a number of very faint stars are clearly visible in the halo (roughly two dozen) and the core is quite mottled with several brightness levels towards the center.  The globular forms a perfect equilateral triangle with two 8th magnitude stars 6' W and 6' SW.  While searching for NGC 6229 I ran into a neat little asterism of 6 stars (Leiter 6) located 27' NNW that I had observed the previously month.


17.5": bright, fairly small, very bright core, faint mottled halo.  Roughly 10 extremely faint mag 15-16 stars are resolved around the edges of the halo at 280x.  Forms an equilateral triangle with two mag 8 stars 6' W and 6' SW.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6229 = H IV-50 on 12 May 1787 (sweep 735) and recorded "vB, R, about 4' dia.  The whole of it is almost equally bright with a faint, resolvable margin."  It was misclassified as a planetary nebula (class IV).  CH's reduced position is 4'-5' too far north.

11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): NGC 6231 is a remarkable naked-eye cluster sits just north of Zeta Scorpii.  At 103x this stunning grup contained a half-dozen stars brighter than 7th magnitude and a dozen of mag 8 or brighter.  This bright subset is set over a rich carpet of 100-150 fainter stars in a roughly 20' field.  Extending to the north following a 1° chain of stars is the sprawling open cluster Tr 24 (60' diameter) that includes IC 4628, a large irregular HII region (see notes below).  NGC 6231 is the core of the young Sco OB1 association.


18" (6/12/10): at 108x Tr 24 is a striking, very large, bright scattered group that overfills the 56' field.  A number of the stars appeared to be grouped into long chains with smaller knots and concentrations including vdBh 202 and vdBH 205.  On the northern side is IC 4628, a very large, irregular HII nebula that shows up best with a UHC filter.  On the south edge of IC 4628 is mag 7.2 HD 152723 and 5' SW is a distinctive 8' string oriented NW-SE.  About 20' S of the mag 7.2 star is a mag 6.2 star (V861 Sco) and to the NW is another 20' string extending WNW.  To the south of this string is another 20' string oriented NW-SE that includes vdBH 202.


IC 4628 is a large, HII region embedded on the northern half of Tr 24.  At 108x and UHC filter IC 4628 stood out as a very large, fairly bright glow within Tr 24.  The main glow was elongated E-W, roughly 30'x12' with mag 7.2 HD 152723 just off the south side.  A number of mag 8-10 stars are embedded along the SW and west end of the nebulosity. A fainter extension begins on the east end and extends NE for ~15', ending in a brighter patch with several stars involved.


11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): at 103x the 40' field to the north of NGC 6231is filled with a huge, scattered grouping with no distinct boundaries.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): over 100 stars mag 8-12.  Bright, very large, scattered.  Divided into two main groups and fills the 40' field.  Emission nebula IC 4628 is involved on the north side (seen from Baja) and a trail of stars extends towards NGC 6231.


8" (6/27/81): bright, large, scattered cluster in two main groups.


17.5" (7/4/86): 100 stars at 84x in the main part including 10 bright stars.  Impressive cluster at low power.


13.1" (7/5/83): five bright stars are in the cluster with a dozen stars in the central portion and 50 stars in a 20' field.  There is a 1° field to the NW and NE consisting of fairly bright stars = NGC 6227 and Tr 24 = H12.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): bright group of stars in center like jewels over rich sprays of stars, excellent low power field.  Located 30' N of Zeta Scorpii.  Partially resolved in 8x50 finder.


8" (6/27/81): impressive cluster at 100x with a bright group of 8 stars in the center.  Partially resolved in the 8x50 finder.


Naked-eye (numerous times): this is an easy naked eye cluster, even from northern California, looking like a comet heading north from Zeta Scorpii.   From further south (southern Baja or southern Hemisphere), it is a very prominent naked-eye cluster.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered NGC 6231 = Lac II-13 = D 499 = h3652 around 1650 from Sicily.  Edmond Halley independently discovered the cluster in 1677 whle cataloging southern stars from the island of St. Helena.  Discovery credit is often given to Nicholas-Louis de Lacaille, who observed it in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted a "close group of seven or eight close faint stars".   James Dunlop described "a cluster of pretty bright stars of mixt small magnitudes, considerably congregated to the centre, about 10' diameter, with a large branch of very small stars extended on the north side; this is 150 Scorpii."  John Herschel wrote, "a fine bright, large cluster; pretty rich; class VII; 10'; stars 10...13 mag.  Place of a double star 5m, the preceding but one of 7 bright stars in the middle."


Ashworth argues in the "Journal for the History of Astronomy" (1981) that Ptolemy listed NGC 6231 in his catalogue as a star (14 Scopii), though did not observe it as nebulous.  It was included as a star or nebula, in every major catalogue and atlas since, but it's position and different labels were so inconsistent that it was not recognized as the same object found by Lacaille in 1752.  For example, it was listed as Bayer's southern Mu, and Sharp's Zeta.  It was depicted as the southern of a pair of stars in Bayer's atlas and the northern in Hevelius' atlas.

24" (8/29/19): unusual observation of NGC 6235 with Jupiter just 8' of the globular and Callisto superimposed on the outer south portion of the halo of the globular!  Using 260x, with Jupiter off the edge of the field and Callisto resolved as an obvious 1.3" disc, the core of NGC 6235 was seen as a small, hazy patch and the halo was occasionally seen as a low surface brightness glow.


18" (7/24/06): at 435x this globular was quite scraggly with a small, irregularly shaped core surrounded by a much fainter low surface brightness halo extending to 3'-3.5' diameter.  At least 15 to 20 stars were resolved with 3 or 4 fairly easy brighter stars but most are very faint, in the mag 15-16 range.  With extended viewing, several extremely faint stars popped in and out of visibility in the halo, increasing the overall total to 25-30 stars, though a lower number were visible simultaneously.


17.5" (6/8/91): fairly bright, small, 3' diameter, mottled.  A few stars are resolved at the edges of the halo including a fairly prominent mag 14 star at the east edge of the halo and another mag 14 star at the west edge of the core.  The remaining resolved stars are mag 15 or fainter.  The core is elongated N-S.  The globular has an irregular scraggly halo due to unresolved star lanes.  Located within a triangle of three mag 12-13 stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6235 = H II-584 = h3653 on 26 May 1786 (sweep 566) and recorded "pB, cL, gbM, easily resolvable.  No doubt that it consists of stars."  His position is accurate.  John Herschel made the single observation "pretty compressed; S; 2'; rather triangular than R; mbM; resolved into stars 14...16m."

There is nothing at his position, just 50 seconds of time due east of NGC 6232 = UGC 10537, which was discovered the same night. Harold Corwin comments that NGC 6237 might refer to a faint star(s), but perhaps Swift was confused and recorded NGC 6232 twice. Interestingly, his position for (nonexistent) NGC 6245 is similar amount off from NGC 6236, suggesting he might have recorded both objects twice.

The north edge has a sharper light cut-off apparently due to a dust lane and is slightly concave near the center.  A small, slightly brighter core is offset from center, just south of the dust lane.  The south edge gently bulges out, so overall the galaxy has a weak "banana" shape.  A small knot (blue HII region on the SDSS) is just distinguishable at the WNW end of the galaxy.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6239 = H III-727 on 12 Apr 1788 (sweep 831) and recorded "cF, S, E in the parallel [E-W]."  His position was reduced exactly 1° too far south of UGC 10577 and copied by JH in the GC.  Stephan found the galaxy again on 27 Jun 1876 and reported it as new in his list VII-10.

48" (4/6/13): NGC 6240, a highly disrupted merger, appeared fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, ~1.2'x0.8', irregular shape!  A prominent, thin extension or spike extends 4:1 or 5:1 to the NNE from the central region.  This wing is sharply defined and narrow.  A short, bright, broader extension juts out to the SSW, in the opposite direction of the NNE wing.  Finally, a faint short wing (~15"x5") extends south from the central region on the east side (on the DSS, this branch curves at the south end).  A mag 13.5 star is 30" E, a mag 15.5-16 star is 0.8' SSE and a 12" pair of mag 13.5/15 stars lies 1.5' S.


24" (7/22/14): the Rumpled Starfish appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, moderately large, irregular but roughly elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, ~60"x40", though it increased in size with averted vision.  The surface brightness is irregular, with a mottled texture.  The brightest portion had an offset nucleus or knot on the east side.  On the northeast side, a faint narrow wing extended to the north.  A very short extension was also glimpsed on the southeast side.  A mag 13.5 star is 0.6' NE and a mag 15.7 star is 50" SSE of center.


24" (8/15/12): this irregular galaxy appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, ~1.0'x0.5', broad concentration with a slightly brighter core.  The shape is unusual as the NNE end is narrow, like an edge-on, while the south-southwest end appears wider. With careful viewing, a very faint extension branches south from the central region, creating a forked appearance with the brighter portion trending SSW.  A mag 13.5 star is 0.6' NE and a mag 15.5 star is 0.8' SE of center.


18" (7/22/03): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 0.8'x0.4', weak concentration, appears slightly brighter along the major axis.  With extended viewing, there is an impression of an irregular shape with a very faint extension off the main bar near the center.


17.5" (6/8/91): fairly faint, small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, even surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is at the NE edge 0.6' from center.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6240 = St II-4 = Big 80 on 26 Jul 1870.  His position is ~6' too far southeast, an unusually large error.  Guillaume Bigourdan independently found this galaxy on 2 Jul 1886 and measured an accurate position.  Dreyer realized the equivalence and added a note in the NGC that "Stephan's comparison star must have been LL 30519.  Adopting this star his observation agrees well with Bigourdan's."


E.E. Barnard rediscovered this galaxy on 7 Jul 1888 and noted (from observing log) "Ran upon a nebula close south-preceding a 10m star.  2 seconds p[receding] the star and 1/4' +/- south."  Assuming Barnard's object was probably new, Dreyer recatalogued it as IC 4625 though added the note "? = 6240"  Barnard's position was 2' too far north, but IC 4625 = NGC 6240.

Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6242 = Lac I-10 = D 520 = h3654 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He simply noted an "elongated faint oval spot." James Dunlop observed the cluster on 13 May 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 reflector and recorded "a cluster or group of small stars, about 4' diameter, with branches extending S.p. and N.f., with considerable compression of the stars towards the centre of the group. This answers to the place of 155 Scorpii, but there is no nebula."  He made 3 observations and his position is 4'-5' west of center of the cluster.


John Herschel first observed the cluster from the CGH on 5 June 1834 and logged "a p rich brilliant cluster of stars 10...12th mag, with one 7-8th mag near middle."  Later in month (28 Jun) he recorded "cluster VI class, B, L, rich, discrete, 12', irregular figure, vlbM, fine object; place of a red star 9th mag, rest 11th mag, white."  The next night he logged it as "a fine large rich cluster, class VII, stars 9..12th mag, fills field, place of a red star 8-9th mag in centre."

James Dunlop *may* have been the first to find this cluster on 31 Jul 1826 with his 9-inch homemade reflector from Parramatta NSW, and described D 455 as "an extremely faint ill-defined nebula, easily resolvable into stars; this is in the milky way."  His position, though is just over 40' WSW of the cluster, so the identification is very uncertain.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 73x, 178x and 230x): fairly small 5' cluster, but quite rich with 60-70 stars mag 12-14.5 resolved at 230x.  Stands out as a bright, partially resolved glow at 73x.  Irregular shape but expands E-W on the south side and tapers on the north side.  Contains no bright stars but a mag 8.9 star is just off the southwest side.  Located 27' NNW of 4th magnitude Epsilon1 Arae.  This well-studied cluster is an old, very metal-rich with an age of ~4 billion years.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6253 = D 374 = h3657 on 14 May 1826 and described "a very faint nebula, of an irregular round figure, about 2' diameter, slightly bright towards the centre, easily resolvable into very minute stars, slightly compressed to the centre; this also precedes Epsilon Arae."  His position was off by ~8' (too far southeast).  JH recorded it on 8 Jul 1834 as "a small triangular cl 2' diameter; stars = 13m."

V = 6.6;  Size 15.1';  Surf Br = 0.9


18" (7/14/07): large, gorgeous GC at 225x, extends ~15' in diameter and fills most of the field.  The cluster is sharply concentrated with an intense 5' core containing a huge number of resolved mag 13-15 stars over an unresolved background glow and beautiful strings of stars in the halo.  At 323x the core is slightly elongated SW-NE, ~5'x4' in size.  Strings of stars crisscross the core with a very small triangle of stars at the geometric center.  At 393x, one of the 3 stars in this central triangle is a very close double. The core is pretty uniformly rich and evenly resolved and does not compress towards the center.


17.5" (7/15/99): beautifully resolved at 220x.  The halo appears to extend to nearly 14' although the star density is very low in the outer edge of the halo.  The inner halo is sharply concentrated with a very bright 5'x4' core which is elongated SW-NE.  The cluster is highly resolved into mag 12/13 stars from edge to edge (too numerous to count) with the stars very densely packed over the core.  A second layer of mag 13/14 stars is superimposed over the core.  The halo contains a number of strings including a long string to the south which curves east and a string to the north which curves west.  Also two parallel linear strings head north or NNE from the core.


13.1" (6/19/82): very bright, fairly large, intense core richly covered with fairly bright stars.  Scores of stars are resolved in the outer halo.


8" (6/19/82): bright lively core highly resolved.  The outer halo is highly resolved with several long, distinct streamers.


Charles Messier discovered M10 = NGC 6254 = h1972 on 29 May 1764.  William Herschel first observed the globular on 21 May 1783 with his 8-inch (10-ft focal length) and noted "With 227 I suspected it to consist of stars; with 460 I can see several of them, but they are too small to be counted." In 1784 and 1791 he observed M10 with his 18.7-inch and noted "A beautiful cluster of extremely compressed stars; it resembles the 53d [M53]; and the most compressed part is about 3 or 4 minutes in diameter."


On 1 Jun 1831 (not registered as a sweep), John Herschel logged, "a superb cluster of very compressed stars, gbM.  The stars are 10...15m, and run up to a blaze in the centre, but I see no nucleus.  Diam about 6'; a noble object."  His first observation was on 30 May 1821, the second night he was learning how to sweep.

At the east end of the galaxy is either a blue dwarf companion (HS 1653+3634) or more likely an intensely active star forming complex.  At 375x a very small, nearly stellar knot was visible just off the east end of the main glow.  The knot had a higher surface brightness than the main galaxy.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6255 = H III-689 = h1973 on 16 May 1787 (sweep 739) and recorded "eF, cL, iE nearly in the parallel."  JH made the single observation "eF; vL; E in parallel; 2' l, 1' br."  On 6 May 1850, LdR (or observing assistant George Stoney) noted "Query is it a double streak with a nucleus or a * at f end."  The "star" at the following end is an HII complex seen in my observation.

17.5": not seen in fairly poor seeing and transparency.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6257 = h1974 on 16 May 1831 (sweep 357) and recorded "a suspicious object.  It is pointed to by a faint double star nf.  Doubtful whether a nebula or a vF double star, with perhaps a third star near (of course ill seen)."  There is nothing at his position.  It was looked for once at Birr Castle, but not found.


RNGC, CGCG and PGC identify CGCG 225-012 as NGC 6257, though this galaxy is 70 seconds of RA east of Herschel's position (and 2' north).  Furthermore there isn't a reasonably bright "F double* nf" as per his description.  Finally it may be too faint for JH to have picked up.  So, the standard identification is very unlikely.  Karl Reinmuth, in the 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel" was probably the first to equate CGCG 225-012 with NGC 6257, though his position was 2.5' too far southwest.  In response to an email I sent, Harold Corwin took a look at the field and was unable to find a good alternate candidate (UGC 10599 doesn't match his description, either).

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this cluster appears as a beautifully rich cloud of stars.  A couple of hundred stars are resolved in an 8' diameter.  Fairly uniform in density and magnitude and roughly circular (similar to NGC 7789).  This very rich cluster would be a showpiece for U.S. observers if further north!  NGC 6249 lies 33' SW.


8" (7/16/82): 12 faint stars mag 11-12.5, over unresolved haze, elongated N-S.  Appears to be rich but observed at a very low altitude which diminished the view.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6259 = D 456 = h3660 on 13 May 1826 and described "a very large patch of strong nebula, about 20' long, and 16' broad, rich in small and extremely minute stars."  His position (only to the nearest minute of time in RA) was 11' too far southeast.  On 1 Jun 1834, JH called it "a superb, vL, v rich cluster, which fills field; R, vglbM, stars 11..12th mag, thickly sown at intervals from each other from 10" to 20"." On a second sweep he described it as "vL, v rich, fills more than a field, has one or two straggling appendages p and s; stars 11 and 12th mag, nearly equal."  JH also found the cluster on 3 Jun 1834 but made a 10 minute transcription error in RA.  As a result, h3650 = NGC 6222 is a duplicate observation.

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x this is a very striking globular set in a fine star field.  The halo is very irregular and elongated due to a flattening along the SE side.  The halo is easily resolved into several dozen faint stars, many in strings and chains.  A long string of stars extends from a mag 10.5 star off the SE side along the east edge of the halo.  The center appears offset due to the flattening and is very compressed with a large, blazing core.


13.1" (6/19/82): very bright nucleus, asymmetric appearance with a flattened SE region.  The outer halo is very mottled and just resolved into many faint stars at 220x.


8" (6/19/82): bright nucleus, nonsymmetrical appearance, fans out to the west from an off-center core.  A few very faint stars are resolved at the west edge.


Charles Messier discovered M62 = NGC 6266 = D 627 = h3661 on 7 June 1771 and described a "very beautiful nebula, discovered in Scorpio, it resembles a little Comet, the centre is brilliant & surrounded by a faint glow."


William Herschel first observed the globular on 28 May 1783 with his 6-inch (10-foot telescope) and noted "With 250 power, a strong suspicion, amounting almost to a certainty, of its consisting of stars.  In observations with his 18.7-inch (20-foot telescope) in 1785 and 1786, he called the cluster "Extremely bright, round, very gradually brighter in the middle, about 4 or 5' in diameter; 240 power with strong attention showed the stars of it. The cluster is a miniature of the 3d of the Connoissance."


On 8 May 1834, John Herschel was the first to note its off-center core: "globular, vB, L, R, pgvmbM, perfectly resolved with left eye, hardly with right. The most condensed part is a perfect blaze, but not quite in the centre. The southern part runs out further. A beautiful object (See figure 13, Plate VI).  [Semi] Diam = 13.5 seconds in RA."


Using the Great Melbourne Telescope on 8 Oct 1874, Joseph Turner called it a "superb object and almost a miniature of Omega Centauri".   He noted "this condensed portion is not quite central, but (offset) toward the north-following side, the cluster branching out considerably in the south-preceding direction."

William Herschel first resolved the cluster using his 6-inch (10-foot focal length) on 28 May 1783, before his sweeps began. "I can count 5 or 6; & all the rest of the light appears mottled like other nebulas when not sufficiently magnified and illuminated to shew the stars."

UGC 10643, which is identified as NGC 6274 in the RNGC, PGC, NED and SIMBAD is located 21' NW.  At 225x and 375x it appeared faint to fairly faint, small, roundish, ~22"x18", small slightly brighter nucleus.  UGC 10643b = MCG +05-40-020 is a very challenging galaxy (B = 16.5) attached on the south end.  At 225x; UGC 10643b was occasionally visible as an extremely faint glow (too brief/faint for shape).  At 375x I could tell it was elongated to the southeast when it popped.


17.5" (7/1/89): faint, very small, slightly elongated N-S, weak concentration.  A mag 15 star is off the southwest edge 19" from the center.  Located 6' SSW of NGC 6282.


UGC 10643, which is identified as NGC 6274 in the RNGC and PGC, is located 21' NW.  It appeared  faint, small, possibly elongated E-W, brighter core.  Located 2' E of an isosceles triangle consisting of three mag 13-14 stars.  The nearest of these stars is a close double.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6274 = m 326 on 28 Jun 1864 and noted "eF, vS."  There is nothing close to his position.


RNGC and PGC identify UGC 10643 as NGC 6274.  UGC 10643 is a double system (with PGC 59381) situated 11' north and 15 seconds of RA west of Marth's position, so it's a pretty poor match.  Karl Reinmuth first gave this identification in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel".


UGC 10654 is a more likely candidate.  It is situated 1.0 minute of time east of Marth's position, so is only off in one direction and a digit error would account for the error.  Edward Fath suggested this identification in his 1914 paper "A Study of Nebulae", based on plates taken with the 60" at Mt. Wilson.  Harold Corwin concurs with my suggestion that NGC 6274 = UGC 10654, particularly as NGC 6274 would be within 6' of NGC 6282, which Marth also discovered the same night.

In the NGC main table, Dreyer mistakenly equates NGC 6277 with m 328 and NGC 6276 with m 327.


RNGC misidentified UGC 10650 as NGC 6276.  In addition, CGCG and RNGC mislabel NGC 6276 as NGC 6277 and MCG and UGC refer to it as NGC 6276 = NGC 6277.

From the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel recorded "globular cluster; B; R; psbM; diam 7.0s; resolved into stars 16m."

John Herschel discovered NGC 6294 = h1978 on 16 Apr 1828 and recorded "F; S; vsbM; is a companion to the globular cluster VI. 12 [NGC 6293, observed just previously in the sweep]." His position (corrected by a small offset for NGC 6293) corresponds with pair of mag 13 stars at 10" separation.  Herbert Howe, was the first to make this identification in 1898, observing with the 20-inch refractor in Denver.  He noted "This follows 6293 closely, and appears to be simply a very faint double star of mag 13 and 13.5, with an angle on 315°, and distance of 8"."

See observing notes for NGC 6298.  Incorrect identification (and RA typo) in the RNGC.


Lewis Swift found NGC 6298 = Sw. II-50 on 1 Aug 1885 and recorded "vF; eS; R; between 2 stars, nf of 2 [with NGC 6297]."  This observation was made just 3 weeks after discovering NGC 6297 = Sw. II-49.  His two positions are nearly identical and there is only 1 galaxy here "between 2 stars", though on the first observation he described this object as "pretty bright".  Swift must have added the comments "sp of 2" and "nf of 2" later, assuming he had observed different nebulae on the two nights.  In any case, NGC 6297 = NGC 6298.  Bigourdan observed this galaxy and corrected the RA  but of course failed to find NGC 6298.


The RNGC misidentifies some "very flat" galaxy as NGC 6298 (possibly 2MASX J17042122+6202573, but the position has an obvious typo (RA listed as 11h) so it is difficult to interpret.  I reported this error in my RNGC Corrections #3 list.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 6300 is a very unusual galaxy at a low galactic latitude with an appearance similar to a fairly large emission nebula in a rich Milky Way star field!  The shape seemed irregular, but elongated 5:3 NW-SE, ~3.0'x1.8' with a weak concentration to a slightly brighter core.  Two brighter stars (mag 12.5) are superimposed on the core and another two mag 13.5 stars are superimposed near the north and south ends of the halo!  These stars confuse the observation of this strange looking galaxy (a dusty barred spiral with ring).  Located 9.5' SW of mag 7.6 HD 155797.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6300 = h3668 on 30 Jun 1826, according to Glen Cozens who examined his handwritten notes (on microfiche).  For some reason, though, Dunlop didn't include this object in his catalogue.


John Herschel rediscovered NGC 6300 = h3668 on 30 Jun 1826 and recorded "F; vL; R; vgvlbM; 3'; has several stars, one = 11m; involved but being on a rich ground, there appears no connection."  Herschel was credited with the discovery in the NGC.

17.5" (8/1/89): faint, moderately large, oval WNW-ESE.  A mag 13 star is embedded in the SW portion.  Forms a pair with CGCG 225-050 4' SE.  The companion was extremely faint and small, round, weak concentration.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6301 = H IV-57 on 11 Jun 1787 (sweep 746) and recorded "suspected stellar; but too faint to be verified."  He confirmed the discovery on 12 Apr 1788 (sweep 831) and noted "F, stellar or a vS star involved in extremely F nebulosity.  Suspected in sweep 746."  His mean position from two observations matches UGC 10723.


Johann Palisa apparently independently rediscovered this galaxy at Vienna.  It was announced in AN 143 (#3412), and later recatalogued as IC 4643.  As Palisa's position matches NGC 6301, it's surprising Dreyer and Palisa missed the equivalence with NGC 6301.

V = 9.7;  Size 83"x24"


48" (5/3/19): amazing view of the Bug Nebula at 375x!  The central section was elongated roughly N-S and displayed an extremely high surface brightness. Four distinct "wings" were attached; two to the west and two to the east.  A surprisingly long wing is on the southwest side.  It has a noticeable bright section after dimming.  The wing tapers and then fades, stretching to the WNW for a total length of near 2'!  A mag 12 star is ~30" NW of the end of the wing.  The lowest surface brightness wing is on the NW side and extends in the direction of the mag 12 star for about 1' in length, but extends ~1.5' with averted vision.  The third extension on the southeast side is the narrowest and tapers at the east end. It appeared fairly uniform in surface brightness. Finally, the 4th and brightest wing is on the northeast side.  It extends towards the ENE but curls to the SE forming the shape of a "pincher claw" with the southeast wing.


18" (7/22/06): fascinating view unfiltered at 325x.  In the center is a very high surface brightness "core" of only 10"-12" in diameter that brightens slightly to the center and is encased in a larger, fainter envelope.  Two remarkable wings oriented WSW-ENE extend from the central core!  The following wing is much shorter but slightly brighter and this extension abruptly shoots towards the southeast near the end.  The much longer preceding wing heads WSW and is cut by a darker lane that detaches the western tip.


17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x (unfiltered) the Bug Nebula is a remarkable, high surface brightness object, elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, ~2.0x0.7'.  The intensely bright 10" core appears elongated SW-NE and is offset to the east of center. A quasi-stellar nucleus sharpens to a stellar point when the seeing steadies (this is not the central star, though).  The western wing is longer and is nearly split at the midpoint by a dark slash oriented N-S with a brighter condensation at the west end.  The shorter eastern wing is more pinched and just past its midpoint there is a kink and it angles towards the SE.


13.1" (7/27/84): structure highly suspected with the western extension cut by a dark lane.  The eastern extension bends north following the core.


13.1" (7/5/83): bright, fairly small, elongated E-W, very high surface brightness.  Subtle structure but the western extension is notably longer, brighter and possibly cut by a dark lane.


8" (6/27/81): fairly bright, small, elongated, bright core and brighter along the western extension.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 6302 in 1880 with his 5-inch refractor.  He wrote, "A small flickering indefinite nebula slightly elongated (east and west) with 5-inch refractor." This was the first nebula that Barnard found, though the discovery was not published until 1884 (AN 108, 369 and Sidereal Messenger, Vol 2, p226).  He noted "Prof. Swift, with his 16 inch refractor finds it to be a triple and elongated; its major axis nearly perpendicular to the meridian; a smaller nebula at each end, one of which is exceedingly faint.  Its place is from one observation with the meridian circle."  In 1892 Barnard made a detailed observation and sketch with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  As far as the popular nickname, Barnard commented, "from its singular appearance, I have called it the "Bug Nebula".


Dreyer noted "seems to be Dunlop 567 [found on 5 Jun 1826]" in the IC 1 Notes.  Dunlop's description reads "a very faint small ill-defined nebula, with a small star in it, with two small stars south of it, but not involved."  If this description applies to NGC 6302, his position was particularly bad -- 1.1° NE of the planetary.  But Glen Cozens, in a 2010 article in the "Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage" states "D 567 is an asterism, not the planetary nebula NGC 6302, as suggested by Hartung."  It's surprising the John Herschel missed this bright planetary during his sweeps.

Harold Corwin equates UGC 10711 with NGC 6303.  This galaxy is situated 28' north of Swift's position and 30 seconds of time east, but matches his comment "nearly between 2 stars."  Malcolm Thomson disagrees (in his CGCG Corrections) due to the discrepancy in RA and Dec.  All modern catalogues identify UGC 10711 as NGC 6303.

Appears flattened on the south or southeast side.  There was no significant central condensation although the central region was very mottled and a few faint mag 15-15.5 stars popped in and out of view.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6304 = H I-147 = h3670 on 30 Apr 1786 (sweep 559) and recorded "vB, R, gmbM, between 2 & 3' dia.  A very pretty object.  A miniature of M62."  His position is accurate.  JH made two observations from the Cape of Good Hope and described the cluster on sweep 478 as "B; R; at first s, the vgvlbM; brighter part 2' diam; but there is a much fainter portion which extends a good deal further; stars 16-17 mag."

14" (4/3/16 - Coonabarabran, 178x and 230x): moderately bright, small, slightly elongated, 20"x15" (probably the core region).  Two mag 13.5-14 stars just off the north side are collinear with the galaxy.  Located 32' NNW of mag 5.9 HD 156091 in a fairly rich star field.


The Stingray Nebula (He 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula, lies 23' SW.  It appeared ~13th magnitude and was stellar up to 230x.  It was easy to confirm by blinking with an NPB filter at 178x.  A mag 10.8 star is 35" W and provided an excellent comparison. This star is noticeably brighter unfiltered, but dimmer after inserting an NPB filter, so there was a very good filter response due to its strong OIII lines.


Up until around 1980, He 3-1357 was an ordinary B1 post-AGB star, but then it suddenly sprouted bright emission lines like a planetary nebula, and soon afterwards the HST discovered a small PN halo around the star, so apparently a star was caught in the act of ionizing a PN.


The brightening of the nebula likely stopped in the early 1990’s with the turn-off of the fast stellar wind associated with the 1980s ionization event. The fading of the nebula started afterwards in the early 1990s. At this time, the central star underwent fast fading and its illumination of the nebula declined from V = ~10.5 to currently ~12.5.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6305 = h3669 on 5 Jul 1836 and logged "vF; vS; R; glbM; 12"."  RNGC classifies this galaxies as an unverified southern object.


Joseph Turner sketched this object on 14 Jul 1876 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  He noted "the nebula has a stellar center as shown above [in sketch] and looks like a star of 14th magnitude surrounded by a slight haze."

24" (8/13/15): this very bright, bipolar, compact planetary was viewed at 375x and 500x. The two lobes are extended at least 3:2 NNW-SSE with an overall size of ~25"x16" and a pear shape.  A bright, roundish lobe is on the NNW side and a 12th magnitude star is off this side in the direction of the major axis [22" from center].  The smaller lobe on the SSE end is slightly fainter and separated by a small darker gap near the center.  A mag 15 star is just off the west edge [14" from center].  An extremely faint outer shell or extension was just visible bulging out on the east side perhaps 10", creating an asymmetric appearance.


24" (7/16/15): excellent view at 450x unfiltered.  The larger and brighter lobe on the north-northwest end appeared roughly circular and slightly brighter along the outer rim.  The smaller knot on the south-southeast end is slightly irregular and the nebulosity dims near the center.  A mag 12 star is just north of the north-northwest end.


18" (7/22/06): superb view at 807x!  This bipolar elongated planetary appears pear-shaped with the brighter, larger lobe on the north-northwest end and a smaller, slightly fainter nodule on the south-southeast end.  The nebulosity dims between the lobes but there appears to be a very small bridge of faint haze bridging the knots.


18" (7/20/06): at 325x this bi-lobed planetary is striking with a mag 12 star situated just off the northwest edge.  The PN is elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE in the direction of the neighboring star.  At the north-northwest end is the larger and brighter lobe with a smaller, fainter condensation forming the south-southeast end.  A very faint irregular halo encases the entire structure.  In moments of better seeing (overall the seeing was poor), the lobes were nearly resolved.


17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x using a UHC filter, this bright but compact PN was elongated 2:1 in the direction of a 12th magnitude star at the NNW edge, with dimensions of ~25"x12".  There is a large, bright lobe or condensation at the north end with a smaller, fainter knot at the SSE end.  At moments the lobes appear completely "resolved" with a darker gap in the center.  The view at 500x was excellent!  The fainter southern lobe appears elongated and slightly offset from the major axis of the PN.  The lobes are bisected by a darker lane oriented SW-NE and oblique to the minor axis.  The brighter knot at the north end has a mottled appearance and irregular shape.


13.1" (7/27/84): moderately bright, small, elongated NNW-SSE.  A mag 12 star is at the NNW edge 20" from the center.  Appears slightly brighter or a condensation is at the SSE end.


Wilhelm Tempel discovered NGC 6309 = T I-46 = T V-31 in 1876 using the 11" refractor at the Arcetri Observatory in Florence.  He only gave a rough position in his first discovery list I (AN 93, p. 59) but measured an accurate position in 1879 that was published in his fifth list.  Edward Pickering found the planetary on 15 Jul 1882 with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory using a direct-vision spectroscope and noted "nebula found by Tempel (GC 4851). Tempel's description 'between 2 stars' does not seem applicable."  There is only one close star.  Herbert Howe described NGC 6309 as a close double nebula, using the 20-inch refractor in Denver.  NGC 6309 is the only planetary discovered by Tempel.  Both this planetary and NGC 6445 are referred to as the "Box Nebula".


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "at first sight this nebula appears binuclear, but the southern condensation is not stellar.  Quite irregular; about 19"x10" in p.a. 163°.  The southern condensation is 7.5" from the central star."

The discovery was relayed directly to Dreyer as he was compiling the NGC and referenced as list VI in the NGC, though Swift published the discovery a couple of years later in list IX.

17.5" (8/27/92): moderately bright, fairly small, round, 2' diameter, broad concentration with no distinct core.  This globular was mottled across the disc but only marginally resolved with a few 16th magnitude stars visible.  A brighter mag 12 field star is off the SE edge by 1' and a mag 13 field stars is at the SW side and another 2' W of center.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6316 = H I-45 = h3671 on 24 May 1784 (sweep 224) and recorded "B, R, mbM, but the brightness decreasing very gradually. A faintish dusky red colour is still perceptible.  It is a perfect miniature of the former miniature [NGC 6293, which is itself a miniature cluster of the 19th of the Connoissance des Temps."  So he recognized NGC 6316 as a distant globular.


Dunlop probably observed the globular on 13 May 1826, recording "a very small faint round nebula, about 8" or 10" diameter, bright in the centre. There is a very small star south of the nebula, distant about 10" from it, but it is not involved or connected with the nebula."  Observed once, and his position is 36' too far east-southeast, so his identification is not certain.


JH made two observations from the Cape of Good Hope.  On 30 Jul 1834 he recorded "globular, B, R, gbM, resolvable, 90", has 2 small stars very near."  On a later sweep he logged "globular, pB, S, R, pgvmbM, 2', resolved into stars 16..17th mag."

James Dunlop possibly discovered NGC 6326 = D 381 = h3675 on 26 Aug 1826 and described "an extremely faint small nebula, about 12" diameter, with a bright point in the centre."  The size certainly fits, though his position was off by 24' (too far east) and this identification is uncertain.


Joihn Herschel gave two very detailed observations.  On 19 Jun 1835 he logged "planetary nebula, delicate, F, vS, diam = 6 or 7 arcseconds, exactly round, perfectly uniform (as respects the graduation of the light from the centre to the edges), but the light a very little curdled. Not the slightest haziness, but like a star out of focus.  320x shows rather more fur at the edges than I think it would to a planet of equal size and light. Its light is = a star 10-11th mag. It would be quite useless to look for this object under less favourable circumstances -- of instrument and sky. A night of gloriously perfect definition! It is in a very rich place. There are 40 or 50 small stars in field. Measures of the two companions; 1st pos = 351 degrees, dist = 1 diam from edge, star = 14th mag; 2nd pos = 91.4, dist = 2/3 diam, star = 13th mag. Showed it to my attendant, J. Stone, who saw it well".  His sketch in on Plate VI, figure 6.


In a later sweep (6 Jun 1837) the comment was added "Referring to the description of D 381, I see no ground to suppose that this can by possibility have been the object intended by that place and description.  At all events the remarkable planetary character has escaped notice by the author of that description."


Joseph Turner sketched the planetary on 16 Aug 1874 using the 48" Great Melbourne Telescope.  His sketch (unpublished plate VII, figure 74)  shows the two nearby stars and no additional features though he noted a softness at the edges and a slight "curdling" appearance.

William Herschel first observed this globular on 3 May 1783 with an 8-inch (10-foot focal length) and noted, "With a power of 250, I see several stars in it, and make no doubt a higher power, and more light, will resolve it all into stars. This seems to be a good nebula for the purpose of establishing the connection between nebulae and clusters of stars in general."  Using his 18.7-inch on 18 June 1784 (sweep 230) at 157x, he recorded "A vL and vB cluster of excessively compressed stars. The stars are but just visible, and are of unequal magnitudes: the large stars are red; and the cluster is a miniature of [M53].  Again on 28 May 1786, he reported "a cluster of extremely compressed, excessively small stars, with a very few scattered one chiefly to the north of it."

18" (7/17/07): The "Cat's Paw Nebula" is a fascinating HII complex and molecular cloud (RCW 17) with several distinct sections. At 73x and OIII or UHC filter, the brightest section or toe is on the southeast side (NGC 6334 = Gum 62) and consists of a 4'-5' glow extending mostly north of a mag 8.5 star (HD 156738) at 17 20.9 -36 04 (2000).  The nebulosity appears weaker on the SW side of the star and slightly brighter wrapping around the eastern side of the star.  John Herschel only described this section of the entire RCW 127 complex.


A second large section or toe forming the southwest component (VdBH 86 = Gum 61) lies 13' to the west and consists of a faint, 5' glow involving a 17" pair (HD 319703 at 17 19.8 -36 06).  This piece is asymmetric and appears as a broad fan sweeping north to SE from the central stars and is very weak or nonexistent to the SW of the stars.


A group of smaller pieces forming the northeast toe (Gum 64b) is 12'-15' N of the brighter SE section.  First is an obvious 2' glow surrounding a mag 10 star (HD 319702 at 17 20.8 -35 52.  A small, faint knot of nebulosity lies 3' W, no more than 1' in diameter.  This knot is also situated 2' SSE of a mag 9.5 star that is free from nebulosity.  But to the NW of this star another few arc minutes is a third detached piece of nebulosity (brightest part of Gum 64c), ~2' in diameter.  Very weak nebulosity appears to connect the NE section (Gum 64b) with the SE section (Gum 62).


Finally, midway between Gum 64b and Gum 61 a small extremely faint detached glow (Gum 64a) was glimpsed close SE of a mag 11 star at 17 20.1 -35 57.


13.1" (7/5/83): fairly easy nebulosity surrounds mag 8 star with UHC filter and extends 30' N.  This is an unusually large nebulosity, mostly visible surrounding stars and includes a close faint triple star.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6334 = h3678 on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded "pB; vL, v irr oval, in which, though eccentric is a *8, whose place is that taken.  One side of the neb is brighter than the other."  The next night he called this nebula "vF; vL; vglbM; 5'x4', out of M is a *8.9 or 9 mag, whose place is taken.  The densest part of the nebula follows this star 4.5 sec on the same parallel."


Massive HII region/molecular cloud complex with five distinct centers of massive star formation.


The nickname "Cat's Paw" apparently is from astrophotographer Jerry Lodriguss.  He writes "I believe that I was also the one who actually gave the "Cat's Paw" nebula its popular name. I started calling it that because of its resemblance to, of all things, a cat's paw (!), and because of its proximity to the "Cat's Eyes", Lambda and Upsilon Scorpii. I think the name was first published in an article I wrote in Sky and Telescope magazine in August of 1998, and documented in Hartmut Frommert's "A Collection of Some Common Names for Deep Sky Objects" on the SEDS web site."

24" (7/7/13): at 125x this Milky Way field (roughly 15') includes a mix of faint and moderately bright stars overlaying a bright Milky Way background glow.  Includes a 6' string, oriented NW to SE, of mag 11-12 stars as well as a group of a half-dozen stars mag 9.5-12 stars (brightest is HD 156543) about 9' SW.  Only some faint stars are visible between these groups over the glowing background, so it is not eye-catching.  South of this group the background glow dims due to dust clouds.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6335 = h3679 on 27 Jun 1837 and recorded "The whole lower end of the zone is strongly affected with nebulous patches."  There is no distinguishable cluster or nebula at his position, though Harold Corwin notes "the Southern Sky Survey films show a patchy field of star clouds, defined by the dust of dark nebulae. It is apparently these star clouds that JH saw in the summer of 1837, giving him the impression of patchy nebulosity all through his field."  Herbert Howe was unable to find NGC 6335, searching on a good night with both the 20-inch refractor and its 5-inch finder in Denver.


JH's original Cape position is 4° too far south, but he made a correction to the declination on his errata page at the end of the CGH.  The corrected position was used in his GC and copied by Dreyer from there into the NGC.

18" (7/16/07): at 220x and UHC filter the "Cheerio Nebula" is a gorgeous annular planetary, ~45" diameter with a large, dark circular hole of 25"-30" diameter.  The rim is uneven in surface brightness and perhaps brighter on the northeast side.  A mag 12.5 star is inside the northeast rim and a similar mag star is off the southwest side, along with a mag 13.5 companion.  An extremely faint star is on the SSW edge of rim.  At 323x, the striking rim appears brighter in a 50-60° arc centered on the brighter star on the NE side.  The amount of structure was surprising given the low altitude at -38.4° declination.


17.5" (6/30/00): very pretty annular planetary at 280x, ~45" and set in a rich star field.  A mag 12 star is superimposed on the inner edge of the NE rim and an extremely faint star is symmetrically placed at the SW edge.  The darker hole is 20"-25" diameter and perfectly circular.  The outer rim appears irregularly lit.


13.1" (5/30/87): at 166x with a UHC filter appears fairly faint, fairly small, roundish.  Slightly darker center (annular) with averted vision although the contrast with the rim is low due to the elevation.  No central star seen.


13.1" (7/5/83): at 144x-166x appears fairly small, faint but fairly easy, darker center (annular), somewhat like a smaller and dimmer version of M57.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6337 = h3680 on 28 Jun 1834 and recorded an "Annular Nebula.  A delicate, eF, but perfectly well defined annulus 15-20" diameter.  The field crowded with stars, two of which are on the nebula (see figure 3, Plate VI.)"  A later observation records "A beautiful delicate ring, of a faint ghost-like appearance, about 40" diameter; in a field of about 150 stars, 11 and 12 mag and under.  In it is one *12 mag very conspicuous, and one 15 mag much less so.  Near it are two stars 14 and 15 mag, and south of it at distance 60" is another."


Using his 48-inch from Malta, William Lassell also sketched a thin, perfectly symmetric ring with a star "perhaps 10.5 or 11 magnitude" on the north side and a faint one embedded on the south rim.  Joseph Turner made a similar sketch in 1874 with the 48-inch Great Melbourne Telescope (plate VII, figure 75, unpublished) as well as Pietro Baracchi in Sept. 1884 with the GMT.


The 5 superimposed stars were described in the 1921 Helwan Observatory list (based on photos taken in 1914-16) as follows: "Along a diameter of the ring in p.a. 25° is a line of stars, so straight as to suggest some connection with the nebula rather than a chance superposition.  The two brightest stars are at opposite ends of this line, that to the north being just inside the ring and the south one on the ring itself.  Between the central star and this south star is first (distant 5" from the former) a star 17-18 mag, and then either a still fainter star or possibly a small piece of nebulosity."

24" (7/21/17): NGC 6338 is the brightest in a compact group of 10 galaxies that was viewed at 375x.  It appeared bright, moderately large,  slightly elongated ~N-S, 1.25'x1.0'.  Moderately concentrated with a bright core that increases to a small brighter nucleus.


The following galaxies lie within 7' distance: CGCG 299-067 = VII Zw 700 is 1.2' N, NGC 6345 is 3.7' S, IC 1252 is 4.6' SE, NGC 6346 is 5.3' S, LEDA 2566799 (V = 15.5) is 5.6' NNE, LEDA 2567181 (V = 15.9) is 6.8' N and IC 1250 is 7.3' W.  CGCG 299-067, a merged double system with twin nuclei just 6" separation, appeared  faint to fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter.  A 20" pair of 13th magnitude stars is less than 1' NNE.  The object was suspected to be double but the nuclei were not cleanly resolved.


18" (7/12/07): brightest in a compact group of 7 galaxies (WBL 636 = NGC 6338 Group) viewed within a 10' circle.  At 262x, appears fairly faint, fairly small, oval 3:2 SSW-NNE, 0.6'x0.4', broad weak concentration.  A 22" pair of mag 13 stars lies 2' N.


Forms a close pair with MCG +10-24-117 just 1.2' N (sandwiched between NGC 6338 and the pair of stars).  The companion is very faint, small, round, 20" diameter.  Other members include NGC 6345 3.6' S, NGC 6346 5.3' S and IC 1252 4.5' SE.


17.5" (6/18/88): fairly faint, fairly small, oval SW-NE, broad concentration.  Brightest in a group with NGC 6345 4' S and NGC 6346 6' S in field.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6338 = H II-812 on 24 Apr 1789 (last object in sweep 928) and noted "F, S, R, vglbM.  The increase at a distance from the center."  His position (CH's reduction) is 30 sec of RA west of UGC 10784.  Bigourdan measured an accurate RA and noted the NGC RA was 16 seconds too small in the 18 Jan 1897 Comptes Rendus paper.


MCG misidentifies CGCG 299-067 (just north) as NGC 6338 and labels NGC 6338 as NGC 6345.  Error noted by Malcolm Thomson.

18" (7/26/06): at 325x this small 2' globular was well concentrated to a fairly bright 40" core.  A mag 12.5 star is off the SSW side of the halo [1.2' from center].  Perhaps a half dozen stars are resolved in the halo including three close stars on the NE side.  Additional stars are sometimes visible in the WSW side and the north side of the halo.  The core is very mottled and there is a strong impression of a couple of star lanes below the threshold of visibility.  Located 70' SE of M9.  B259, a large dark nebula, is located ~20' NE.


17.5" (7/27/92): moderately bright, fairly small, 2' diameter with an irregular outline, increases to fairly well-defined bright core, mottled.  A mag 12 is just off the south tip and a very faint extension or lane extends towards this star.  One or two very faint stars mag 14.5-15 are at the NE edge.  A less well-defined extension to the SW includes one or two threshold stars.  The cluster has a lively appearance but there was no additional resolution.

17.5" (8/1/89): this is a pair of mag 12/13 stars just 1' S of PGC 60004 (misidentified as NGC 6344 in the RNGC).  PGC 60004 appeared extremely faint and small, round.  Located 2.1' SW of mag 8 SAO 046612!


Gerhard Lohse discovered NGC 6344 around 1886 with the 15.5-inch refractor at the private Wigglesworth Observatory in England.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer and never published separately.  The NGC description states "F, S, R, *12 nf, nr."  At his position is a wide mag 13.5/12.5 pair at 23" that Harold Corwin identifies as NGC 6344.  From his description "*12 nf, near", though, it appears the fainter southwest star is NGC 6344.  In any case, considering Lohse's poor record of logging double stars as nebulous, this identification is fairly certain. Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position for the double star in 1898 (identified as NGC 6344).


RNGC and PGC misidentify PGC 60004 as NGC 6344.  This galaxy is only 1' north of Lohse's micrometric position, but Harold Corwin feels it is too faint to have been picked up by Lohse - and there is no nearby mag 12 star north-following.  HyperLeda now classifies NGC 6344 as a double star.

11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): at 127x appears fairly bright, moderately large, ~5' diameter, broadly concentrated to a 2' core.  Fairly well-resolved into ~30 stars, particularly along the south and southwest side of the halo.  A few faint stars were just resolved directly over the core.


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, fairly large.  Even at 128x, the cluster was fairly well-resolved into roughly 75 stars.  It displayed a rather loose concentration class with a broad central concentration to a moderately bright 3' core.  The irregular halo extended to nearly 8' diameter.  Set in a rich Milky Way field.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): moderately bright, fairly large, 5' diameter, fairly low surface brightness, not condensed, brighter core but no sharp nucleus.  Partially resolved into 5-10 faint stars mostly on the SW side.


13.1" (7/12/86): faint, small, diffuse, low surface brightness spot.  A few faint stars are off the SW edge but there is no resolution.  This is the farthest southern globular I've observed from Northern California (Digger Pines) with an elevation of only a couple of degrees.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6352 = D 411 on 14 May 1826 and recorded "A rather faint nebula, of an irregular round figure, 4' diameter, slightly branched; easily resolvable into stars, with slight compression of the stars to the centre."  His position is ~15' too far east (typical error). John Herschel didn't observe this globular from the Cape, so it doesn't have a General Catalog designation.


E.E. Barnard independently found it on 7 Jul 1885 (Sidereal Messenger 4, page 223) and assumed it was new since it was missing from the General Catalog, but Lewis Swift informed him of Dunlop's prior discovery.

Gerhard Lohse discovered NGC 6353 around 1886 with the 15.5-inch refractor at the private Wigglesworth Observatory in Scarborough, England.  His position (communicated directly to Dreyer) and description "pB, pS, 3 S st inv, * 10 nf 1'." applies to a small clump of stars.  RNGC classifies the number nonexistent (Type 7).

His description in Sidereal Messenger Vol 3, page 184, reads "small, faint object in a 6-inch telescope, the light being of an even tint.  There is a faint star a little south, which confuse the light of the nebula".  At his position there are three mag 12 and 13 stars in a tight knot, with a 4th fainter star.

The core appears slightly elongated N-S, although the halo is circular or slightly elongated WSW-ENE.  At 220x the globular appears lively and mottled but there is no obvious resolution.  At 280x and especially 380x, the edge of the halo is very ragged and the surface extensively mottled.  Around the periphery some threshold stars pop in and out of view, particularly on the south side.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6356 = H I-48 = h3683 on 18 Jun 1784 (sweep 230) and recorded "a large, bright, round, easily resolvable nebula, bM and the brightness diminishing gradually.  It is a miniature of the last [M9, which itself a miniature of M53] and I suppose if I had looked enough I might have perceived some of the stars that compose it."  From the Cape of Good Hope, JH recorded "globular, vB; R; vgvmbM; 90" resolved into stars barely resolvable with left eye.  A beautiful softly shaded object."

18" (7/16/07): at 115x a faint elongated hazy glow was visible just north of a nice 15" pair of mag 11/12 stars.  Adding an OIII filter dramatically improved this HII region (G353.19+0.91) and showed a bright, elongated nebulosity oriented WSW-ENE, ~5'x2', which appeared brighter in the middle just north of the double star.  A faint star is off the north side, oppositely placed from the double.  At 174x the nebula was slightly brighter and clumpy in the middle on the south side and a couple of very small slightly brighter knots were occasionally visible.  The group of stars to the south (including the double) is catalogued as Pismis 24.  Only the brightest portion of this huge HII complex was noticed.  NGC 6357 is located 8' WNW of mag 7 HD 157528 and this star is the northernmost of a 27' line of four mag 6-7 stars that extends to the south (nicknamed "Las Cuatro Juanitas" in Chile).  NGC 6334, the Cat's Paw Nebula, lies two degrees southwest..


17.5" (5/30/92): at 82x using an OIII filter, this emission nebula is a bright, distinctive object, elongated 3:1 E-W, 4.0'x1.5'.  A close mag 11/12 double star is at the south edge.  The whole field appears weakly nebulous and the nebulosity is just very faintly visible without a filter at 220x.  Excellent contrast gain with the OIII filter!  A group of a dozen faint stars is just south (= Pismis 24) including a double star.  This nebula is associated with the Wolf-Rayet star HD 157504 = WR 93, which is located east of the bright section.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6357 = h3682 on 8 Jun 1837 and recorded "F; L; E; vglbM; milky nebulosity; 2' l; 1 1/2' br; close to and almost involves a double star."  His position is on the double star mentioned in my observation.

17.5" (8/2/97): I'm not certain of the identification but the most noticeable object near Herschel's position in the 100x field is an elongated group of a dozen stars in a 8' string oriented NW-SE, which is just north of mag 7.5 SAO 185358 and ~15' NW of the NGC position.  There is a second mag 7.5 star 6' further NW and perhaps the two bright stars draw attention to this weak grouping but the patchy Milky Way background is also locally brighter here and immediate east of the group.  There was nothing of note at JH's position.  This object is just a Milky Way region as noted in ESO.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6360 = h3685 on 3 Aug 1834 and recorded "A portion of the milky way which is decidedly nebulous, and by no means rich in L stars."  There is no distinguishable cluster at his position and ESO says "stars only.  In a crowded region of the milky way."  Harold Corwin notes the "nebulous" appearance is due to dust in the Milky Way and affects a large region.  The brightest patches of stars is about a tmin W of JH's position and ~7'-8' N.  This corresponds with the ESO position.


Herbert Howe reported "on one good night nothing definite was discernible here.  However, the general background of the sky in this region was noted as being not so dark as would be expected if no nebulous matter were present."

This galaxy was discovered nearly 7 years earlier by Stephan in 1872 and catalogued as NGC 6138 = St II-2, though he transposed the digits of the offset star, so his published position (and the NGC) are in error.  Emmanuel Esmiol corrected the position when he re-reduced all of Stephan's discoveries at the Marseille Observatory (published in 1916).  So, NGC 6138 = NGC 6363.

Finally, Lewis Swift found the galaxy again on 11 Sep 1885 and reported "pF; vS; R; F * close; stellar."  His RA was 20 seconds too small.  Voigt's discovery was never published (his log was published in 1987) and Safford's discovery list was not published until 1887, so Dreyer credited Stephan in the NGC.

The rim's surface brightness is quite irregular with at least a couple of sharp brighter spots, the brightest on the northwest rim.


18" (7/14/07): striking view of this annular planetary at 280x.  The 30" halo is punctured by a relatively large 18" hole.  The rim is noticeably uneven in surface brightness with a brighter arc along the northern side.  Spectacular at 700x and the brighter northern rim has a couple of very small brighter spots.


18" (7/22/06): beautiful view at 435x.  The 30" annular ring is brightest along a "C" shaped section from NE moving clockwise to the SW and locally brighter at the NW end.  The central hole is round, well-defined and relatively large compared to the rim.


17.5" (6/30/00): at 500x this planetary has a beautiful annular appearance with a 25-30" halo perforated by a 12" dark hole.  The northern rim is noticeably brighter with a nearly stellar spot near its center.  Located 31' NW of mag 4.8 51 Ophiuchi.


17.5" (6/5/99): bright, beautiful annular planetary at 380x with a well-defined dark central hole.  The rim is clearly brighter along the north edge and slightly weaker on the following edge.


17.5" (7/4/86): bright, fairly small, about 30" diameter, green-blue color.  Appears as a perfect annular ring at 286x with a 15" central "hole".  No central star visible.


13.1" (8/5/83): use at least 220x to clearly resolve the annularity.


13.1" (7/16/82): beautiful ring at 214x and UHC filter, small, slightly elongated.  Visible with direct vision as annular.  The north edge of the rim appears brighter at 312x.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6369 = H IV-11 = h1981 = h3686 on 21 May 1784 (sweep 222) and recorded "a curious round, tolerably defined pB nebula 30 or 40" in diameter."  On 26 May 1786 (sweep 566), he called it "pB, R, S, of equal brightness throughout."  From the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel gave a detailed description: "Annular Nebula.  Exactly round; pF; 12" diameter; well terminated; but a very little cottony at the edge, and with a decided darkness in the middle; = a * 10m at the most.  Few stars in the field [situated in the bowl of the Pipe Nebula!]; a beautiful specimen of the planetary annular class of nebulae."  His published sketch is on Plate VI, figure 4.  Joseph Turner also sketched the planetary in Sep 1874 using the Great Melbourne Telescope (unpublished plate VII, figure 76).


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) described NGC 6369 as "a regular, nearly round ring, slightly longer in p.a. 120°; much fainter at the eastern end of the major axis and brightest at the north.  Diameter 28" center of ring perfectly blank. Quite faint; the ring just shows in 10m on S27. The central star is magn. 16."


John Mallas coined the nickname "Little Ghost" in his Apr/May 1963 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebula-IV", published in the "Review of Popular Astronomy".

William Herschel discovered NGC 6389 = H II-901 on 29 Jun 1799 (sweep 1090) and recorded "F, S, iF, er, about 2' long."  CH's reduced position is 20 seconds west of UGC 10893.  Christian Peters independently found this galaxy on 7 Jul 1878 while observing comet 1878a.  His position is a very good match with UGC 10893.

18" (7/30/08): extremely faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, low even surface brightness.  I could just barely hold this galaxy continuously with averted vision once it was identified but it took knowing the exact position to initially pick up.  This galaxy is generally identified as NGC 6394. Although Swift's description for NGC 6393 is a better match with this galaxy it's possible that it is too faint for Swift to have picked up.


17.5" (6/18/88): not found


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6393 = Sw. I-64, along with NGC 6394 and 6399, on 7 Jul 1885.  His description for NGC 6393 reads "vvF, pS, R, 2 B st nr north; south of 2" and for NGC 6394, "vvF, pS, R, 2 st point to it, the nearest is D[ouble]; the other and the nebula are equally distant from D star; north of 2."  The description of NGC 6394 is a perfect match UGC 10889 and NGC 6393 is possibly MCG +10-25-054.  The (unequal) double star is HD 159266, located 3.9' NW of NGC 6393.  This star is midway between NGC 6393 and a mag 11 star further NW.  Swift found the northern galaxy (NGC 6394) again on 15 Jun 1890 and included it in list IX-81, this time at the correct position.  The identification NGC 6393 = MCG +10-25-054 is uncertain as the separation in declination between the pair is 6.5', while Swift's gives just 3.5' and MCG +10-25-054 is perhaps too faint for Swift to have picked up with his 16-inch (see my visual description).  Edward Fath first suggested NGC 6393 may be MCG +10-25-054 (No. 789 in Table 1) and NGC 6394 may be UGC 10889 (No. 791 in Table 1) in his 1914 paper "A Study of Nebulae".


Swift's poor declination for NGC 6393 coincidentally matches UGC 10889.  As a result, all modern galaxy catalogues misidentify UGC 10889 as NGC 6393.  RNGC and PGC reverse the identifications of NGC 6393 and NGC 6394, labeling the fainter southern galaxy as NGC 6394.  MCG does not attach a NGC label to MCG +10-25-054.  See Harold Corwin's notes for NGC 6394.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): The view of this showpiece globular at 171x was amazing at nearly 70° elevation.  It extended across 2/3 of the field - perhaps 20' in diameter.  The cluster was very highly resolved into hundreds of stars, many surprisingly bright at mag 10-11 and overall noticeably brighter than most globulars (1st in ranking of brightest stars).  The globular appeared fully resolved in the halo and even the blazing core was covered wall-to-wall with stars.  Many of the stars are arranged in small groups, chains, curves, etc.  The concentrated core appeared ~3.5' diameter and at 228x had a 3-dimensional appearance with the mag 10.5-11.5 stars layered over a dense, uneven background carpet of stars.  Visible naked-eye.


20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I also had a fantastic view in the 20" f/5 at 212x - the stars seemed to radiate out from the core in spiral curves and completely filled the 23' field!


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, very large, 10' diameter, irregularly round.  At least 50 stars mag 10-12 are resolved at 63x.  Bright intense core 3' diameter with dozens of stars superimposed and at the edges of the core.  The cluster contains a large halo with many faint and brighter stars superimposed over a mottled background.  Beautiful globular although observed at only 13° elevation from Baja.  This is the nearest globular and first in ranking by brightest stars.


10x30 (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): picked up while sweeping in IS binoculars close to the SSW horizon from Haleakala.  Once the position was pinpointed, this mag 5.8 globular was just visible naked-eye less than 1 degree NNE of mag 5.3 Pi Arae.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6397 = Lac III-11 = D 366 = h3692 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He simply noted "faint star in nebulosity."  James Dunlop independently found this globular on 28 Jun 1826 with his 9-inch reflector and described "a pretty large nebula, extended nearly in the parallel of the equator, brightest and broadest in the middle; a group of very small stars in the middle give it the appearance of a nucleus, but they are not connected with the nebula, but are similar to other small stars in this place which are arranged in groups. The nebula is resolvable into stars."  Dunlop made 4 observations and his position was 5' east of center.


On John Herschel's first observation (8 Jul 1834), he recorded "globular cluster; fine; large; bright; round; gradually brighter to the middle; not very compressed; 5' diameter, but stragglers extend a great way. In the middle is a more compact group of much smaller stars. The stars at circumference are larger than in the middle; at N.f. border is a double star."

It is certainly a nebula, and with long attention, I see another [NGC 6403], still fainter, exactly on parallel, and 30 seconds following."  His position is accurate.


Nevertheless, the RNGC classified both galaxies as nonexistent (Type 7) probably because DeLisle Stewart reported "eF, hazy * only" based on plates taken at Harvard's Boyden Station, in Arequipa, Peru.

The cluster is elongated N-S with a nice string extending through the cluster to the SSE and NNE with a slight bend near the center.  At the kink in the center of the string is a denser clump of stars.  There are circular voids on the NW and SW ends.  The two brighter strings (on the following side) and two less distinct rows of stars create a vague "X" shape through the cluster with a loop of stars on the north end.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6401 = H I-44 = h1982 = h3697 on 21 May 1784 (sweep 222) and recorded "cB, pL, having a kind of nucleus towards the following side."  On 26 May 1786 (sweep 566), he called it "pB, gbM, L, r, some of the stars visible."  From the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel logged "pB; R; vgbM; 25"; a * 13m involved, following the centre."


Sven Cederblad catalogued this globular as the nebula Ced 149.  This incorrect classification is probably from Julius Scheiner, who gave its spectrum as gaseous (before 1912) at the Potsdam Observatory.

24" (7/30/16): at 432x; very bright, large, nearly fills the 10' field.  The outer halo is resolved into dozens of star, perhaps 50 or 60 total.  The relatively large core is plastered with tiny resolved stars; roughly 50 additional stars were resolved over a lively background, so overall at least a 100 total though difficult to count due to density and the bright background glow.  The outer halo is slightly elongated E-W as well as the core, but the overall appearance is symmetrical.  The core only exhibits a broad, weak concentration.


17.5" (7/1/00): this bright, large, fairly symmetric globular appears elongated ~E-W and ~7'x5' in size at 220x.  The bright core is relatively large at 4', very lively and granular with a layer of very faint stars.  At 280x, ~30 stars are resolved in the small halo and at the edge of the intense core.  A rich, even sprinkling of faint stars cover the core.  It was difficult to count the resolved stars as numerous dim stars pop out with averted vision over the bright background haze, but perhaps 60-70 stars in total were glimpsed.


17.5" (7/16/88): bright, large, 25-30 very faint stars are resolved mostly at the edges which have a ragged appearance.


13" (7/5/83): fairly large, broad concentration.  About a dozen very faint stars are resolved across the disk.  The outer halo fades out smoothly.


Charles Messier discovered M14 = NGC 6402= h1983 on 1 June 1764 and noted a "Nebula without star, discovered in the garb which dresses the right arm of Ophiuchus, and situated on the parallel of Zeta Serpentis: This nebula is not large, its light is faint, one can see it nevertheless in an ordinary telescope of 3.5-foot [FL]; it is round, near it is a small star of 9th magnitude."


William Herschel, observing with his 12-inch (small 20-foot) on 23 Jul 1783, noted "With a power of 200, I see it consists of stars. They are better visible with 300. With 600, they are too obscure to be distinguished, though the appearance of stars is still preserved. This seems to be one of the most difficult objects to be resolved. With me, there is not a doubt remaining; but another person, in order to form a judgment, ought previously to go through all the several gradations of nebulae which I have resolved into stars." On 25 May 1791 (sweep 1010), he recorded with his 18.7-inch, "eB, R, easily resolvable.  With a power of 300 I can see the stars.  Resembles the 10th of the Connoiss. which probably would put on the same appearance as this, if it were off half as far again as it is."


On 30 May 1821, his second night of being instructed how to sweep and record objects, 29-year old John Herschel logged M14 as "a globular cluster of excessively small stars, barely but certainly resolved with the examining power and difficult with the sweeping power, brighter in the middle."  The sweep was registered out of order in his Slough Catalogue as sweep 54.

18" (7/21/04): at 92x roughly 200 stars are visible in this beautiful naked-eye cluster.  There are four bright mag 6-7 stars in the main group which form a perfect parallelogram with longer sides of 7' oriented WSW-ENE and shorter sides of 4' oriented NW-SE.  A string of stars connects the two stars on the long southern side of the parallelogram (the star at the SE vertex is orange-tinged BM Sco) with a nice double star embedded in the string.  The NW vertex is part of a bright isosceles triangle with two mag 8-9 stars and ~7' further NW of this star is a small, nice asterism consisting of a trio and a double.  Also a wedge-shaped group of 7 stars extends between this NW vertex (which also has two additional fainter companions) and the SW vertex (short side of parallelogram) Another distinctive string of stars runs through the center of the parallelogram roughly parallel to the two long sides.  A nice mag 9/10 double resides along the long northern side of the parallelogram.  An additional mag 7 star is the SW of the parallelogram.  Around the main group there are numerous scattered stars and the cluster does not have a distinct border.  Over 70 stars in the cluster are brighter than 11th magnitude.


13.1" (7/5/83): very bright, fairly large.  Includes a curving rows of stars and a close group of 7 stars near the center.  The brightest star BM Scorpii is on the east side.  Smaller than M7 but richer.  Fairly easy naked-eye cluster.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered M6 = NGC 6405 = Lac III-12 = h3699 before 1654 and recorded 18 stars.  De Chéseaux independently found the cluster in 1745-46.  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille found the cluster again in 1752 with a 0.5-inch telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, and found a "remarkable group of faint stars in parallel lines making a diamond 20-25 minutes diameter filled with nebulosity."  Lacaille is credited with the discovery in the NGC. James Dunlop's D 612 may refer to M6 as his position falls on the east side of the cluster, though D 612 could apply to NGC 6416, given his often poor positions.  Although a naked-eye cluster, it apparently was not included in any earlier list.


In his Messier survey, WH logged on 30 Jul 1783 "I counted about 50 stars; it contains the greatest variety of magnitudes of any nebula I recollect. The compound eye-piece shows more of them variously and intermixed."


According to Sue French, the popular nickname "Butterfly Cluster" may come from "Splendour of the Heavens" (1923), as M6 is described as "somewhat irregular in shape, with central rib of stars, and resembles a butterfly with open wings."

William Herschel discovered NGC 6412 = H VI-41 on 12 Dec 1797 (sweep 1071) and surprisingly described this galaxy as a cluster of class VI (very condensed and rich clusters of stars) -- "round, resolvable, about 3' diameter, vgbM. I suppose it to be a cluster of stars compressed extremely. 320 power confirms the supposition, and shews a few of the stars; it must be immensely rich."

John Herschel discovered NGC 6415 = h3701' on 26 Aug 1826 and recorded "a great Nebulous projection of the milky way." His RA is given roughly to the nearest minute of time.  In the Cape Catalogue, JH did not assign a number, but placed it (in RA order) after h3701, so Dreyer called it h3701' in the NGC.  This is likely just a rich section of the Milky Way and RNGC and ESO list the number as "Not found".  Harold Corwin places the center about 1 minute of time larger than JH's position and 3'-4' south.


Wolfgang Steinicke lists James Dunlop with the discovery (numbers D 595 and D 596), but Glen Cozens associates these number with Ruprecht 128. Dunlop described a much smaller object than JH's h3701' -- D 595 is only 1' diameter and D 596 is 5' x 30".

17.5" (8/2/97): best view at 100x as it fills the 220x (9mm Nagler) field.  The most detached portion consists of a large cloud of at least 15' diameter and containing roughly 75 stars.  There are four brighter stars (including mag 8.6 SAO 209208) but most of the stars are pretty uniform in brightness and fairly evenly distributed at 100x.  The cluster may extend further north than the region described above but the star density quickly decreases to the general Milky Way appearance.


8" (6/19/82): almost two dozen faint stars, large, scattered, not impressive as fairly coarse.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6416 = h3702 = D612? on 3 Aug 1834 and recorded "Cl class VIII of stars 11m; fills field; not rich; stars in zig-zag lines."  His position is accurate.  James Dunlop possibly discovered the cluster earlier on 13 May 1826 and described "a cluster of small stars of mixt magnitudes, about 15' diameter, irregular figure."   His position, though, is nearly 40' west of the cluster and actually falls on the east side of M6, 13' from the center.  So, his identification is uncertain though seems to describe NGC 6416 better.

Harold Corwin notes it is very possible that NGC 6423 (discovered by Swift 16 days earlier) is an earlier observation of this galaxy and NGC 6422 is an earlier observation of NGC 6420.  But Guillaume Bigourdan assigned the numbers to the four brightest galaxies in the field, which are a good match with Swift's declinations (the RAs are 14 to 24 seconds too small).  Bigourdan's corrected positions for all 4 galaxies (measured in Sept 1888), were published in the IC 2 Notes.

Includes a nice string of a half-dozen stars (mag 9.5-11.5) on the southeast side and a couple of 1' pairs (oriented N-S) of mag 10.5-11.5 stars are at the east end of the cloud.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6421 = h3702' on 3 Aug 1834 and recorded "A most remarkable, well insulated, semi-nebulous milky way patch of a branching rounded figure, within the limits of the field, quite insulated on the p, n and f side, and only connected on the south side by a narrow isthmus with a branch of the milky way, which runs meridionally to a great extent.  It forms a VI. class cluster of the utmost tenuity, barely resolvable, no resolved.  See [sketch] fig 1, plate V."   JH listed this observation (and coordinates) after h3702, but didn't assign it a unique h-designation (it's called 3702 1/2 in his list of sketched nebulae), indicating it was just an interesting field and not a discrete object.  He included it, though, in the GC as h3702', but Dreyer dropped the prime in the NGC.  As a result there are two NGC listings for h3702 (NGC 6416 and NGC 6421).


Joseph Turner searched unsuccessfully for this object witht the Great Melbourne Telescope on 25 Sep 1875.

17.5" (8/7/02): at 220x appeared as a faint, moderately large edge-on oriented E-W, 1.2'x0.3' with a low even surface brightness.  A mag 13.7 star is at the following end 50" from the center and the galaxy extends nearly due west.


Albert Marth's position for NGC 6430  was off by 38 tsec in RA and although his description matches, modern catalogues and the U2000 (second edition) identify this galaxy as UGC 10966.  Karl Reinmuth identified NGC 6430 as a chain of 4 stars and the RNGC followed suit classifying NGC 6430 as nonexistent.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6430 = m 344 on 2 Jun 1864 and noted "vF, S, mE."  There is nothing at his position, but 38 seconds of time east is UGC 10966, and Marth's description is appropriate for this galaxy.


Karl Reinmuth failed to find NGC 6430 in his photographic survey using Heidelberg plates and wrote "no mE neb seen; a chain of 4 st 14-15, 150°, in 17h 38.9m (1860)".  Based on Reinmuth, RNGC misclassifies the number as nonexistent with the note "4 stars".

Édouard Stephan found NGC 6431 = St I-7 on 23 Jun 1870.  This was his first "discovery" but Bigourdan (visually) and Reinmuth (on Heidelberg plates) found nothing at his position.  However, Harold Corwin found that Stephan misidentified his comparison star and once corrected his position matches NGC 6427 = UGC 10957, which Albert Marth had discovered earlier on 2 Jul 1864.  So, NGC 6431 = NGC 6427.  This is one of Stephan's few errors that were not caught by Emmanuel Esmiol during his re-reduction of Stephan's positions ("Réduction des Observations de Nébuleuses Découvertes par M. Stephan", 1916).

18" (8/19/09): at 73x (31mm Nagler) appeared as a very large group or star cloud of over 100 stars, mostly mag 10-13, in a 30'x15' region elongated NW to SE.  The mass of stars is just west of mag 7.3 HD 161855 and is fairly well detached in the Milky Way field except on the NW side where a stream of stars extends to the north and then spreads out into another rich star cloud.  The brightest star within NGC 6437 is mag 7.6 HD 161561 on the NW side with a faint companion 25" N.  The background glow of the Milky Way surrounding the group is bright, patchy and overall very striking in the entire 67' field.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6437 = h3704 on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded "A very decided, tolerably defined semi-nebulous mass in milky way, with abundance of vS st, forming altogether a telescopic magellanic cloud.  It fills about a field, and has branches and sinuses and is altogether a remarkable object".  On the DSS, this is a rich Milky Way field (JH's position is at the southeast side), which is detached on the east end by dust.  ESO did not include it as a cluster and RNGC also classifies the number as nonexistent.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, the appearance of this interacting pair was very strange!  NGC 6438 appeared moderately bright, small, round, 0.4' diameter.  NGC 6438A (a disrupted peculiar galaxy) is attached on the east side and appeared as a faint, diffuse glow, elongated SW-NE, ~0.8'x0.5'.  This system is the second closest NGC galaxy to the south celestial pole and is located 4' NE of a mag 9.5 star (an uncatalogued double star) and 16' NE of mag 8 HD 160820.  Mag 6.4 HD 159517 is 28' NW.


NGC 6438A appears highly disrupted on the DSS, with two extensions or arms (perhaps two different interacting galaxies).


John Herschel discovered NGC 6438 = h3701 on 2 Jun 1835 and logged "pB; R; vgbM.  RA rudely taken, and may be very erroneous."  His RA was 3 minutes of time too large, though this translate to only 3.6' in the sky at this far southerly declination.


Pietro Baracchi observed NGC 6438 on 3 Oct 1885 with the Great Melbourne Telescope and described a "Double nebula or a small round pretty bright, [?], pmbM almost to a star like nucleus, with faint roundish flat appendage south following about 40" in diameter which might be a close companion to [NGC 6438]."  His sketch clearly shows a double galaxy with a bright, small nebula on the NW side (NGC 6438) and a larger, fainter glow (NGC 6438A) attached on the SE edge.

18" (7/25/06): easily picked up at 115x as a quasi-stellar light-blue mag 12.5 "star" just 1' S of a mag 10.4 star.  Very good response to the OIII filter.  A very small disc was visible at 225x, perhaps 3" in size.  Adding a UHC filter this compact planetary was similar in brightness to the mag 10.4 star and appeared to increase slightly in diameter.  At 435x a small oval, ~4"x3" was resolved of uniform surface brightness except it seemed to fade around the periphery, hinting at a thin faint envelope.  Located in the NW corner of Sgr near the border of Ophiuchus and Serpens Cauda.


13.1" (7/12/86): fairly bright stellar planetary at 79x, verified with OIII blinking.  At 166x a mag 10.5 star just 1.2' N is perfectly placed for blinking comparison!  Appears stellar at 214x.  Estimate V = 12.0-12.5.


Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6439 on 18 Aug 1882 with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory using a direct-vision spectroscope. He reported the discovery in AN 2459 and Sidereal Messenger, Oct 1882 and noted "mag 13. A star, mag 11, north 1' and follows 1 second."  His position and description is accurate.  Megastar (and probably other sources) misidentify the mag 13 star that is 1' north as NGC 6439.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) described NGC 6439 as "a minute round disk 5" in diameter, there is a very wind in p.a. 290°.  The disk is slightly fainter at the edges."

24" (8/14/15): at 375x; bright, relatively small globular, sharply concentrated with a very bright core and a much fainter, well-defined circular halo, roughly 2' across.  The core was mottled and very granular but unresolved.  NGC 6440 is collinear with an 11' string of four mag 11-12 stars extending from NW to SE, barely fitting in the field, with the closest star 1.7' NNW of center.  At 500x, a few extremely faint stars were resolved in the halo.  The bright core contains a handful of resolved stars (mag 16.5 or fainter) that popped in and out of view over the extremely granular background.


NGC 6440 is a highly obscured, metal-rich globular at a low galactic latitude, so resolution is quite difficult.


17.5" (7/14/99): this globular forms an unusual pair with planetary NGC 6445 just 21' NNE and is situated within a string of four mag 11-12 stars oriented NW-SE.  It appears fairly faint, round, at least 2' diameter.  At 280x the diffuse halo increases to a moderately bright, round core.  Although the globular appears granular, there was no resolution in good seeing except for a very faint star that was intermittently visible off the north edge of the core.


13.1" (6/29/84): moderately bright, small, broadly concentrated to a brighter core, no resolution.  Forms a striking pair with planetary NGC 6445 20' NNE.  Brightest member stars are only V = 17.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6440 = H I-150 = h1985 on 28 May 1786 (sweep 569) and recorded "cB, R, vgmbM, about 1 1/2' diameter."


Based on early Crossley plates of the region, Heber Curtis wrote a note in 1918PASP...30..161C titled "A Spiral Nebula in the Milky Way."  He stated "The nebula NGC 6440 appears to form practically the only known exception to this rule [that spiral nebulae are never found in the Milky Way itself].  Although this object is some distance from the center of all available Crossley plates of this region, rendering its details somewhat indistinct, there seems to be no doubt that it is a rather bright, nearly round, very compact, spiral nebula 1.5' in diameter.  Its unusual interest lies in the fact that it is less than 2° from the galactic plane."  Before this erroneous note was published a footnote was added stating another plate was taken and "the probabilities are that it is a compact star-cluster showing evidences of spiral formation."  Based on photographs taken at the Helwan observatory in 1919-20, the description also reads "some indication of the stars being in spiral formation".

17.5" (7/14/99): NGC 6441 is situated just 4.5' following mag 3.2 G Scorpii!  At 220x it appeared moderately bright, round, ~2.7' diameter, fairly sharp concentration with a prominent 1' core.  A mag 11 field star is at the southwest edge of the halo (1.3' SW of center), a mag 13.5 star is just inside the west edge of the halo (1.2' from center), and a mag 12.5-13 star is just off the northwest side.  There was no definite resolution into cleanly visible stars, although the globular had a granular appearance.  H 1-36, a symbiotic star (mimics a stellar planetary), is located just 1.3' NW of the mag 3.2 star!


13" (6/18/85): very bright core, mottled halo but no certain resolution.  Located just 4.5' E of G Scorpii (V = 3.2), which hampers viewing.


8" (5/21/82): bright, intense core.


80mm finder (7/14/99): the globular was easily visible at 21x in the finder.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6441 = D 557 = h3705 on 13 May 1826 with his 9-inch f/12 reflector at Paramatta.  He described "a small well-defined rather bright nebula, about 20 arcseconds diameter, a very small star precedes it, but it is not involved; following gamma Telescopii."  He observed this globular on 5 nights and his position is just 2' south of center (unusually accurate for him).


John Herschel first recorded on 28 Jun 1834, "globular cluster, B, R, 90", vgbM, resolvable (barely so), a very regularly graduating neb or cluster; in field with gamma Telescopii."  The next night he logged "globular, B, R, vgbM, up to a blaze. In field with Gamma Telescopii, and nearly on the same parallel; with left eye I barely see it resolved into stars 18 or 20m. The whole ground of the heavens, for an immense extent, is thickly sown with such stars. A beautiful object."  Christian Peters claimed he discovered it around 1850, while at the Capodimonte Observatory in Naples (AJ 2, 1856).

17.5" (7/8/94): about 50 stars in a 10' string oriented due E-W.  Stands out reasonably well in the field at 100x.  Very uniform in mag 12-13 stars over some unresolved haze.  A more ill defined branch of stars begins at the west end and trails NE.  An arc of stars begins at the east end and curls back west on the south side.  Located in the same low power field with globular NGC 6453 20' NE and 53' due west of the center of M7.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6444 = h3706 = D 597? on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded "A very fine L, rich sc cl of st 12...13m."  His position is 40 seconds of RA too large, but marked the coordinates with a +/-, indicating uncertainty.


James Dunlop possibly discovered the cluster earlier on 28 Jun 1826 and logged Dun 597 as a "pretty large faint nebula, easily resolvable.  This precedes a cluster of stars."  Dunlop made a single observation and his position is 26' too far east-southeast, but this cluster is due west of M7 by 52', so this identification is certainly reasonable.

V = 10.9;  Size 38"x29";  Surf Br = 9.9


24" (8/14/15): this highly structured planetary was observed using 500x.  NGC 6445 has an unusual rectangular shape, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, with dimensions ~45"x30".  The planetary is brighter in fairly narrow strips along the four sides, creating an annular appearance.  The short northwest facing side is slightly brighter and contains a bright knot or section near the middle.  In addition, a faint knot is at the north vertex.  Another bright knot is at the east vertex and either a faint knot or very faint star is at the south vertex.  The short southeast facing side is sharply defined and quite straight. A very low surface brightness glow can be seen outside (east) of the eastern vertex.  In addition, with careful viewing an extremely faint outer shell or loop is outside the long southwest facing side, connected at the two vertices along this side.  A mag ~15.5 star is just outside the midpoint of the loop.  The outer shell or loop on the northeast side was not seen.


18" (7/22/06): this fascinating planetary was viewed at 435x.  The overall shape is rectangular with the longer sides oriented NW to SE.  Both ends are noticeably brighter giving an annular appearance.  The NW end is slightly brighter and irregular in surface brightness with a brighter spot or two.  The rim at the northwest end is slightly bowed out and has a well-defined boundary edge in the interior.  The rim at the southeast end of the planetary is unusually straight and well-defined.  With averted vision it appeared to extend slightly beyond the main body of the planetary.  The bright lobe at this end is bar-shaped and extended SW to NE in the direction of the minor axis.


17.5" (7/14/99): this bright PN is striking at 280x with a great deal of structure evident.  It has a boxy appearance, elongated NW-SE with dimensions ~45"x30".  The ends of the major axis are clearly brighter with a bright, shallow arc or crescent-shaped curve on the NW end.  This lobe has an irregular surface brightness with a couple of brighter spots.  The SE lobe is brighter but has an oddly flat edge.  At 380x, the eastern end of the southeast lobe is brighter and has a small extension or nodule that bulges out beyond the rectangular outline to the east.  The center is clearly darker and with careful viewing appears as a dark band running SW-NE.  A mag 12 star lies ~45" NW of center and the planetary precedes a wide uneven mag 8/10.5 pair by 5'.  The planetary forms an unusual pair with GC NGC 6440 20' SSW.


13" (8/5/83): bright, fairly small, elongated NW-SE, brighter along the NW side.  A darker center visible at 288x appears to cut through the minor axis. The NW edge is slightly curved while the other sides and corners are "boxy" giving an irregular rectangular outline.  The ends of the minor axis are fainter.  A wide double star h2810 = 7.7/10.5 at 41" lies 5.3' E.  A mag 12 star is just off the NW end about 40" from the center.  Forms a striking pair with globular cluster NGC 6440 20' SSW in the same low power field.


13.1" (7/16/82): dark center at 280x appears to bisect the planetary ~E-W.


8" (6/27/81): fairly bright, elongated, uniform.  Located within string of four mag 11/12 stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6445 = H II-586 = h1986 on 28 May 1786 (sweep 569) and recorded "pB, S, iF." He placed it in his class II of "Faint Nebulae". John Herschel called this planetary "pB; pL; R; r; 40"."  On 11 Mar 1848, LdR (or assistant William Rambaut) described NGC 6445 as "curious circular-shaped neb with large dark spot at one side [f side in a diagram], around which is a close cluster of well defined vS stars."  Edward Pickering apparently found NGC 6445 while searching with a direct-vision spectroscope at Harvard College Observatory (Sidereal Messenger, Oct 1882).  In 1887, Frank Muller reported with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory, "Two nuclei forming an elliptical nebula, elongated 150°, largest diameter 26", northern nucleus brighter.  A sketch shows each nucleus to be elongated in the direction 90° +/-, the center being almost devoid of nebulosity.  The nuclei are entirely separated from each other except by very faint nebulosity, and are of the 12.5 magnitude."


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported "..the brighter portioin is a very irregular "square-shouldered ring 38"x29"; from this extend very faint ring like ansae in p.a. 50-230°, along which the total length is about 50".  Brightest on NW edge..."  Based on Helwan photographs in 1919-20, it was reported as "trapezium-shaped object with very sharp corners; the two parallel sides are considerably brighter than the other pair and lie in p.a. 60° and 240°; the NE corner is a right angle; no indication of a central star."


The Sky Catalogue 2000, Volume 2 and the Deep Sky Name Index 2000 incorrectly refer to NGC 6445 as the "Little Gem".  The nickname applies to NGC 6818 (from John Mallas).  John Mallas coined the nickname "The Crescent" in his Apr/May 1993 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebulae-IV", but the nickname didn't stick.

The brightest of the three faint stars is at the east end, though all three are near V = 15.5.  Located 15' S of 5.8-magnitude HD 161693.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6448 = Sw. II-60 on 16 July 1885 and logged "vF, pS, R, lbM".  There are no galaxies near his position, but about 30 seconds of RA preceding is a east-west string of 3 very faint stars and one brighter star that may be Swift's object.  According to Harold Corwin's identification notes, Jeff Corder suggested this possible identification. RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6450 = Sw. II-61 on 1 Jul 1884 and logged "vF; vS; B * f 8 seconds; bet 2 sts."  There are only faint stars near his position and the nearest faint galaxies in the CGCG have no nearby bright star, so clearly there is an error in his position.  Both Bigourdan and Herbert Howe were unsuccessful in finding NGC 6450.  Father Hagen notes in the Vatican Zone Catalogue that there no "B*" in this place.


No modern catalogue has an entry for NGC 6450 and Harold Corwin was also unable to recover this object despite the specific description.

24" (7/7/13): at 125x (50' field), this position corresponds with a very large, bright Milky Way field just southwest of M7.  The field includes a nice mix of mag 7 and fainter stars centered near a bright, very wide pair (mag 7 HD 162145 and mag 8.5 HD 320780).  The Milky Way background here is glowing, but the field itself is not special considering the region, and it certainly does not appear cluster-like.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6455 = h3709 on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded "a very extensive nebulous clustering mass of the milky way.  The stars of excessive smallness, and infinite in number."  His position is marked uncertain, possibly due to the large size of the field but falls close to mag 7.3 HD 162287.  Harold Corwin notes this is probably just a random clumping of Milky Way stars near SAO 209348.


RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent and ESO has only a placeholder for the NGC designation.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6465 = h1988 on 1 Jul 1826 and noted "suspected; small; twilight."  At his position is a small group of 5 stars, including two double stars (an additional star is to the southeast).  Herbert Howe, observing in 1888-1889 with a 20-inch refractor, reported "search was made for this on two nights.  On the first no nebula could be found.  On the second, it was discovered that, instead of a nebula, there are simply two doubles of mag 12.  In each pair the distance is 4", and the two pairs are 15" apart."

17.5" (6/11/88): extremely faint and small, round.  In a crowded region of NGC 6456 group with NGC 6470 1.3' ESE, NGC 6471 2.4' SSE and NGC 6463 3.2' SW.  Misidentified as NGC 6477 in the RNGC.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6472 = Sw. V-79, along with NGC 6456, 6471 and 6477, on 25 Sept 1886.  His description simply comments on how faint and small this galaxy appeared.  He notes this is the "5th of 6" in the group, and the declination is the furthest north.  His position is 7 sec of RA east and 1' north of PGC 2703230 (the furthest north), though this galaxy precedes both the candidates for NGC 6470 and 6471. Still, the most reasonable assignment is NGC 6472 = PGC 2703230.


NGC 6472 is mislabeled as NGC 6477 in the RNGC.  Furthermore, NGC 6470 = UGC 10974 (discovered by Swift earlier on 9 Jun 1886) is misidentified as NGC 6472 in RNGC, UGC, CGCG and MCG.  See Corwin's notes to NGC 6456 for more.

NGC 6473

17 46 54 +57 18.5; Dra


= Not found, Gottlieb.  Possibly = UGC 10980, Corwin.


Lewis Swift found NGC 6473 = Sw. IV-57, along with NGC 6474 = Sw. IV-58, on 22 Jul 1886 and recorded "eeF; S; R; s of 2."  UGC 10989 is the only galaxy close to his two nearly identical positions.  A mag 16.5 star is close north of this galaxy and a mag 17.5 star a bit further south, but these are probably too faint for Swift to have picked up.  His very detailed description for NGC 6474 clearly establishes its identity with UGC 10989.


Unless he somehow recorded NGC 6474 twice that evening, Harold Corwin mentions UGC 10980 as a possibility (suggested by Jeff Corder).  This galaxy is bright enough to be picked up by Swift, though is located nearly 10' west-southwest.  I'm skeptical, though, because of the discrepancy in position and because there is no reference to a mag 13.5 star at its west edge.  So, I've listed NGC 6473 as "Not Found" here.

17.5" (7/19/90): very faint, small, slightly elongated 3:2 WSW-ENE, small bright core.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6474 = Sw. IV-58 on 22 Jun 1886 and recorded "eF; pS; R; 3 st. in a line nr and 3 others in a line point to it; e diff; n of 2."  His position is 12 seconds of RA west of UGC 10989 = PGC 60850 and his description applies.  The "3 st. in a line nr" are probably the three equally spaced stars to the southwest in a 3.7' string.  The "3 others in a line point to it" refer to three stars to the northeast.  See NGC 6473, recorded the same night as the "s of 2", has a nearly identical position.  But, there is only a single galaxy here, so Swift made some error.  See that number for more.


UGC identifies UGC 10989 as NGC 6473, MCG labels it NGC 6474, and CGCG labels it NGC 6473 = NGC 6474.  Since the description of NGC 6474 is more complete and unambiguous, it makes sense to use it as the primary designation.

NGC 6475 = M7 = ESO 394-9 = Cr 354 = Ptolemy's Cluster

17 53 51 -34 47 36; Sco

V = 3.3;  Size 80'


18" (7/21/04): at 92x at least 300 stars are visible in the cluster, though very difficult to count due to the very large size (overfills the 42' field).  The more concentrated part of the cluster spans perhaps 30' and includes a dozen stars of mag 7.5 or brighter in the main body.  This cluster is much larger and brighter (very prominent naked-eye), but it is much more scattered than M6 and so is less impressive.  There are several bright, distinctive strings in the cluster including a N-S string of ~8 stars on the east side of the central region.  An equilateral triangle of mag 6, 7 and 8 stars with sides of 3' is on the NW side of the core of the cluster.  A clump of 5 stars is near the center including two mag 6 and 7 stars.  On the south side of the center of the cluster is an 11' string of 5 mag 5.6 to 7.8 stars oriented SW-NE with the bright mag 5.6 star (HD 16258) on the SW end a distinctive yellow color.


13.1": very bright, very large, impressive but scattered, overfills 52' field.  Open cluster H18 lies 45' SE and globular cluster NGC 6453 40' WNW of center.  Prominent naked-eye cluster in dark sky.  Includes several blue-white and yellowish stars.


8": overfills 40' field, not many faint stars, scattered.


Giovanni Hodierna made the first telescopic observation of M7 = NGC 6475 = Lac II-14 = h3710 in 1654 and resolved the cluster into at least 30 stars.  Edmond Halley made an early observation of M7 in 1677 from St. Helena while cataloging southern stars and Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille "discovered" it again on 15 Jun 1752 from the Cape of Good Hope, as he unaware of Hodierna's earlier observation.  At a declination of -34.7°, M7 culminates only 7° above the horizon from Paris, so Messier's confirmation on 23 May 1764 is impressive.  Halley was credited with the discovery in the NGC.


M7 is often referred to as "Ptolemy's Cluster" as it was possibly included in the Almagest as a "nebula following the sting of Scorpius." (found ~138 BC).  But David Frew states that G Scorpii is the object described as nebulous as Ptolemy may have accidentally precessed the position of G Scorpii in Hipparchus' catalogue.

18" (8/19/09): at 73x appeared as a very large, bright Milky Way patch that was very elongated N-S, ~20'x6'.  A number of faint stars are superimposed, but the unresolved glow really caught my eye first.  Near the NE side is mag 9.4 HD 185916 with a faint companion 28" N.  The 1.2 degree field is stunning with a very large, elongated dark lane (B259) roughly 25' to the east.  A very prominent stream of Milky Way extends through the field in a N-S direction on the east side of B259.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6476 = h3712 on 15 Jul 1836 and simply noted "Nebula.  No description.  It is probably only nebulous portion of the Milky Way."  His RA and Dec are both given as approximate but correspond with a 10th magnitude star at the west edge of a very rich Milky Way field.  RNGC classify the number as nonexistent (Type 7) in the RNGC and ESO only includes a placeholder for the NGC number.

17.5" (8/25/95): extremely difficult, perhaps 10" diameter, round.  Only detected for moments using averted vision and knowing the exact location.  Located 1.6' SE of NGC 6470 = UGC 10974 (misidentified as NGC 6472 in modern catalogues).  A mag 14.5 star is just 30" due north.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6477 = Sw. V-80, along with NGC 6456, 6471 and 6472, on 25 Sept 1886.  His description simply comments on how faint and small this galaxy appeared and notes it as the "6th of 6".  There is nothing close to his position except for a mag 16.5 star, which is perhaps too faint to have been picked up.


Corwin proposes NGC 6477 may be LEDA 2702901.  This galaxy is 15 seconds of RA west and 1.5' south of Swift's position.  But is it too faint?  I found this galaxy was very marginal object in my 17.5" and even challenging in my 24".  So, I'm not convinced at all of this identification and more likely consider it lost.  In any case, the RNGC certainly misidentifies NGC 6472 as NGC 6477.  This error was included in my RNGC Corrections #3.

NGC 6480 = ESO 456-13

17 54 26 -30 27 07; Sco


18" (7/2/11): NGC 6480 is a bright, rich, glowing section of the Milky Way that is sharply cut off by LDN 1795 to the east.  The dust cloud creates a distinctive "V" shaped wedge to the Milky Way glow pointing east with the vertex in the middle of the dark cloud.  There is no termination to the Milky Way star cloud on the west side and no indication of a true cluster.  On the south side of the "V", LDN 1795 cuts off the Milky Way to the south (not as dramatic) creating a "zig-zag" border to the Milky Way.  The view may be more impressive in the 80mm finder at 25x as the much larger field displays the full dark cloud (roughly 30') as well as dark "finders" and "pools" of dust that intrude into the Milky Way on the north side.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6480 = h3713' on 27 Jun 1837 and recorded "An extraordinary B nebulous portion of the Milky Way, on a black ground vL; an angle taken where there is a *12m".  His position corresponds with a mag 12 star at the east edge of a rich Milky Way field outlined on the east side by dark cloud LDN 1795.  His sketch (plate V, figure 2) captures the appearance of this object very well.


NGC 6480 follows h3713 in the CGH catalogue, but was not given a separate designation, though JH used the designation h3713' in the GC and h3713 1/2 in his list of figured nebulae.  Dreyer dropped the prime in the NGC, leaving two objects (NGC 6480 and 6483) equivalent to h3713.


Joseph Turner searched unsuccessfully for this object on two nights in the fall of 1874 as well as Pietro Baracchi on 3 and 4 Oct 188 using the Great Melbourne Telescope.  Perhaps the 14' field of view in the GMT at 234x was too restricted to encompass this object.

He found this galaxy again four weeks later and reported it as new in list V-81 with comment "eeF; S; R; bet. a * and distant triangle."  His second position was quite similar (16 seconds too far west) and he later made a correction (errata to list VIII) "for distant triangle, read: little triangle."  Dreyer combined the two observations into a single NGC designation.  This is one of several cases where Swift included the same object on two lists or even the same list.  Kobold measured an accurate position in 1899, though the correction wasn't published until 1907.


Harold Corwin concludes that Swift rediscovered this galaxy a third time on 11 Jun 1888 and reported in list VII-93 (later IC 1270), "eeeF S R; bet. a * and 3 st. slightly curved; np of 6488; eee diff."  There is nothing at his position, but NGC 6488 follows by 1 1/2 minutes of RA (same Dec) and his description applies with the 3 stars to the north west and a star (more than 1) to the southeast.  Corwin suggests Swift added the comment "np of 6488" when preparing his table for publication based on his earlier position.  So, IC 1270 = NGC 6488.

His position for NGC 6491 is just 10 seconds of time preceding UGC 11008, though there is no "vF * in or just in contact with it".  I'm guessing he saw the sharp stellar nucleus mentioned in my observing notes.


NGC 6493 = Sw. 1-79 is assumed to refer to UGC 11011, a round, face-on Sc situated 3' northeast of NGC 6491.  A mag 14 star less than 1' north may be the "F* v nr".  But Swift's position (and description) for NGC 6493 places it southeast of NGC 6491, contradicting the orientation in the sky.  As a result of this error, the RNGC reversed the identifications of NGC 6491 and NGC 6493, labeling the southwestern of the pair as NGC 6493.  This error is mentioned in my RNGC Corrections #3 and Malcolm Thomson's "Corrections of Some Errors Resulting From Conflicting Catalogue Data".


Another possibility, though, is that Swift observed UGC 11008 on both nights and never saw UGC 11011.  Perhaps he later assumed his observations referred to different objects and added the comments "np of 2" and "sf of 2" when he submitted his list for publication.  In support of this idea, it's reasonable to assume he picked up the brighter, more obvious galaxy on the first night -- that is UGC 110081, certainly not the low surface brightness face-on UGC 11011 to its northeast, which I found "extremely faint" in my 18".  Also, his descriptions are similar enough they could easily apply to the same object.


Philip Keenan found NGC 6491 on a Yerkes Observatory plate.  It was included in a list of new nebulae in the 1935 paper "Studies of Extra-Galactic Nebulae, Part I: Determination of Magnitudes" (ApJ, 82, 62).  He assumed the galaxy to the NE (UGC 11011) was NGC 6493, so labeled NGC 6491 as NGC 6493A and described it as "1.6'x0.7' in PA 39°; Sb."  Gerard de Vaucouleurs repeated the designation NGC 6493A in the 1964 "Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies" (RC1).


With two NGC numbers and two galaxies it seems reasonable to assign the NGC numbers to the two galaxies in order or RA, but I think it's more likely that NGC 6491 = NGC 6493 = UGC 11008.  Hermann Kobold measured an accurate position for NGC 6491 in 1899 (published in 1907).

18" (8/12/10): stunning bright, rich cluster at 175x with several hundred stars visible in the 35' field with a large number of mag 9-11 stars sprinkled throughout the cluster.  Many of the stars are arranged in long chains and loops with a distinctive chain of 5 stars curving NNW to SSE near the center and a longer curve of stars to the southwest.  A string of stars heads NW out of the cluster to mag 6.5 HD 163245 outside the field.  The stars are fairly evenly distributed with the density gradually thinning towards the edges.  Two catalogued double stars are ARA 718 (10.9/12.3 at 5") near the center and ARA 719 (9.8/13.0 at 15") on the SE side.  The Milky Way has a bright background glow just west of the cluster.

Charles Messier discovered M23 = NGC 6494 = h1990 on 20 June 1764.  On 18 Jun 1784 (sweep 230), WH recorded "a cluster of beautifully scattered large stars, nearly of equal magnitudes; (visible in my finder) it extends much farther from the field of the telescope will take in, and in the finder seems to be a nebula of a lengthened form extending to about half a degree."  JH made 3 observations, logging on sweep 269 ( 15 July 1830) "A star 10m in the centre of a beautiful discrete cluster of 60 or 70 stars 10 and 11m and one of 9-10. They run in lines and arches. It is loose and straggling, and the sky around it has a dotted appearance."

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright, low surface brightness globular of 4'-5' diameter.  The globular has a loose concentration class with only a little central condensation.  About a dozen stars were resolved over the face although some of these may be superimposed foreground stars as the cluster is set in a very dense Milky Way star field.  Three of the stars are 12th magnitude with the remainder mag 14-15.  The globular straddles the Scorpius/Corona Australis border, ~25' following mag 4.8 yellow HD 163145.


8" (6/19/82): faint, diffuse, two faint stars at edge.  Located 24' ENE of mag 4.9 SAO 228562 on the Scorpius-Corona Australis border.  This cluster is very far south (low elevation) from Northern California.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6496 = D 460 = h3715 on 28 Jun 1826 and described "a very faint nebula, extended about 2 1/4' in length, oblique to the equator, with a bright point in each extremity; the northern, I think, is a very small star; but the southern of the two, or the one at the southern extremity, is a small nucleus or condensation of the nebulous matter.  This follows 16 Telescopii - Figure 19."  His position is 12.5' northwest of the cluster -- a typical error.  His sketch shows the globular elongated NW-SE, which is probably due to several brighter stars.  Dunlop's position for D 461 is 4 minutes of RA further east and same declination, so this could be a clerical error.


John Herschel noted a possible equivalence with D 460 and D 461 and observed the cluster on two sweeps.  On 1 Jun 1834 he logged "Cluster very rich, irregularly round, including to triangular; vglbM, 4' or 5' diam, with many large and small stars in it. Nebulous."  Then 2 nights later he swept the area again and reported "a distinctly nebulous insulted group, mE, 2' long, 1.5' broad, many stars of considerable size, mixed."

Lewis Swift found NGC 6498 = Sw. I-81 on 26 Sep 1884 and recorded "pF; pS; R; B * nr; F * v[ery] nr; sf of 2."  His position is just 14 seconds of RA west of NGC 6497 = Sw. I-80, which he discovered just 10 days earlier.  UGC 11020 is the only galaxy near his position and his description applies (the "B * nr" is probably the mag 11 star 2.3' east and the "F * v nr" is the 14th mag star off the north side).  Swift perhaps thought these were different nebulae as NGC 6497 was logged as "vvF", compared to "pF" for NGC 6498.  He later added the qualifiers "np of 2" and "sf of 2" as he prepared his first discovery list.  By prior discovery, NGC 6497 should be the primary designation.  Hermann Kobold's position (measured in 1899 but published in 1907) for NGC 6498 matches NGC 6497. See NGC 6491 and 6493, which may be another situation where he recorded the same galaxy on different nights and later assumed they were different.  See Harold Corwin's notes.

He showed the new nebula to his friend Friedrich Winnecke, who was also a student there at the time.  Winnecke, using a 9.6-inch Fraunhofer refractor in 1856 in Berlin, described "..a beautiful object; very bright, slightly brighter in the middle and extraordinarily extended from north preceding to south following, 3-4' long, 50" wide."  Auwers observed NGC 6503 again on 19 Feb 1862 with the Konigsberg heliometer and wrote "bright 3'-4' long, at most 1' wide; gradually brighter in the middle.  There appears to be a faint star in the northern part, which makes the nebula nearly look like a double nebula." Auwers' description was published in his 1862 list of 50 new nebulae.

17.5" (8/3/97): at 100x appears as a weak, circular Milky Way enhancement of approximately two dozen mag 13-14.5 stars over an unresolved glow situated in a rich portion of the Milky Way. At 220x, this group is ~6' diameter, although it is not very well detached so the borders are somewhat arbitrary. As many as 50 stars are now visible as a number of mag 15 and fainter stars are resolved.  Some unresolved background haze is still evident. Also noticed at 100x was Ru 136, a smaller circular glowing spot ~8' WSW of NGC 6506.  At 220x, Ru 136 appeared ~2.5' diameter with about 10 extremely faint stars are resolved over the background glow.  It is situated just NW of two mag 10-11 stars.


John Herschel's description for NGC 6506 probably applies to the entire low power Milky Way field and this object is listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Ernst Hartwig discovered NGC 6508 = Sw. I-82 on 19 Sep 1883 with the 18-inch refractor at the Strasbourg Observatory and measured an accurate position (AN 2544).  He found this galaxy while searching for "Comet Swift" (later NGC 6654), which Swift had announced on 14 Sep as a new comet.  Swift responded on 20 Oct (AN 2561) that Hartwig's nebula was new, though he independently discovered on 1 Oct.  He was probably both upset with himself and embarrassed he was deceived by the galaxy, adding the disparaging comments, "It would appear from his (Hartwig's) silence that he missed another about 4 minutes east and 1° 20' north, which I found Oct 3 [1883]."


Swift included NGC 6508 in his first list with a discovery date of 17 Jun 1884 and description "vF; S; forms with 3 stars a square."  His position was 40 seconds of RA too far east, but the description of the nearby stars, which lie to the north, clinches the identification.  Dreyer credited Swift with the discovery in the NGC, though Hartwig made the first observation.

His position is 21 seconds of RA west of NGC 6511 = UGC 11051, the only reasonably bright galaxy near his position and his description applies.  Swift discovered this galaxy earlier on 9 Oct 1884.  His first position was 19 seconds of RA too large, so perhaps he felt these were different objects.  In any case, NGC 6510 = NGC 6511 with NGC 6511 the primary designation (due to earlier discovery).  Dreyer himself added the query "? = last one" in the summary description for NGC 6511.  Bigourdan measured a position for NGC 6510 on 6 Oct 1890 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes), but his position is well off and probably refers to a faint star.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6511 = Sw. I-83 on 9 Oct 1884 and recorded "F; pL; BM; 2 nearest of 3 st in a curve point to it."  His position is 19 seconds of RA east of UGC 11051 but his description applies to three stars to the south.  Swift probably found this galaxy again on 30 May 1886, entered it in his 4th list as #60 (later NGC 6510).  His position in list IV was 21 seconds of RA too far west.  So, NGC 6510 is likely NGC 6511.  Bigourdan measured an accurate RA on 6 Oct 1890 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

18" (8/12/10): the emission component of M20 was sketched and observed carefully at 175x.  At the intersection of the dark lanes is the multiple central star HN 40 with a mag 7.6/10.4 pair at 6" and a tight mag 8.7/10.5 pair at 2.3", with the two pairs are separated by 11".  Four lanes (B85) emanate from the bright central hub.  A narrow lane starts NW of the multiple star and heads 2.5' due N, where it stops at a mag 10 star.  Near the base of this lane another branch heads west to the edge of the nebula.  Another lane heads SSE for ~2.5', tapering at the end.  A prominent lane shoots 3.5' NE and has a few short branches, including one just NE of the central stars.  This lane is bordered by a couple of mag 10.5-11 stars on its south edge.  There is an extension at the NE end that bends to the north and exits the main nebulosity and merging with a dusty region just SE the reflection component to the north.  A mag 9.4 star is at the north edge of the main emission component.  The blue reflection component surrounds mag 7.3 HD 164514 and extends ~6' with an irregular structure.


13.1" (7/16/82): bright, fairly large, contains three inky black dark lanes (B85) with sharp edges.  Structure is visible along the dark lanes and in the center.  The prominent central star is a quadruple (4th star difficult) consisting of a mag 7.6/10.4 pair at 6" and a mag 8.7/10.5 pair at 2.3", the brighter stars separated by 11".  The NW lane is wider and fainter than the other two lanes.  A round, bluish reflection nebula is separated, but very close north.  The view improves using a UHC filter.


8" (7/16/82): the famous rift structure is fairly prominent with a triple star at the center.  The NW rift is more subdued.  An easily visible reflection nebula is close north.


15x50 IS binoculars: visible as a small, faint glow surrounding a the central "star".


Charles Messier discovered M20 = NGC 6514 = H IV-41 = H V-10/11/12 = h1991 = h3718 on 5 June 1764 and noted a cluster of stars.  William Herschel first observed M20 on 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236) and recorded, "Three nebulae, but they seem to join faintly together, forming a kind of triangle; in the middle of which is less nebulous, or perhaps free from nebulosity is a double star of the 2nd or 3rd class.  As I intended to revisit this place very soon I passed on, but think more very faint nebulosities are following."  He assigned it three catalogue numbers, V 10, V 11 and V 12.  His reference star was misidentified, though (4 Sgr = SAO 186061 instead of 5 Sgr = SAO 186074), so his position is incorrect.  William Herschel also reobserved the Trifid on 26 May 1786 (sweep 566) and recorded IV-41 using a different reference star as "a double star with extensive nebulosity, of different intensity; about the double star is a black opening, resembling the nebula in Orion, on a small scale."  John Herschel combined these numbers into a single GC entry (4355).  Harold Corwin notes he made the same error with NGC 6533.


John Herschel first used the name "Trifid" to describe M20 in the Slough Catalogue (1 Jul 1826): "vL; trifid, three nebulae with a vacuity in the midst, in which is centrally situated the double star Sh 379, neb = 7' in extent.  A most remarkable object." Interestingly neither William or John referred to this object as M20, possibly because of positional confusion or because Messier called it a "star cluster".  The equivalence was given in the GC 4355.


In John Herschel's Cape Observations (1847) and "Outlines of Astronomy" (1849) he described "One of the them [several nebulae in Sagittarius] is singularly trifid, consisting of three bright and irregularly formed nebulous masses, graduating away insensibly externally, but coming up to a great intensity of light at their interior edges, where they enclose and surround a sort of three-forked rift, or vacant area, abruptly and uncouthly crooked, and quite void of nebulous light.  A bright triple star is situated precisely on the edge of one of these nebulous masses just where the interior vacancy forks out two channels.  A fourth nebulous mass spreads like a fan or downy plume from a star at a little distance from the triple nebula."

17.5" (6/6/86): extremely bright, detailed nebulosity that nearly fills a 50' field.  Extensive fainter nebulosity fills the region to the north and a thin extension is to the east.  Cut by a large high contrast dark lane ("Lagoon") oriented SW-NE.  The brightest luminary within the nebula is 9 Sagittarii (V = 6.0), situated to the west of the dark lane with a mag 7 companion 3' NNE.  A very bright 30" nebulous knot ("Hourglass Nebula", ionized by O7 star Herschel 36) is situated 3' SW of 9 Sagittarii.  NGC 6530, a bright open cluster, is on the east side of the dark lane.  Barnard 89 is a fairly well-defined roundish dark nebula ~6' following NGC 6530.  The Lagoon is a prominent naked-eye object in dark sky.  See observing notes for NGC 6530 and IC 1271.  The Trifid Nebula (M20) lies 85' NNW.


Giovanni Hodierna discovered NGC 6530, the associated cluster within M8 = Lac III-13 = h3722.  He catalogued it as II. 6 in his 1654 "De Admirandis Coeli Caracteribus". John Flamsteed called it a "nebula" around 1680 but Guillaume Le Gentil was perhaps the first to recognize (telescopically) the mix of nebulosity and stars around 1747.  Using a small 18- to 20-foot focal length refractor, he noted "a small nebulosity like the tail of a comet with numerous stars."  His position was off, though, by more the one degree.


Earlier observers appear to have thought the naked-eye glow resolved into stars in a telescope.  When Philippe de Cheseaux reviewed Flamsteed's observation in 1745-46 he concluded the object appeared as a "truly nebulous" star naked-eye but as a star cluster through a telescope.  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille catalogued M8 as a nebulous star (III. 13), based on his observation at the Cape in 1751-52, though with a 1/2-inch telescope he couldn't resolve the object.  Messier's 1764 observation mentioned "a cluster of stars that appears to be a nebula when observed with a simple three-foot refractor; with an excellent instrument, however, one sees only a large number of faint stars.  Near this cluster there is a fairly bright star [9 Sgr], which is surrounded by a very faint glow."


William Herschel observed M8 on 22 May 1784 (sweep 223) and logged "large, extended, pretty bright, broad. The nebulosity of the milky kind, there are some pB stars in it, but they seem to have no connection with it, being of very different sizes [magnitudes] and colours and resembling the other stars that are everywhere scattered about in this neighborhood. This is probably the star surrounded with nebulosity mentioned by Messier. There is indeed one of the stars which are in the nebula that is somewhat larger [brighter] than the rest and may be the only one he saw."  John Herschel produced a beautiful drawing of the nebula with carefully positioned stars (Plate I, fig 1), though Wilhelm Tempel questioned it as differing significantly from his own.


Stephen O'Meara states, "The word "Lagoon" was probably first used in association with M8 by Agnes M. Clerke in her 1890 wor entitled The System of the Stars."

William Herschel discovered NGC 6526 = H V-9 on 22 May 1784 (sweep 223) and recorded "large, extended, broad; its nebulosity is of the milky kind, but fainter and more uniform, than the preceding [M8]; otherwise in situation and shape, it resembles it pretty much.  It may be taken into the field with the preceding [M8]."  Dreyer comments, in his 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that the "NPD in GC and NGC is 1 degree too small; the error dates from C.H.'s Zone Catalogue.  The nebulosity is just following M8 and is = IC 1271 (Swift, VIII)."  The "corrected" NGC position is then 18 04 15 -24 27.5 (2000) and places it within the main M8 complex.


Corwin suggests (e-mail on 6/1/96) that NGC 6526 applies to the part of the Lagoon following the dust lane which swings up to include the star cluster NGC 6530.  Swift's IC 1271 (VIII) apparently applies to a nebulous knot near the end of the "branch" heading east of the main complex, so is not equal to NGC 6526 as Dreyer stated.


RNGC places NGC 6526 at 18 04.8 -23 40 (2000) which corresponds with the center of the large, irregular nebulosity plotted on the Uranometria 2000 about 45' NNE of M8.  Sky Catalogue 2000 gives a position of 18 02.6 -23 35, repeated in Sinnott's NGC 2000.0.

ESO classifies this object as a concentration of stars and RNGC calls it nonexistent.  Harold Corwin was unable to find a candidate for NGC 6529 (either at the published position or JH's re-reduced position), so it is classified here as "Not Found".

V = 4.6;  Size 15'


17.5" (7/8/94): bright scattered group of 40-50 stars at the east edge of M8 just following the edge of the dark "Lagoon" lane which runs SW-NE.  The group forms a rough triangular outline 10'x6' oriented N-S with the longest base along the east side running N-S.  The cluster is encased in the fairly bright eastern portion of the M8 nebulosity that passes directly through most of the cluster.


8": 30 stars mag 7-13 in a 10' diameter.  Bright, moderately large.  Located on the east edge of M8!


Giovanni Hodierna discovered NGC 6530 = h3725, the cluster within M8, around 1654 and reported it in his catalog "De Admirandis Coeli Caracteribus".  Messier described "a cluster of stars that appears to be a nebula when observed with a simple three-foot refractor; with an excellent instrument, however, one sees only a large number of faint stars.  Near this cluster there is a fairly bright star [9 Sgr], which is surrounded by a very faint glow."  John Herschel recorded (sweep 474) "a B, p Rich, irreg R cl; place that of a double * in the following part of the cluster, which is itself involved in the great nebula M8."

18" (8/12/10): In the center of the cluster is the brightest member; mag 7.2 HD 164863.  This star forms a 30" pair (South 698) with mag 8.7 HD 313693. A third bright star, mag 8.8 HD 164883 lies 1.2' NE of the brightest star and extending in a short line NE are two additional mag 10 and 11 stars.  Just north of this central clump is a beautiful ring of a dozen stars mag 9.5-12 stars.  ARA 1841, a pair of 12.4/12.7 stars at 8" lies 1.5' WNW of South 698.  An incomplete larger ring of stars surrounds the entire group and includes ARA 1841.  A total of roughly 50 stars are within 7'.


17.5" (8/10/91): M21 consists of roughly 50 stars in a 5' diameter.  Very bright, fairly small although outliers greatly increase the diameter.  Includes a wide double star south 698 = 7.9/8.8 at 30".  Just north of these stars is a remarkably symmetric ring consisting of a mag 9.5 star and ten mag 12-13 stars.  A close mag 14/14 double star is on the west side of the bright double star.  Just west is a 10' string of mag 8/9 stars oriented NW-SE including two double stars.  M20 lies 45' SW.  Easily visible in 15x50 IS binoculars as a small knot.


Charles Messier discovered M21 = NGC 6531 = h1993 on 5 Jun 1764.  On 26 May 1786 (sweep 556), WH noted "a rich cluster of large stars."  On 28 Jul 1830, JH recorded "A tolerably rich, sc, coarse cl; one star 9m, the rest 10....12."  His single position was 6' too far east.

Edward Swift, the 15 year-old son of Lewis, discovered NGC 6532 = Sw. V-83 on 19 Sep 1886.  Lewis recorded "eeF; pS; R; e diff.; in a small vacancy; 3 F stars in line point to it."  The position is 25 sec of RA preceding UGC 11085, the only nearby galaxy.  His comment "3 F stars in line point to it" probably applies to a string of stars to the west. Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 6 Sep 1888 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

See observing notes for NGC 6523 = M8.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6533 = H V-13 on 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236) and recorded "extensive milky nebulosity divided into two parts, the most northern part is the strongest and of more than 15' extent; the southern one is followed by a parcel of stars."  This description appears to describe M8, but using the reference star 5 Sgr, WH's position falls on a empty portion of the sky ~30' south-southeast of M8.


Harold Corwin found (personal email on 1 Jun 1996) that the same reference star was used by WH in his observation of V10, V11, V12  = M20.  His offset again points 30' SSE of M20 indicating an error in the offset star which should be 4 Sgr = SAO 186061.  Once this correction is made, his position points to the center of M8.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for the full story.

24" (9/1/16): fairly faint, small, round, 15" diameter, occasional faint stellar nucleus.  Located just 48" of a mag 10.4 star.  A 1' pair of mag 10/11 stars is 3.5' NE.  Forms a close pair with LEDA 2666218 1.2' S.  The companion is faint, small, round, 15" diameter, low even surface brightness.


CGCG 322-010 lies 11' NW.  At 220x it appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated ~N-S, 15"x10".  Contains a faint stellar nucleus surrounded by a faint halo.  A mag 11.8 star is 2' S, a mag 14 star is 2' ESE and a mag 13.5 star is 2' NE.  CGCG 322-010 fits Swift's published description much better than CGCG 322-022, but is a poorer match in position.


17.5" (8/4/94): very faint, extremely small, round.  Located 50" S of a mag 10 star.  With direct vision appears stellar, about mag 15.  With averted vision a very small halo is visible, perhaps 15" diameter.  Located 22' NW of mag 7.7 SAO 17717.  On the POSS this galaxy is almost stellar with a very faint ring.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6534 = Sw. IV-63 on 28 Jun 1886 and recorded "eeF; pS; R; in center of a semi-circle of 4 stars."  There is nothing at his position, but 70 seconds of RA west and 1.2' south is CGCG 322-022 = PGC 61126, which the RNGC, CGCG and PGC identify as NGC 6534.  But this galaxy doesn't fit Swift's description as there is no semi-circle of 4 stars surrounding the galaxy.  Furthermore, a mag 10 star is less than 1' north and Swift would have likely mentioned it.  Harold Corwin agrees this identification is very uncertain due to the discrepancy with the description and mentions CGCG 322-020 as another candidate.  It fits Swift's description (the semicircle is immediately east), but the positional match is poor.

V = 10.6;  Size 3.6';  Surf Br = 1.1


24" (7/30/16): at 500x; moderately bright and large, roundish, ~3' diameter, fairly weak concentration with a slightly brighter core. A mag 13 star is on the southwest side of the halo, two mag 13.5 stars on the west side and another near the northwest edge.  A half-dozen stars additional stars are resolved in the halo with a few additional around the edges of the halo.  A number more scintillate in and out of view, emerging for brief moments in better seeing, ~20-25 total seen in the halo.  The core region includes another half-dozen stars with one standing out more prominently.


18" (8/23/03): at 435x, appears fairly faint, ~3' diameter with an irregular outline, and just a weak concentration.  A trio of mag 13-13.5 stars is easily resolved on the west edge and the middle star has two close, mag 14.5 and 15.5 companions.  With careful viewing about a dozen extremely faint stars sparkle over the central glow, often popping in out of averted vision.  At 538x, the cluster barely breaks up into a swarm of extremely faint stars in steady moments.


17.5" (8/10/91): moderately bright, roughly circular, 3' diameter.  Three mag 13 stars and a mag 14 star are almost on a line oriented N-S on the west edge.  Very mottled and granular appearance with an irregular outline.  Can just steadily resolve a few very faint stars and another half a dozen extremely faint stars pop in and out of view over the core.  Located within a rich star field.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6535 = Au 38 on 24 Aug 1780 with his 6.2-inch reflector (used to discover Uranus) during his initial inspection of Flamsteed stars.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, who uncovered this observation ("a nebula with stars") in his Herschel research, this was the first nebula he discovered!  As a result NGC 7009 = Saturn Nebula, found on 7 Sep 1782 with the same reflector, was his second discovery.  The same night he also observed M8 ("a Nebula not marked in the map full of stars in via Lactea"), before being aware of Messier's catalogue.


John Russell Hind independently discovered NGC 6535 on 26 Apr 1852 (MN, 12, 208) with a 7-inch Dolland refractor at George Bishop's private observatory in London and recorded "a nebulous object which does not occur in any of the Catalogues of Nebulae hitherto consulted.  It is very small and rather faint, perhaps 1' in diameter and is preceded a few seconds by a very minute hazy-looking star."  Hind is credited with the discovery in the NGC. Auwers observed it with the 6-inch Heliometer at Königsberg Observatory and reported "pF, round, 2' diameter, gradually very slightly bM."


Based on photographs with the 30" reflector in 1914-16 at the Helwan Observatory, NGC 6535 was reported as a "small loose cluster of a few bright stars. No nebulosity."

24" (7/11/18): at 225x; very small disc with a warm or ruddy color.  Excellent view at 375x; very small, slightly elongated, ~6" diameter.  The disc has a very high surface brightness and appears to be surrounded by a very faint thin shell.  The PN forms an obtuse isosceles triangle with a mag 11.6 star 1.5' W and a mag 12.6 star 2.4' N.


17.5" (8/17/01): picked up at 220x as a fuzzy mag 12 "star" forming the eastern vertex of an obtuse, isosceles triangle with two similar stars 1.5' W and 2.4' NW.  Excellent view at 380x and 500x.  Clearly nonstellar at the higher powers, ~5" diameter with a bluish color and occasionally a slightly brighter center.

Located 7' SW of mag 6.8 SAO 161056 and forms the east vertex of an obtuse triangle with two mag 12 stars 1.5' WNW and 2.4' NW.


Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6537 on 15 Jul 1882 with the 15-inch refractor at the Harvard College Observatory.  NGC 6565 was the 5th of 17 planetaries he found using a direct-vision spectroscope attached to the large refractor.  He announced the discovery of the first dozen in Sidereal Messenger, Oct 1882 (no descriptions) and in Astronomische Nachrichten 2454, he noted it as "small and bright".  His position in Sidereal Messenger was accurate.


Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6537 as "a minute disk 5" in diameter, just distinguishable from a star.  Round, with clear-cut edges; a slightly condensation at center is suspected, and a very faint ansa in p.a. 25".  The huge hourglass-shapes structure visible in deep images that surrounds the central part was missed in the Lick photographs.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6538 = Sw. IV-62 on 30 May 1886 and recorded "eF; vS; lE; between 2 eF stars."  His position is 25 seconds of RA west and 44" south of UGC 11062 (2' separation) and his description applies (the stars are northwest and southeast). Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 10 Oct 1890.


Swift apparently made the initial discovery several years earlier.  On 11 Sep 1883 Swift announced finding a supposed comet (see NGC 6654 for the story).  While searching for the comet, Ernst Hartwig discovered NGC 6508 and two other astronomers (Palisa and Lamp) found NGC 6654 and thought it was new.  Swift was apparently upset and probably embarrassed with being deceived and tartly replied (AN 107, p273), "It would appear from his (Hartwig's) silence that he missed another about 4 minutes east and 1° 20' north, which I found Oct 3 [1883]."  This offset matches NGC 6538, but Swift didn't report it in his discovery lists, until it was rediscovered on 30 May 1886.

24" (7/30/16): at 260x; fairly faint, moderately large, round, ~3' diameter, very weak concentration.  A brighter mag 12.8 star is just off the northwest edge and a mag 13.5 star is off the southwest edge. The cluster was very lively at 432x and several faint to extremely faint stars were resolved around the edges of the halo including a few easy ones just off the west side.  Several very faint to extremely faint stars scintillate over the core and main portion of the halo, popping in and out of view with the seeing, though only a couple of these were consistently visible.


18" (7/19/04): at 225x appears fairly faint, moderately large, round, weakly concentration.  The diameter is ~3.5' diameter with averted vision.  A few mag 15-15.5 stars are along the west edge of the halo with some brighter mag 13 stars off to the west and NW.  At 435x, 3 or 4 mag 15 stars are grouped near the west edge of the halo and a single mag 15.5-16 star is near the center.  The edges appear ragged at this magnification.


18" (8/23/03): at 323x appears fairly faint, round, pretty diffuse with only a broad, fairly weak concentration.  A mag 12.5 star is off the NW side and a few mag 13 stars are off the SW edge and further off the SE side.  A couple of mag 15 stars are resolved between the two brighter stars on the west side. At 435x, the surface brightness is quite mottled and seems on the verge of resolution but only one or two extremely faint stellar sparkles are intermittently visible.


17.5" (8/10/91): fairly faint, moderately large, 3' diameter, round, diffuse, broad weak concentration.  A number of stars are very near including a mag 12.5 star off the NW edge and a fainter mag 13.5 star off the SE edge.  In addition, an extremely faint 15th mag star is resolved near the NW edge and a mag 15 star is visible near the center but no other resolution was evident.


8" (6/22/81): faint, moderately large, very diffuse, no resolution.  This globular straddles the Serpens/Oph border, 44' NE of Tau Ophiuchi, an excellent 1.5" double star.


Theodor Johann Christian Brorsen discovered NGC 6539 = Au 39 in 1856 (probably Sept) at the Senftenberg Observatory in the present-day Czech Republic, probably using a 9.4-cm comet-seeker.  Arthur Auwers observed this globular on 10 Oct 1860 with the Konigsberg 6-inch refractor and reported (in the notes to his 1862 list of new nebulae) that it "looked faint, but pretty well at 65x; it appears to be a faint star group of about 3' diameter, centrally surrounded by numerous stars 12m." (translation by Wolfgang Steinicke).  NGC 6539 is one of the brighter southern objects that John Herschel missed.

18" (7/11/07): this very unusual globular is buried within a small asterism and requires careful viewing.  At 325x a very distinctive 1.5' string or shallow arc of stars is oriented E-W and contains 6 stars (these are possible cluster members).  Within this shallow arc is a 20" knot just east of the midpoint and this knot is probably the core of the globular.  The entire string is superimposed on a rich Milky Way background so it was very difficult to determine a diameter for the outer halo.


17.5" (7/10/99): this interesting globular is located nearly midway along a short 1.5' E-W arc of a half dozen or so mag 13-14 stars that are bowed out to the north.  The globular is a faint, round, 40" glow, embedded just inside the center of this string which extends beyond the globular to the west and east.  At 100x, this string, along with the haze of the cluster creates the impression the globular is quite elongated.


13.1" (9/3/83): very faint, small, rich spot, slightly elongated E-W, mottled but no resolved.  Also a group of six faint stars in an arc to the SE.  Dark nebula B86 lies 41' W.


Originally listed as an open cluster, this object was reclassified as a globular in 1987 by Djorgovski.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6540 = H II-198 on 24 May 1784 (end of sweep 224) and recorded "pF, crookedly extended easily resolvable nebula; or rather a cluster of very close stars; not large."


Guillaume Bigourdan's description mentions a size of 1.5' x 25", elongated E-W, stars mag 13 and fainter containing possible "nebulous material".  So, Bigourdan was clearly describing the entire string of stars.

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): the view was spectacular at 200x as NGC 6541 was well concentrated with a blazing core and a large halo extending to at least 8'.  Roughly 200 stars were resolved, mostly in the halo but even close to the center of the core.  Includes a few brighter mag 10.5-11 stars are in the halo on the NE and S side.


11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): excellent view at 127x!  Well concentrated to a small, intense 1.5' core.  The halo extended to roughly 8' and was well-resolved into perhaps 100 stars.  A brighter star is at the northeast side of the halo and a couple of brighter stars are at the S and SW edge of the cluster.  Prominent in 10x30 IS binoculars.


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this beautiful globular is set in a rich star field and is strongly compressed with a blazing core.  At 171x, the halo is ~8' and highly resolved into a couple of hundred stars mag 12 and fainter.  A few brighter stars (field?) are mixed in, including mag 11 stars on the east and southwest side of the halo.  The stars are densely packed towards the core - another southern showpiece globular!


8" (7/16/82): bright, fairly small, well concentrated to bright core.  Mottled halo but no resolution.  Located 20' SE of a mag 5 star (h 5014 = 5.8/5.8 at 1.8").  Very far south (low elevation) for viewing from Northern California.


Niccolo Cacciatore, an assistant to Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo, discovered NGC 6541 = D 473 = h 3726 on 19 Mar 1826, while searching for Comet C/1825 N1 (Pons) with a small refractor.  James Dunlop independently discovered this globular a few months later on 3 Jul 1826 and described "a very bright round highly condensed nebula, about 3' diameter. I can resolve a considerable portion round the margin, but the compression is so great near the centre, that it would require a very high power, as well as light, to separate the stars; the stars are rather dusky."  He notes 5 observations were made and his position is 6' northwest of the center.  John Herschel's first observation was on 1 Jun 1834 (h3726) and he reported "globular, B, R, e comp, v Fine; diameter of most comp part = 11 seconds of time in RA; stars 15..16m. The scattered stars extend to three times the diameter and die away very gradually."  He references D 473 in the Cape catalogue but wasn't aware of Cacciatore's earlier observation.

V = 8.1;  Size 22"x19"


48" (4/1/11): the extremely bright inner section [22"x19"] of the Cat's Eye was a vivid green color at 375x. But besides the bright central star I didn't take notes on the interior structure.  A fairly faint (middle) halo was easily visible, extending ~1.4' diameter and dramatically increased the generally observed size.  This halo had a well-defined periphery and was slightly elongated N-S or the border on the east and west sides were very slightly flattened.  A very faint star is near the west edge.


Surrounding the middle shell is a much larger and fainter outer halo that extends ~5' in diameter.  IC 4677 appeared as a prominent, triangular or wedge-shaped knot with the vertex pointing east, situated 1.8' due west of center near the edge of this outer halo. It appeared much larger than previously seen, ~50"x30", and brighter along a well-defined, straight southern edge.  The north side is brightest near the east end at the vertex.  A 15th magnitude star lies 45" NE and a mag 9.8 star is 1.2' NW.  A second fainter knot in the outer halo is located 2.6' ESE of center, just 30" N of a mag 14.5 star.  This knot was only 15"-20" in size and had a low surface brightness.


18" (7/21/04): at 435x, it was fairly clear that there were two shells in the main body of different sizes and orientations creating a complex overlapping appearance. Surrounding the high surface brightness main body was a thin, very faint outer envelope (inner portion of the outer envelope). The central star was visible continuously.


IC 4677 was easily visible at 160x using a UHC filter as a slightly elongated, low surface brightness glow 1.7' W of center of NGC 6543 and 1.5' SE of a mag 11 star which lies 2.7' WNW of NGC 6543.  This shock-excited knot in the outer halo was elongated 3:2 SW-NE, roughly 20"x13".  At 225x it was barely visible unfiltered, but could be held continuously at this power adding a UHC filter.


18" (6/21/03): remarkable view at 538x.  The central star shone steadily in the center of what appeared to be two superimposed shells, offset in orientation by ~90 degrees.  Interior filamentary or arc-like structure was highly suspected.


17.5" (6/11/88): viewed at 280x and 412x; the Cat's Eye nebula appears very bright, fairly small, oval SW-NE, blue-green color.  Appears darker (annular) surrounding the mag 11 central star.  The prominent visual portion is surrounded by a very faint oval outer envelope (386") which was not seen but includes the bright irregular knot IC 4677 1.7' W of center.  NGC 6552 is located 10' following.


IC 4677 was suspected at 220x without filtration close to a mag 15 star located 1' W of the planetary.  Using a UHC filter, IC 4677 was clearly visible with averted vision as a very faint elongated patch, ~25"x15" oriented SW-NE.  Requires averted for a good view but could hold steadily almost continuously.  It was also visible at 140x with an OIII filter and 280x with the UHC, but 220x provided the best view.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6543 = H IV-37 on 15 Feb 1786 (sweep 523) and recorded "vB, about 35" diameter. A planetary disk, but very ill defined edge; the center of it is rather more luminous than the rest. With long attention a very bright, well defined, round center becomes visible.  This seems to be a nebula that connects my former planetary ones with two other sorts; viz with those that are very bright in the middle and suddenly grow more diluted; and with those that have a bright central star, or nucleus and a milky chevelure."


In 1790, Lalande included this object as a 9th magnitude "star" (LL 38303 in his major star catalogue.  Giuseppe Bianchi independently rediscovered it on 16 Jun 1839 and announced the discovery an Astronomische Nachrichten letter, apparently unaware of WH's prior discovery (there were many similar cases).  Surprisingly, NGC 6543 does not appear in John Herschel's Slough catalogue, which was more accessible and easier to check than WH's catalogues.


Sir William Huggins examined NGC 6543 with a spectroscope on 29 Aug 1864 (the same night he viewed NGC 6572, 6828, 6818, 7009, 6720, 7662, 6853).  He wrote "On the evening of the 29th of August, 1864, I directed the telescope for the first time to a planetary nebula in Draco [NGC 6543]. The reader may now be able to picture to himself to some extent the feeling of excited suspense, mingled with a degree of awe, with which, after a few moments of hesitation, I put my eye to the spectroscope. Was I not about to look into a secret place of creation? I looked into the spectroscope. No spectrum such as I expected ! A single bright line only!"  At first, I suspected some displacement of the prism, and that I was looking at a reflection of the illuminated slit from one of its faces. This thought was scarcely more than momentary; then the true interpretation flashed upon me. The light of the nebula was monochromatic, and so, unlike any other light I had as yet subjected to prismatic examination, could not be extended out to form a complete spectrum." Based on subsequent observations, Huggins showed nebulae had bright [OIII] emission lines, unlike the broad spectrum expected of unresolved stars.  He concluded these objects were enormous masses of hot luminous gas or vapour which would never be resolved into stars.


The 1888 paper "Observations of Nebulae at the Lick Observatory" (1888MNRAS..48..388H) included a schematic labeled "Helical Nebula in Draco (Holden)" showing two overlapping ellipses or coils, along with a detailed sketch and description of the nebula.  Heber Curtis wrote "We have, therefore, ventured to designate this object as a helical nebula - the first of its class - because its brighter portions unquestionably appear to the eye in a helical and not simply in a spiral form; and also because it seems to us at least probable that the real disposition of the brighter parts in space may be in the form of a helix."  Generally, the nickname "Cat's Eye Nebula" is used today.


E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4677, a shock-excited knot in the outer halo of NGC 6543, on 24 Apr 1900 with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor.  See Harold Corwin's notes.

Édouard Stephan found NGC 6550 = St XII-87 on 19 Jul 1882.  His micrometric position is a perfect match with UGC 1111.  Albert Marth discovered this galaxy earlier on 27 Jul 1864 and it was catalogued as m 361 = GC 5892 = NGC 6549. Stephan, though, in the notes to list XII, incorrectly stated that XII-87 was distinct from NGC 6548 and 6549.  Whatever Stephan felt was NGC 6549, it is clear that NGC 6550 = NGC 6549.


Lewis Swift must have examined the field and realized there were only two galaxies here.  In his notes to his large discovery list XI, he mentions "NGC 6550 = H III 555 [NGC 6548].  6550 must be struck out."  In the IC 2 notes, Dreyer repeated that NGC 6550 is identical to NGC 6548 (from Swift), instead of NGC 6549.  This error is repeated in UGC, CGCG, NGC 2000.0 and Deep Sky Field Guide (to the Uranometria Sky Atlas).  This error is mentioned in Malcolm Thomson's unpublished "Catalogue Corrections".

Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 6551= LM 1-230 on 7 Jul 1885 and noted "vF, vS, R, rr."  His rough position (nearest minute of RA) is just 17 seconds west of ESO 456-**60, an asterism of a half-dozen stars within 4'.  Herbert Howe, probably found this asterism with his 20-inch at Denver around the turn of the century and remarked "simply a few stars of mag 13."  ESO (Lauberts) calls it a "Concentration of stars in Milky Way."


But Harold Corwin, who examined Leavenworth's sketch, notes that it shows a globular cluster-like object between two stars and does not match this asterism.  So, the group of scattered stars near his position seen by Howe is very unlikely.  Corwin suggests NGC 6528 or perhaps NGC 6522 as candidates, though the nearby stars are not a good match with the sketch.

A mag 11.8 star is on the northwest side of the halo and fainter stars are on the northeast side (pair) and southwest side, bounding the cluster into a somewhat rectangular appearance.  At 432x, the cluster was very lively or mottled with a couple of additional resolved stars and others just on the verge of resolution.  A few additional stars were resolved around the edges of the halo.

18" (9/3/05): at 115x appears as a large, scattered group of ~100 stars in a 25' x10' region.  Most of the brighter stars form a triangular outline with a 15' string of stars oriented NW to SE forming the western leg of the triangle being most evident.  A number of faint stars pepper the interior at 225x, though at this power the group filled the field and was not recognizable at all.  This appears to be a random Milky Way asterism although the triangular outline is somewhat detached in the field at low power.  Contains a number of mag 10.5-11.5 star although there is no single brighter star.  A fairly small triangle of stars including a mag 11 pair at 27" is off the west side.


17.5" (8/12/01): large, very scattered, elongated group at 100x.  Roughly three dozen stars are visible in an arbitrary 20'x6' region, extended NW-SE.  A close quadruple is at the west side of the NW end.  There are no rich concentrations and the group looks just like an random asterism.  At 220x, ~50 stars are seen with some faint clumps visible but as the group now fills the field I would not have noticed it at all at this power.  The outline is easier to trace along the western flank and around the NW end.  An evenly matched mag 12 pair is off the west side but is not within the main group.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6554 = h1995 on 14 Jul 1830 and recorded "A v coarse and scattered but p rich cluster of L and S stars.  Has several double stars in it." A 24" pair of mag 10/12 stars just 1' north of JH's position in a Milky Way field.  Karl Reinmuth reported "many st in milky way, no distinct Cl" and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

The position, though, was easy to identify as an as a large triangle (sides ~12') with four mag 7-8 stars (including HD 165873, 165708, 165787) is off the southwest side.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6556 = h3732 on 15 Jul 1836 and recorded "Cl VI. An oval patch comprised within limits of the field, barely resolvable into infinitely minute points, but which, without attention, appears as a great nebula 15' l; 12' br; hardly bM."  In his survey of NGC objects with the 20-inch refractor at Denver, Herbert Howe wrote "I see nothing in the entire region except thousands of the minutest stars."

24" (7/11/18): at 200x and NPB filter; bright, moderately large, slightly elongated SW-NE, ~50" diameter, crisp-edged, irregular surface brightness, weakly annular, resides in a rich star field.  At 375x the elongation was more evident as well as a noticeably irregular surface brightness with slightly darker interior areas.  A faint star is at the SSW edge and one or two extremely faint stars seemed to be superimposed.


18" (7/16/07): at 323x appears as a fairly bright, sharply defined disc, slightly elongated SW-NE and perhaps 48"x40".  The disc exhibits a subtle irregularity in surface brightness but there was no evident annularity.  A couple of extremely faint stars occasionally sparkled over the disc, though it was difficult to tell if one was situated right at the center.


17.5" (6/28/00): at 280x this moderately bright PN appears elongated 5:4 SW-NE, ~50"x40".  The surface brightness is pretty smooth and no central star was visible.  A UHC filter provides a moderate contrast gain.  Set is a rich star field.


13" (8/17/85): observation at 166x and 220x: fairly faint, moderately large, slightly elongated ~N-S, no annularity.  Prominent using UHC filter, moderate surface brightness.  Located in a rich star field 15' ESE of mag 6.2 SAO 209817.


8" (7/16/82): faint, elongated N-S, fairly small.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6563 = h3734 = D 606? on 7 Jun 1837 and recorded "a L, F, oval, planetary nebula, about 60" long, 50" broad, or 55"; considerably hazy, or rather indistinctly terminated at the borders, but not bM; a star 6-7m precedes it, just 1 diameter of the field and nearly in the parallel."


James Dunlop possibly discovered this planetary on 3 Sep 1826 and reported a "faint nebula, about 1 1/4' long and 30" or 40" broad, with a considerable brightness near each end and faint in the middle, resembling two small nebulae joined." His position (single observation) is 36' northeast of NGC 6563.  This is a fairly large error, even for Dunlop, but the size is reasonably close.


Joseph Turner sketched the planetary on 30 Jul 1877 with the Great Melbourne Telescope as an oval and "a close double star just touches its south edge."


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6565 as "a faint oval 50"x37" in p.a. 50°; stronger regions at the ends of the minor axis give it an indistinct ring or shell effect; it is considerably fainter along, and at the ends of the major axis."

17.5" (8/17/01): picked up at 100x as fuzzy mag 12 star. At 500x in good seeing, I had an excellent view of a crisp, slightly elongated 10" disc with an irregular surface brightness.  In steadier moments, annularity was evident and there appeared to be a tiny darker hole in the center with a brighter rim but no hint of a central star.  NGC 6565 is situated within a rich Sagittarius star field with a few faint stars within 1' and several brighter stars in the field.


13.1" (8/17/85): at 166x and UHC filter; moderately bright, small, round, clearly non-stellar, 10" diameter, high surface brightness.  Easy at 360x without filter, appears slightly elongated NW-SE, no central star visible.  Similar view on 8/11/85.


Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6565 = HN 42 on 14 Jul 1880 with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory.  NGC 6565 was the second of 17 planetaries he found using a direct-vision spectroscope attached to the large refractor.  He announced the discovery of the first dozen in Sidereal Messenger, Oct 1882.  Compared to NGC 6644, which was discovered the next night, NGC 6565 was "somewhat fainter, but with a larger disk" (The Observatory, 1881).


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6565 as "a minute oval ring 10"x8" in p.a. about 5°.  Considerably fainter along the major axis, and the center is relatively vacant."

18" (8/14/07): picked up at 94x as a "bloated" blue star of 11th magnitude.  Easy to verify with a UHC blink though only a moderate contrast gain.  Situated in a beautiful star field on the southwest side of the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud.  A very long dark lane (part of Barnard 304) crosses the low power field from SW to NE, passing to the north of the planetary.  In the 80mm finder at 25x this lane extends NE and is attached to the prominent dark cloud B92 on its southwest side.  At 260x this high surface brightness planetary displays a 10" disc with a 13th magnitude star barely off the east edge.


17.5" (7/8/94): bright very compact planetary at 220x with a mag 13 star at the east edge.  Excellent contrast gain with OIII filter.  A high surface brightness small disc is visible at 280x that is cleanly resolved from the following star.  Has a brighter center but no central star seen.  Located in a very rich Milky Way field on the SW side of the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (M24).


8" (8/15/82): appears as a mag 11 "star" at 100x.  Slightly non-stellar at 200x.  A slightly elongated disc N-S is visible at 400x.  Forms a close pair with a mag 12 star just east.  Situated in a rich star field.


Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6567 on 18 Aug 1882 using a direct-vision spectroscope with the 15-inch refractor at the Harvard College Observatory.  NGC 6567 was the 9th of 17 planetaries he found using this technique.  His RA, though, was 1.5 minutes too small.  The discovery was announced in AN 2459 and Sidereal Messenger, Oct 1882.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6567 as "an oval dic, growing rapidly brighter toward the center; 8"x5" in p.a. 150° in the shorter and about 11"x7" in the longer exposures.  Exceedingly faint ansae are suspected in the prolongation of the major axis, making the total length 20", but these may be very faint stars..."

William Herschel discovered NGC 6569 = H II-201 = D 619 = h3736 on 13 Jul 1784 (sweep 237) and recorded "F, pL, lbM, r."  His position (CH's reduction) is 9' too far northeast.  This globular was the second most southerly object WH discovered.  James Dunlop observed NGC 6569 on 2 Jun 1826 and recorded "a pretty well-defined round nebula, about 2' diameter, slight condensation to the centre."  He made 2 observations and his position was 14' too far east.


On 3 Aug 1834, John Herschel described the cluster as "globular; pB; L; R; glbM; 4' diam, resolved into stars 15m."  He also noted that on 16 Jul 1836, the cluster was "Found in equatorial [5-inch refractor] in a zone review for double stars, where it appeared as a F, R neb 1' diam."

48" (4/4/11): I only took a quick look at this colorful planetary in the 48-inch at the end of the last night when the seeing the poor, but I could tell the very high surface brightness blue/green component was surrounded by much fainter outer halo that appeared slightly pinkish!


24" (9/1/16): at 200x, 375x and 500x; extremely high surface brightness, saturated blue-green disc slightly elongated oval N-S, perhaps 14"x10".  A very thin shell appears to encase the disc and occasionally an extremely low surface brightness outer halo appears to extend mostly north and south.


18" (8/2/05): at 225x I noticed an interesting color effect; although the color was a quite prominent bluish-green, while staring at the center the planetary decreased in size and the color changed to a deep emerald green (color vision is strongest with a direct view).


18" (8/14/04): at 225x, strikingly bright emerald green oval, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~15"x12".  Increasing to 435x this compact planetary appears elongated 3:2, ~16"x11" and brightens towards the center with direct vision, although the color becomes bluish and washed out.  The surface brightness is too high to pick out a central star.  There appears to be small, faint envelope encasing the planetary.


18" (7/19/04): at 225x this small planetary is very bright, with an obvious blue-green color.  Generally, the color appeared a vivid emerald green and other times there was bluish tint to the color.  The main body is only ~8" in size with a thin halo elongated ~SW-NE increasing the size to roughly 15"x11".  It appears to have a much larger, very low surface brightness halo, though perhaps this is scattered light as the planetary has such as a high surface brightness.  This halo is still evident at 322x, roughly 30" in diameter.


17.5" (6/3/00): at 220x appears as a very bright, small, intense blue oval, ~15"x12".  At 280x-500x, a thin outer envelope is obvious with the inner oval a uniform high surface brightness.  No central star visible.


13.1" (8/24/84): very bright, small, about 15" diameter, slightly elongated N-S, extremely high surface brightness, blue color.  Very faint outer halo is elongated N-S.  No central star seen.

Wilhelm Struve discovered NGC 6572 = ∑ 6 = h2000 on 18 Jul 1825 with the 9.6" Fraunhofer refractor at the Dorpat Observatory.  It was included in his list of 9 "Nebulae detectae" in an appendix to his main catalogue of double stars, which was published in 1827.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Bessel earlier measured NGC 6572 in 1822 during his "Zone observations" at Konigsberg, but didn't mention it as being nebulous.


John Herschel first observed this planetary on 9 May 1828 and recorded "a beautiful round, perfectly well defined and brilliant disc, equally a star 8-9 mag.  White equably bright.  Well seen in broad morning twilight.  A * 9-10m follows, 2' dist.  The sweeping power shows it as a * of large diameter, which could not escape examination in a good night; with 240 the disc seen as described.  It cannot be more than 4" diameter."  On 19 Aug 1830, JH showed the planetary to Wilhelm Struve at Slough.  Auwers made several measurements of the size, including 6.4"x5.3", and Secchi (1856) measured it at 7.5"x7.2" and noted a brighter center.  At Birr Castle, the color was described as "very blue".


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6572 as "an oval disk, fading out slightly towards edges, 14"x9" in a 5 min exposure and 16"x13" in the long exposure. No structural details visible."

On the north side is more scattered circular group of a couple dozen stars.  Finally on the east side is another elongated group oriented NW-SE with the brighter stars on the SE end.  This field is located 25' due west of the rich cluster NGC 6583.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6573 = h1999 on 28 Jul 1830 and reported "A cluster composed of 2 or 3 clusters of very small stars, and loose large ones.  Perhaps this is an outlier of V. 31 [NGC 6583]."  NGC 6583 lies 2.0 min of RA east of JH's position.  ESO calls this number NGC 6573 a "Concentration of 5 or 6 stars only".

17.5" (7/1/89): faint, small, round.  A mag 14.5 star is at the NE end and a mag 15 star at the south end.  Image confused by these two close faint stars.  A wide pair of stars is 12' SW.  Located in the UGC 11156 group and incorrectly identified as UGC 11155 in the RNGC.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6581 = St I-9 on 1 Jul 1870 and recorded "barely visible, seems hazy, very small, between two faint stars."  There is nothing at his position.  But Harold Corwin found the coordinates of his 8th magnitude offset star are off by 11 seconds of RA east and 30" of dec south.  Once that correction is applied, Stephan's position is just 2 seconds of RA east of CGCG 142-021= PGC 61571. This galaxy has a mag 14 star at the northeast end and a mag 15 star at the south end, matching Stephan's description.  Esmiol made an error in his 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's positions, as he picked the wrong offset star.


Bigourdan independently found this galaxy on 1 Jul 1886 while searching for NGC 6581 and listed it as Big. 222 in his fifth Comptes Rendus list.  Dreyer recatalogued the galaxy as IC 1280, so NGC 6581 = IC 1280.  MCG, CGCG and UGC label this galaxy IC 1280.  RNGC misidentifies UGC 11155 as NGC 6581.  UGC 11155 is 13' south of the (erroneous) NGC position.  This error is included in my RNGC Corrections list #4.  Malcolm Thomson also discusses the identification of NGC 6581 and IC 1280 in his unpublished "Catalogue Corrections" and as well as Harold Corwin in his NGC/IC identification notes.

The western member of the pair (MCG +08-33-028) appeared faint to fairly faint, very small, round.  Contains a very small bright nucleus and a faint 15" halo.  The centers of the two galaxies are separated by 33" WNW-ESE and the halos are just separated.  NGC 6582 is the brightest in a group of galaxies at roughly 700 million l.y.


MCG +08-33-026, located 6' W, appeared fairly faint, small, round, 15" diameter, weak concentration to the center.  A mag 15.0 star is off the NW side [27" from center].  This galaxy is often misidentified as NGC 6582.  UGC 11149, 3' SE, is faint, small, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, ~20"x15", very small slightly brighter nucleus.  A group of 5 stars is close south and east with a mag 11.5 star 1.5' E.  MCG +08-33-023, 13' WNW, is faint to fairly faint, fairly small, round, 20" diameter, weak concentration.

Just off the northwest end is MCG +08-33-029, a fainter companion that was cleanly resolved in good seeing.  It appeared very faint, very small, slightly elongated, 0.3'x0.2'.  CGCG 254-021 (often misidentified as NGC 6582), located 6' W, appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 10" diameter.  A mag 15 star is close  northwest [28" between centers]


17.5" (8/1/89): this is the following member of a double system.  Faint, small, round, weak concentration, faint stellar nucleus.  A companion is very close west just 33" separation between centers and appears very faint, small, round, low surface brightness.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6582 = Sw. IV-67 on 24 Jul 1884 and recorded "eeF; pS; R; in vacancy, between 6 stars like sickle in Leo, and 4 like alpha, beta, gamma and delta Ursae Majoris."  His position is 14 seconds of RA west of the double system UGC 11146 (apparently he only noticed the brighter eastern component).  The 4 stars forming a little bowl are south and the 6 stars forming a sickle are north.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 14 Aug 1892 as well as Howe in 1899-00.  Howe also noted "a star of mag 13.5 precedes about 2 seconds."  The mag 13.5 "star" is MCG +08-33-029, the western component of the double system.


MCG and PGC (and secondary sources including Megastar software) misidentify CGCG 254-021 as NGC 6582.  This galaxy is fainter than UGC 11146 and not between the group of stars described by Swift. UGC  has the correct identification.

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x this globular appeared fairly bright, moderately large, ~4' diameter with a broad concentration and a fairly symmetric appearance.  It was resolved into a couple of dozen faint stars, mostly in the halo, which appeared a bit ragged.  The central core was very mottled but unresolved.  A few brighter mag 11 stars are just outside the halo, but these appeared to be foreground stars. A mag 7.5 star is 13' NW and mag 7.0 star 15' NNE.  Located 2.8° SE of mag 3.7 Theta Arae at a distance of ~45,000 light years in the inner halo.

Three mag 11 stars cradle the globular on the south, east and northwest sides but appear to be field stars. A few faint stars were just resolved in the halo but the central region was unresolved.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): moderately bright, fairly small, 3' diameter, round, broad concentration to core.  Slight resolution at edges and three brighter field stars are off the NW, west and SW sides.  Observed at 14° elevation from Baja.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6584 = D 376 = h3737 on 5 Jun 1826 and described a "pretty bright round nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, moderately condensed to the centre; three very small stars involved in the preceding margin."  He claims 4 observations and his position is 6.5' due west of center.  John Herschel made two observations, first recording on 8 Jul 1834, "globular cluster; B; R; gmbM; entirely resolved into stars 16m; easily seen."

Edward Swift, the 16 year-old son of Lewis, discovered NGC 6585 = Sw. IX-87 on 25 May 1887. He reported, "eeeF; pS; E; eee diff; between several bright stars."  The Swift's position is 3' north of UGC 11159 (typical error) and the description is applicable as several fairly bright stars surround the galaxy.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer and published in 1890 after the NGC.  Bigourdan measured an accurate postion on 14 Jul 1890.  Howe also measured a good position in 1899-00 and noted "the elongation is at 45°, the nebula being 1.0' or more in length, and brighter in the middle.  It appeared to have a backbone or central stripe of greater  brightness than the rest."

There is nothing but faint stars near his position, which seems to be accurate as a mag 6.2 star (HD 167425) is 12' southwest.  DeLisle Stewart reported "not seen, several vF stars, no neb", based on plates taken at Arequipa, Peru and the ESO also states "several faint stars".  Harold Corwin lists three possible groups of stars or asterisms in his NGC positions file, but I've listed the number as "Not Found", as these are all uncertain.

On the following side, a small 1' glow seems overlapping, causing the east side to bulge out and extending the diameter to 5'x4'.  Forms a prominent pair with NGC 6590 6' SSE in a weakly luminous Milky Way field.

13" (7/16/82): very faint, larger than NGC 6590 to the south.  Surrounds two stars.  IC 1283/1284 lies just NE.


Truman Safford discovered NGC 6589 = Sf 81 = Sw. II-63 on 28 Aug 1867 and noted "*10m [with] pF nebulosity."  His position is 2.6' too far north, but accurate in RA.  Lewis Swift independently discovered this reflection nebula on 12 Jul 1885 and recorded "Another D* in center of an eF, pL nebulosity; np of 2 [with NGC 6590].  Except for the inequality of the stars and the excessive faintness of the nebula, it would resemble the preceding [Sw II-62 = NGC 6590]."  Swift's position was 35 seconds of time too far west (same error as NGC 6590, found the same night).  As Safford's discovery list was not published until 1887 when Dreyer had already compiled the NGC table, Swift was credited with the discovery.  E.E. Barnard measured an accurate micrometric position, which was published in AN 3101 and repeated in the IC I Notes section.


Finally, Harold Corwin suggests that Barnard's IC 4690 may a duplicate entry.  In "Some notes on nebulae and nebulosities" (AN 4239), Barnard writes "The two stars BD -19d 4881 and -19d 4946 are closely and densely nebulous.  The nebulosity about -19d 4881 is somewhat extended nf and sp."  BD -19d 4881 is not involved in any nebulosity, but Corwin suggests he meant BD -19d 4940 instead, and the extended nebula should read -19d 4946.  If that's the case, then IC 4690 = NGC 6589 and IC 4700 = NGC 6590.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6590 = Sw. II-62, along with NGC 6589, on 12 Jul 1885 and recorded "A nebulous D*; pF; sf of 2.  A D* in center of a pF, pL circular atmosphere, each * of the 8.5 mag and about 20" distant.  A wonderful object, not diff".  His position is 45 seconds of RA too far west, but his description clearly applies to this bright reflection nebula.


John Herschel was the original discoverer on 14 Jul 1830 and it was catalogued as h2002 = GC 4395 = NGC 6595.  JH's position was good, so it's surprising that Swift didn't realize the prior discovery.  E.E. Barnard corrected Swift's poor RA in AN 3101 and Dreyer noted NGC 6590 = NGC 6595 in the IC 1 Notes section.  By order of discovery, NGC 6595 should take precedence, though for some reason this reflection nebula is generally called NGC 6590.  Barnard's IC 4700, which derives from his mention that BD -19°4946 was densely nebulous (from a review of various photographic nebulae in AN 4239 in 1908), is another identity!

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6599 = St XII-89 on 27 Jul 1880 and recorded "pF, vS, R, gbM, tangent to a very small star."  His position matches UGC 11178.  Harold Corwin suggests Albert Marth may have discovered this galaxy on 6 Jun 1864 and recorded it as m 374 = NGC 6600, but his declination was 7' too far north.  As the identification of NGC 6599 is certain, this number is the primary designation.

See observing notes for NGC 6599.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6600 = m 374 on 6 Jun 1864 and noted "F, vS, stell."  The observation is marked as "verified", but there is nothing at his position.  However, 52 seconds of RA further east is NGC 6602 = UGC 11184 (separation of 12') and 7' due south of his position is NGC 6599 = UGC 11178.  So, either an error in RA or Dec leads to a galaxy he could have seen.  There is nothing (except a pair of very faint stars) at Bigourdan's "corrected" position of 1 Jul 1886.


The RNGC equates NGC 6600 with NGC 6602.   However, Harold Corwin suggests NGC 6600 is more likely a duplicate of NGC 6599, as it is brighter and has a higher surface brightness.  Stephan independently found NGC 6599 on 27 Jul 1880, measured an accurate position and reported it in his 12th list (#89).  As the identity of NGC 6599 is not in doubt, that is the primary designation.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6601 = Sw. I-90 on 4 Aug 1883 and logged "eF; R; pS; near end of a curve of stars.  4th of 8."  His position is 13 seconds of RA west of CGCG 301-019 = PGC 61533 and the comment "near end of a curve of stars" applies to this galaxy.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 6602 = Big. 83 on 1 Jul 1886 and recorded "appears to be a cluster of 30" dia, consisting of very dim stars, perhaps interspersed with nebulosity, distinct from GC 5907 [= NGC 6600].  There is nothing at his Comptes Rendus position but exactly 41 seconds of RA east is UGC 11184.  A star at the east edge perhaps gave Bigourdan the impression it was a cluster.  He later corrected the RA in the 6 May 1901 Comptes Rendus paper (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).


UGC, MCG and CGCG fail to label this galaxy as NGC 6602.  RNGC, though, identifies it as NGC 6602.  NGC 6600 may be a duplicate (earlier) observation of this galaxy (see notes on NGC 6600).

John Herschel discovered NGC 6603 = h2004 on 15 Jul 1830 and recorded "a glorious concentrated part of Milky Way, almost amounting to a globular cluster.  Star 14 and 15m.  The next night he logged "fine cluster of stars 15m; R; 6'; the stars are all of a size.  The cl seems connected with the Milky Way.  JH gave M24 as a synonym and this was mistakenly repeated in his General Catalog (GC) and Dreyer's NGC, but Herschel's description and position applies to the small, rich cluster within M24 (the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud).  In the NGC, Dreyer noted "h2004 = M24.  h's two observations hardly consist with this description [!, Cl, vRi, vmC, R, st 15 (M Way)], and their deviation of nearly +3m from Messier's place makes it very doubtful whether he really saw this object."


IC 4715 refers to M24 (the entire star cloud).  Barnard described the star cloud in detail (AN 4239) based on photos he took in 1905 and Dreyer assumed it was new.  But his position for the center is ~10 min of RA too large, so the connection with M24 was not made until more recently.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

Surrounding this arc is a 5' group of roughly two dozen stars elongated N-S, which includes two faint pairs. My observation of the surrounding emission complex Sh 2-54 is appended below.


16x80 finder (8/10/91): very large, very faint emission haze (Sh 2-54 = Gum 84) surrounding a very large group of stars, improves with UHC filter.  The Eagle Nebula was very prominent in the field to the south.  On the north side of this large HII region is a small brighter knot = Simeis 3-132 that was visible in the 17.5" at 64x using a UHC filter as a moderately bright, 3'x2.5' glow, slightly elongated N-S.  The eastern side of this HII knot has a sharper, linear border.  Also viewed at 220x unfiltered and a group of a half dozen mag 12-13 stars extended N-S in a string are superimposed near the eastern boundary.  This obscure, but relatively easy nebula is located 30' N of open cluster NGC 6604 on the north end of Sh 2-54.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6604 = H VIII-15 = h3740 on 15 Jul 1784 (sweep 238) and noted "a cluster of coarsely scattered stars."  His position is roughly 9' too far north-northeast.

18" (8/27/05): at 73x, this is a very undistinguished group of 80-100 stars scattered over 20' and appears to be just a typical Milky Way field.  Includes a mag 7.8 star (HD 167498) on the NW side and just NW of this star are a number of faint stars.  Otherwise, there is a noticeable lack of any rich spots or concentration and the central region is noticeably lacking in stars.  The only reason I can see Herschel may have been recorded this object is because it's somewhat detached in a low power field.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6605 = h2005 on 31 Jul 1826 and logged "A loose straggling cluster of stars 11...12m."  There is nothing at his position but 2 minutes of RA preceding is a scattered group of bright stars that Corwin identifies as probably NGC 6605.  Karl Reinmuth simply reported "no Cl" and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6608 = Sw. I-92, along with NGC 6607 and 6609, on 4 Aug 1883 and recorded "vvS; R; vF; vF * nr."  His position is just 5 seconds of RA preceding NGC 6609 = CGCG 301-021 = PGC 61559.  Although his positions for NGC 6607 and 6609 are offset 16-17 seconds of RA too far west, there is no third galaxy on the same parallel, just preceding NGC 6609.  However, MCG +10-26-024 = PGC 61556, is 2.3' south of his "corrected" position.  Since there are three NGC numbers from Swift and three galaxies, it's reasonable to assign MCG +10-26-024 to NGC 6608.  But there are several issues with this identification, besides the position.


MCG +10-26-024 is an extremely faint, narrow edge-on that I missed in my 18-inch on several attempts and I doubt Swift could have picked it up in his 16-inch refractor.  Howe missed it with a 20" when he examined the field in 1899-00.  Furthermore, there is no "vF * nr" to MCG +10-26-024 as in the description. Finally,  MCG +10-26-024 is extremely thin, so "R" does not apply.  Despite these inconsistencies, Corwin still favors NGC 6608 = MCG +10-26-024.


As an alternative, perhaps NGC 6608 is a duplicate of NGC 6609 = CGCG 301-021.  His description for NGC 6608 also fits this galaxy, but that implies Swift was confused and recorded the same galaxy twice.  MCG reverses the identifications of NGC 6608 and 6609 given here.  See Corwin's notes for NGC 6607 for the full story.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6609 = Sw. I-93, along with NGC 6607 and 6608, on 4 Aug 1883 and recorded "vF; lE; pS; F * nr."  His position for NGC 6607 is 17 seconds of RA too far west, so applying this same offset to his position for NGC 6609, lands at the north edge of CGCG 301-021 = PGC 61559, the brightest of three galaxies in a small group.  The "F * nr" applies to a mag 14.5 star off the south side, so this identification is certain.


Herbert Howe searched for these 3 galaxies in 1899-00 with the 20" at Denver and reported "a nebula supposed to be 6609 was measured in 2 nights.  Its position differs from that given by Swift only 16 seconds in RA and 0.4' in declination.  The "F * nr" is of mag 12, and lies about 25" south of the nebula, a little preceding.  There is another star of mag 13.5 which is one the opposite side of the nebula, at about the same distance."  His position matches CGCG 301-021.


MCG, RNGC and PGC misidentify CGCG 301-021 as NGC 6608, instead of NGC 6609.  CGCG and RNGC have the correct identification.  See notes on NGC 6608, which has an identification problem.

There is nothing at Stephan's position but Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's observations (http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1916TOMar...4D...9E), replaces NGC 6610 with an "anonymous" nebula, using a different offset star and separations.  The computed position coincides with NGC 6574 (discovered by Marth on 9 Jul 1863).  So, based on Esmiol's corrections, NGC 6610 = NGC 6574, with priority to Marth.

13.1" (8/17/85): a thin dark "finger" extends towards the cluster, positioned just south and beyond the two bright mag 9 stars near the center.  This is an extension of the wider projection seen previously several times and which is better defined along the south edge.

There is a considerable contrast gain to the nebulosity using a UHC or OIII filter.  With a UHC filter, a dark projection (called the "Star Queen") enters on the SE edge of the nebula and extends inward to the west. The cluster members surrounding the "head" of the eagle include ten mag 8-10 stars and a bright pair of mag 8.5 stars (8.2/8.8 at 27").  A dark triangular wedge is visible off the north side.

Philippe Loys de Chéseaux discovered M16 = NGC 6611 = h2006 in 1745-46 and reported it as a star cluster to the French Academy of Sciences.  Charles Messier independently found it on 3 Jun 1764 and stated "appears nebulous in a small telescope" and "enmeshed in a faint glow" but this appearance was due to the poor resolution of the stars in his telescope - not the involved nebulosity.  William Herschel, observing on 30 Jul 1783 with his small 20-foot (12-inch reflector), described "Large stars with small ones among them; within a small compass I counted more than 50, and there must be at least 100 without taking a number of straggling ones, everywhere dispersed in the neighborhood."  So, Herschel didn't note any nebulosity either.


Isaac Roberts discovered the nebulosity in the "Eagle Nebula" on a photographic plate taken in 1894 and it was catalogued as IC 4703.  But Wolfgang Steinicke claims that Étienne Léopold Trouvelot made a visual discovery of the nebulosity in 1876 with the 26-inch refractor at the USNO!  Robert Innes, observing in 1914 at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, reported "with the 9-inch refractor the nebula is just visible and it fills the perimeter of the cluster with faint extensions beyond."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6612 around 1886.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer, who referenced his 6th discovery list which was under preparation when the NGC was published.  But Swift didn't include this object in either in his 6th or later 9th list, which included several objects Swift discovered prior to the publication of the NGC.  His description reads "eeF; eS; R; v diff." and his position is 12 seconds of RA west and 3' north of CGCG 200-014 = PGC 61665, the only nearby galaxy.


Bigourdan measured an accurate position for this galaxy on 3 Jul 1897.  Howe reported "I was unable to find anything at the NGC position for this "v. diff." object, but I measured a supposed nebula about 5' away, making at the time of observation the note "eF, eS"; a little question whether there really is nebulosity here."  Possibly 6612 is identical with [IC] 1279, with an error of 5 minutes in R.A."  His position for the measured nebula matches CGCG 200-014.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6616 = Sw. II-64 on 14 July 1885 and recorded "vF; eS; eE; forms S equilateral triangle with 2 F st."  There is nothing at his position, but 25 seconds of RA west is UGC 11192 and his description applies (the stars are southwest and west).  Herbert Howe measured an accurate micrometric position in 1898-99 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

13.1" (7/16/82): the "Swan Nebula" is very bright, very large, with fantastic detail along the bright bar.  Has a turbulent texture with dark areas near the "hook".  A nebulous halo surrounds the brighter star to the south.


8" (7/16/82): very bright, large, very detailed.  The brightest portion consists of a long bright ray that hooks south at the west end.  A fainter section oriented N-S section follows.  The main bar is mottled.  The irregular hooked portion is clearly mixed with a dark nebula intruding.  Fainter nebulosity is visible north and south of the main bar.


Philippe Loys De Chéseaux discovered M17 = NGC 6618 = h2208 in 1745-46 from Paris and wrote, "It has perfectly the form of a ray, or of the tail of a comet, of 7' length and 2' broad; its sides are exactly parallel and rather well terminated, as are its two ends. Its middle is whiter than the borders.  Charles Messier rediscovered M17 on 3 Jun 1764 and described "a train of light without stars, 5' or 6' in extent, in the shape of a spindle, a little like that in Andromeda's belt, but the light is very faint..."


William Herschel, using his small 20-ft (12-inch aperture) telescope on 2 Aug 1783, called M17 "a curious train of light.  I cannot resolve it."  On 27 Jun 1786 (sweep 576) he logged "an extensive milky nebulosity of more than 20' in length, with a hook to the preceding side, bended towards the south; the extent is from np to sf and looses itself imperceptibly.  The hook includes a dark place, almost resembling that in the nebula of Orion."


On 6 Aug 1823 (sweep 48), John Herschel recorded "A large extended nebula. Its form is that of a Greek Omega with the left (or following) base-line turned upwards. The curved (or horse-shoe) part is very F, and has many stars in it. The preceding base-line hardly visible. The following, which is the principle branch, occupies nearly half the field (7 1/2').  Its light is not equable, but blotty. Strong twilight."  He didn't describe the nebula from the Cape of Good Hope, but his published sketch (plate II, figure 1) shows from 1837 shows a second curve at the east end, hooking north.  Based on the sketch, Dreyer referred to M17 as "2-hooked" in the NGC, an odd description.

48" (5/5/16): at 610x and 697x; NGC 6621/6622 is a spectacular interacting system (Arp 81 = VV 247) with an amazing tidal tail that wraps around both galaxies. NGC 6621 is sharply concentrated with a very bright, roundish core that increases to the center.  The main halo or arms is elongated ~3:1 NW-SE, ~60"x20" with slightly brighter "handles" (ends of the spiral arms) on the NW and SE end.  The enhancement on the NW side is more evident.


The southeast end merges with the halo of NGC 6622 with the cores of the galaxies separated by 40".  A very small knot (at most 10" in size) was visible on a line between the two cores [16" NW of NGC 6622 and 26" SE of NGC 6621]. The HST image reveals this is a prominent blue starburst complex at the edge of the two galaxies.


On the northwest end, a broad tidal arm wraps sharply counterclockwise to the southeast (the arm is easily visible in this part), dims into a narrow tail and extends southeast, paralleling (about 30" to the east) the major axis of NGC 6621. This one-sided tail extends ~1.5' in length in the direction of a mag 15 star due east of NGC 6622 and ends in a slightly brighter knot, ~25" NE of NGC 6622.


48" (10/22/11): at 488x the main body of NGC 6621, which completely merges with NGC 6622, appears bright, fairly large, elongated nearly 3:1 NNW-SSE, ~1.1'x0.4'.  Including NGC 6622 at the southeast end, the entire glow extends ~1.6'x0.4'.  NGC 6621 is fairly sharply concentrated with a bright 20" core that gradually increases to the center.  At 610x, a faint spiral arm is fairly evident attached at the NNW end and winding around counterclockwise to the north side of the main glow.  On the HST image this is the beginning of a long tidal tail that wraps around the north side of both galaxies.


18" (7/14/07): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, ~1.0'x 0.4', small bright core.  Brighter of a double system with NGC 6622 (Arp 81) attached at the southeast end in a common envelope.  The two nuclei of the galaxies generally appear as two knots near the ends of a single elongated bar though at moments the pair seems barely resolved.


17.5" (6/11/88): fairly faint, small, irregularly round, small bright core, stellar nucleus.  Forms a double galaxy in a common envelope with NGC 6622 just 40" SE of center.  A mag 15 star is 30" E.


Edward Swift, the 14 year-old son of Lewis, discovered NGC 6621 = Sw. I-95 on 2 Jun 1885.  The Swifts' position was 19 sec of RA too far east.  This galaxy is the brighter of a very close double system, just 40" between centers.  Apparently Lewis took another look in the eyepiece and discovered NGC 6622 = Sw. I-96.  The note "n of 2" and "s of 2" were probably added after noticing it was double.  Lewis Swift "discovered" this close pair again just two months later on 11 Aug 1885 and placed them in his second list (II-65 and II-66).  He noted "forms a close double with the preceding.  Very difficult to separate with power of 265.  Well seen."


Dreyer combined the two observations in the NGC, though the published position is 14 seconds of time too large and 2' too far south.  In addition, the RA is identical, though the orientation is northwest-southeast, and NGC 6622 is placed 0.2' north of NGC 6621. Bigourdan measured an accurate position for the pair on 28 Aug 1891 as well as Hermann Kobold in May 1899.  When Herbert Howe measured the positions in 1899-00, he assigned NGC 6622 to the northwest galaxy and NGC 6621 to the southeast (agreeing with Swift's dec values), but modern catalogues reverse the identifications, placing the numbers in order of RA.

NGC 6622 and 6621 form a spectacular interacting pair (Apr 81 = VV 247) with NGC 6622 fully merged on the southeast end of this trainwreck.  The cores of the two galaxies are separated by 40".  A small knot is clearly visible directly on a line between the two cores [16" NW of NGC 6622].  The HST image reveals this is a prominent blue star-forming complex at the edge of the two galaxies.  The amazing tidal tail of NGC 6621 that parallels the galaxy on the east side extends as far south as NGC 6622.


48" (10/22/11): at 488x, NGC 6622 appears bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, 30"x25", sharply concentrated with a bright core that increases to the center.  Merged with NGC 6621 on the NW side.  A mag 15.5 star lies 35" due east.


18" (7/14/07): faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  Forms the fainter member of an interacting pair with NGC 6621 (Arp 81) and appears as a knot at the southeast end of NGC 6621 in a common halo.  At moments this galaxy appeared barely detached.


17.5" (6/11/88): faint, very small, possibly round.  Forms an interacting double system with NGC 6621 and visually both galaxies appear enveloped in a common envelope with NGC 6621 just 35" NW.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6622 = Sw. I-96 on 2 Jun 1885, although his son Edward was credited with the discovery of NGC 6621 = Sw. I-95.  Apparently Lewis took a look in the eyepiece and noticed the smaller southeast component of this double galaxy.  His position is 18 sec of RA too far east.  Swift found the close pair again on 11 Aug 1885 and reported the discovery again in his second list (II-65 and II-66).  Dreyer combined both observations in the NGC.  Howe measured an accurate micrometric position, though called this galaxy NGC 6621 as Swift's position is slightly south of NGC 6622.

17.5" (8/3/97): at 100x, appears to be a Milky Way field in a large triangular region roughly bordered by mag 5.7 HD 169033 star at the SE vertex, a mag 8 star ~12' NW and a mag 9 star ~9' W.  This identification is uncertain as the region is completely indistinguishable from surrounding fields in star density and does not have any resemblance to a cluster although the Milky Way background seems locally brighter (also, JH does not mention the mag 5.7 star). At 220x, there is a fairly well-defined edge to portions of this Milky Way background and there is a small extension to the west near the star at the NW vertex.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC, though may be a true cluster.  Located just east of Sh 2-54, a large, faint HII complex and the slightly enhanced Milky Way background may be caused by the glow of Sh 2-54.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6625 = h2009 on 31 Jul 1826 and logged "A loose straggling cluster of stars 11...12m.".  His position is very close to mag 5.7 HD 169033, although if his position is accurate I'm surprised he didn't mention the nearby bright star.


Harold Corwin identifies NGC 6625 with a group of stars (possibly a cluster) to the west of the bright star or perhaps a larger Milky Way field.  Brian Skiff could not make a visual identification on two attempts and nothing stood out in my observation.  Karl Reinmuth also reported no clustering was found on a Heidelberg Observatory plate.

At 380x the edges of the core really start breaking up into numerous stars and a rich sprinkling of stars is superimposed on the well-defined core.

David Frew mentions in a Sky & Space article (Oct 1995) that Harlow Shapley misclassified NGC 6630 and IC 4723 as a pair of planetaries in his 1936 article "Five Planetary Nebulae and a Globular Cluster" (Harvard Bulletin No. 902).  The same list includes Shapley 1, Shapley 3 and IC 4642.  Evans & Thackery (1950) first imaged NGC 6630 (Plate II, No. 19) and they questioned the PN classification. "The classification is by appearance.  We find an object with a quadrilateral of 4 stars or nuclei surrounded by a nebulous envelope.  The object is difficult, and it seems open to doubt whether the object is correctly classified as a planetary nebula.  Dimensions about 19"x15"."  As a result of Shapley's error, Burnham's "Celestial Handbook", MOL (Master Optical List) and the NGC 2000.0 catalogue (Sinnott) misclassify this galaxy as a planetary nebula.  It was omitted, though, in Perek and Kohoutek's 1967 Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebula.  RNGC misclassifies NGC 6630 as nonexistent (Type 7).

Barnard found it while sweeping on 30 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory and noted "Faintish, R, vgbM, 2 small stars involved preceding, 1' diameter."  He later added in his logbook the correct identification.

15x50mm IS binoculars (6/19/09): this easy naked-eye cluster is more obvious than nearby, larger IC 4756, which has a lower surface brightness.  Partially resolved in binoculars with several resolved clumps of stars.


13.1" (9/9/83): very bright, very large but loose and scattered.  At 62x, 150 stars are visible in a 60' field with several bright stars on the SW side and many bright stars are outside this field including mag 5.5 SAO 123516 15' SSE.  This is a naked-eye open cluster in dark skies.


Philippe Loys de Chéseaux discovered NGC 6633 in 1745-46.  Caroline Herschel rediscovered the cluster on 31 Jul 1783.  She wrote, "About halfway from S Serpentarii [Ophiuci] towards Theta Serpentis, a cluster of large stars.  I counted about 80. Messier has it not."  On 30 Jul 1788 (sweep 850), William Herschel called it "a coarsely sc. cl. of L stars."

NGC 6634

18 29 57 -33 30 48; Sgr


18" (6/30/11): this is an unusual asterism of 4 brighter stars mag 8.4-9.2 forming a near isosceles trapezoid with a longer base of 4.4' and shorter base 1.5'.  Three of the stars were easily resolved in my 80mm finder at 12.5x and all four at 25x.  The asterism is striking at 115x in the 18-inch due to the shape and brightness of the stars.  The identification of NGC 6634 is uncertain and is traditionally applied to M69.


Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6634 = Lac I-11 in 1751-52 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  Messier thought this entry was duplicate of M69, though JH assigned it a separate GC designation (5076) and Dreyer followed in the NGC.  If NGC 6634 = M69, then Lacaille made a one degree error in declination.


But Glen Cozens argues that M69 is fainter than other objects discovered by Lacaille with his 1/2-inch telescope and the position is further out than others he discovered.  But near Lacaille's position is a small group of 4 stars that he may have mistook for nebulous with his small telescope. See Harold Corwin's notes for more on this identification and Jeff Corder's observations.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

48" (5/5/16): fairly bright, fairly large, warped edge-on 6:1 ~N-S, 1.8'x0.3', bright elongated core.  The southern half of the galaxy (including the core region) is slightly bowed out towards the west.  The northern extension, though, is subtly convex to the east.  So the opposite ends seem slightly misaligned and form a weak integral sign.  Adding to the asymmetry, the outer half of northern extension has a much lower surface brightness than the southern arm.  MCG +11-22-047 = PGC 61780 is a bright but very compact Seyfert II galaxy, ~10" diameter, just 20" NE of the core and attached to the east edge of the galaxy.  It is dominated by a bright stellar nucleus with just a small halo.  A mag 11 star is 2.1' due south and a mag 11.5 star (very unequal 6" pair) is 1' SE.


24" (7/21/12): moderately bright, moderately large, very elongated 7:2 ~N-S, 1.1'x0.3', small slightly brighter core.  Forms a contact pair with MCG +11-22-047 = PGC 61780, which is attached on the east side of the northern half.  The companion was easily visible as a very small "knot", perhaps 10" diameter with a fairly bright stellar nucleus that sometimes dominated the small halo.  The core of NGC 6636 (much lower surface brightness than PGC 61780) was close south-southwest of the companion.  Two mag 11 stars are 1.2' SE and 2.1' S.  An extremely faint, slightly non-stellar glow between these stars is a very close (~5") unresolved pair of mag 16.5-16.7 stars.


17.5" (6/11/88): fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated SSW-NNE, even surface brightness.  The compact companion attached at the northeast side was not seen.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6636 = Sw. IV-68 on 23 Jul 1884 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R; forms triangle with 3 st."  His position is at the west edge of UGC 11221 and the description fits.  Herbert Howe, observing in 1899-00, reported "the 3 stars mentioned by Swift are of mags 9, 9.5 and 10.5.  The one of mag 9.5 follows the nebula 4 seconds, 1.0' south.  The others precede, and are also south."

17.5" (7/29/92): M69 is bright, moderately large, 3' diameter, round, fairly symmetric appearance with a large core surrounded by a small halo.  A bright mag 12.5 star is embedded in the core or it contains a bright stellar nucleus.  Several easy mag 13.3-14.0 stars were resolved around the edges of the halo and 15-20 very faint mag 14-15 stars were resolved in the halo with averted vision.  Additionally, a few stars are also detected over the core. This is a very pretty globular with averted vision.  Located 4.5' SE of mag 7.9 SAO 21059.

15x50mm IS binoculars (8/3/11): small, fairly faint glow.  The mag 7.9 star 4.5' NW was cleanly resolved from the globular.


Charles Messier discovered M69 = NGC 6637 = D 613 = h3747 on 31 Aug 1780 and described "a nebula without star in Sagittarius... Near to it is a 9 mag star; the light is very faint; can be seen only in a good sky, and the least illumination of the micrometer wires extinguishes it... This nebula has been observed by M. de Lacaille and reported in his catalogue. It resembles the nucleus of a little comet. Diam. 2'."  Glen Cozens states that Messier mistakenly assumed Lac I-11 referred to M69 and Lacaille's object is more likely just an asterism.  See NGC 6634 or more.


William Herschel observed M69 in 1784 and noted "Very bright, pretty large, easily resolvable, or rather an already resolved cluster of minute stars. It is a miniature of the 53d of the Connoissance [M53]."  James Dunlop observed it 4 times and described "a pretty bright round well-defined nebula, about 1 1/4' diameter, gradually condensed to the centre; there is a small star about 1' south of the nebula."  John Herschel made 3 observations from the Cape of Good Hope.  On 1 Aug 1834, he logged "globular, B, R, vgbM, resolved into stars 14..15m, diam 10 seconds in RA."  Two nights later he noted "globular, pB, R, 3' diam, stars 14..15m."  Christian Peters reported finding it around 1850 in Naples (AJ 2, 1856) and claimed it do not appear in any of his books.

18" (7/22/06): at 435x this globular appeared fairly bright, ~3' in diameter with an intense 1' core.  The core appears very mottled and just begins to break up into a swarm of faint stars, particularly around the edges.  Several very faint stars pepper the halo and pop in and out of visibility.  The halo has an irregular scraggly appearance.  I was able to pick up this globular with 15x50 IS binoculars as a very small, faint glow along with a mag 9.4 star close south.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6638 = H I-51 = h3748 on 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236) and recorded "a pretty cons. easily resolvable R nebula, vBM and faint red perceivable.  A second miniature of that near the 42nd Comae [M53]."  JH made the single observation "B; S; R; psbM; diam in RA = 4.5s; barely resolved; a very delicate object; doubtless a globular cluster."

There are two small elongated subgroups of stars close NE and SE of the mag 11 star.  Located in a rich field 5' NE of mag 8.8 SAO 161547.  There are several richer pockets of stars, so this group appears to be another asterism.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6639 = h2011 on 31 Jul 1826 and noted "A closely clustering portion of the milky way, which is one continued cluster here."  His position is a close match with this group of stars.  Although listed as a cluster in the RNGC, the RA is 48 seconds too small.

The core is very lively and a few brighter stars are clearly resolved, though packed together very tightly.  Roughly 20 stars are resolved in the halo.  At 500x, 30-35 stars are resolved (many popping in/out of view) including 8-10 in a clump at the center and close to the core.  A single brighter star is just south of the core and a nice pair (~3" separation) is in the halo on the NNE side.  A string of stars extends out of the cluster to the north.

Eduard Schönfeld discovered NGC 6643 = Au 40 = HN 21 in 1858 while measuring stars for the Bonner Durchmusterung (BD +74 766).  This relatively bright galaxy was missed by both Herschels.  Horace Tuttle rediscovered the galaxy on 1 Sep 1859 using a 4-inch comet-seeker at Harvard College Observatory and called it "an elongated faint nebula" (reported in AN 1337).  Using the 6-inch Heliometer at Königsberg, Auwers described the nebula as "fairly bright, gradually brighter in the middle, elongated in PA 50°, 2.5 'l, 1.5' br. Two small star are immediately preceding; the major axis of the nebula is inclined only slightly with respect to their connecting line."


Around the time of discovery there was discussion this was possibly a "variable nebula" (a popular topic in the mid to late 19th century), based on very disparate descriptions by Tuttle and d'Arrest (4 observations in "Siderum Nebulosorum").  Wolfgang Steinicke provides the observational history in his book on the NGC discoveries.

Pickering noted in The Observatory (1881) that "its disk is so small that it can scarcely be detected with an ordinary eyepiece even if brought into the field of view."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "this object is indistinguishable from a star on the Crossley negatives, but visual observations made by Mr. Moore and Aitken with the 36-inch refractor show that it is a minute disk 2" to 3" in diameter."

17.5" (5/10/91): fairly bright globular cluster, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 2.0'x1.5', sharp small bright core with a substellar nucleus embedded.  The mottled halo was not resolved except for a mag 13 star 1' WSW of the core near the edge of the halo and a mag 14 star at the east edge.  Located 7' SE of mag 6.9 SAO 210344.


8" (7/31/81): moderately bright, small, compact bright core.  A mag 13 star is at the SW edge but there was no other resolution.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6652 = D 607 = h3747 with his 9-inch f/12 speculum reflector on 28 Jun 1826.  He described "a rather bright well-defined round nebula, about 12 or 14 arcseconds diameter, following a star of the 6th mag."  He claims 2 observations and the published position is 33' too far east.  The cluster is located 7' SE of a mag 6.8 star, so his identification seems secure, despite the rather small estimated size and poor position.


John Herschel observed this globular on 4 sweeps.  On 31 Jul 1834 he logged "B; pmE in parallel; gmbM, 60" long, 35" broad, all clearly resolved."  A few nights later he wrote  "pB; S; lE; 90" long, 75" broad, stars 15m."  On a third sweep he described "vB; S; 40"; resolved. Among close stars, which give it an elongated appearance, but do not seem to belong to it."


Pietro Baracchi observed the cluster on 5 Oct 1885 with the 48" Melbourne telescope and wrote "cB, small, irregular shaped, roundish, small vmbM to a very bright center.  Resolvable - cluster of minute stars - yes, a little elongated south-following."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6654 = Sw. I-97 on 11 Sep 1883 and "supposed it to be a nebula, though he had a slight suspicion it might be a comet."  He confirmed the object on 14 September, measured a different (more accurate) position matching UGC 11238 but reported it as a new comet to Harvard College Observatory.  While searching for Swift's "comet", Johann Palisa, observing with the 12" refractor at the Vienna Observatory on 20 Sep 1883, and Ernst Lamp, observing with the 8-inch refractor at the Kiel Observatory on 23 Sep 1883, both found this galaxy and assumed it was a new nebula.  Swift was probably both upset and embarrassed he was deceived by this "nebula".  He responded (AN 107, p273) by explaining his error and stating the nebula found by Palisa and Lamp was the same as he discovered but mistook for a comet.   Swift also said he was surprised that so bright an object was previously missed.  He included it in his first discovery list, with description "pB; R; mbM.  Looks like a comet."

18" (7/1/11): The identification of NGC 6655 is uncertain but may apply to an 11" pair of mag 13.3 stars that was easily resolved at 175x.  A third star of similar magnitude lies 35" NNW.  Located in a rich Milky Way field near the edge of the Great Rift and 17' E of mag 6.4 HD 171149.  Although there is no non-stellar object near Winnecke's position, his description: pF, S, E, 10"x3", would apply to this pair and the double might appear nebulous in poor seeing.


Friedrich August Winnecke discovered NGC 6655 = Au 42 in June of 1855 with the 9.6-inch Fraunhofer refractor at the Berlin Observatory and recorded "pF, S, E, 10" x 3".  There is nothing near his position and Arthur Auwers couldn't find this object on two attempts in 1859 and 1860 at Königsberg, but included it in his 1862 catalogue of new nebulae.  In 1865, Heinrich d'Arrest found a "small, inconspicuous, easily resolvable star cluster."


Harold Corwin suggests this may be a 11" pair of mag 14 stars, situated 19 seconds of time west, and 3.3' north of Winnecke's position.  See his identification notes.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

V = 5.2;  Size 24.0';  Surf Br = 1.1


24" (7/21/12): M22 displayed a few distinct orange/red supergiants.  Two colored stars are on the southwest and southeast side of the core.  A third fainter star forming an isosceles triangle to the north (closer into the core) is also orange/red.


17.5" (8/4/94): at 220x appears 10' diameter although outliers may significantly increase the total diameter.  The very bright core appeared irregularly round and 3.5'-4' diameter but not concentrated to the center.  M22 was extensively resolved to the center and there was no distinct nucleus.  At the NE edge of the core I noticed a rich small clump with 8-10 stars that collectively stood out well and an easy bright pair at the SE edge of the core.  The very irregular halo appeared more extensive on the NE side and seemed elongated SW-NE.  Dark lanes appeared to intrude into the cluster and involve the surrounding region, though this may be an optical effect.


8": very bright, very large, extremely rich.  A few hundred mag 11-13 stars were resolved and the globular appeared highly resolved down to the core.  A bright clump as visible in the NE section of the core.  The cluster contained a wide variation of magnitudes.  M22 is the second best globular for viewing from Northern California (next to M13), although it has brighter members).


Naked-eye (8/19/09 and 8/3/11): fairly easy naked-eye fuzzy (non-stellar) glow from Northern California.  Bracketed by two mag 5.5-6 stars about 35' NE and a similar distance west.


Naked eye: This is the third brightest globular in integrated magnitude (V  = 5.2) and generally a difficult naked-eye object in a dark sky from northern California.  It was a fairly easy naked-eye from Australia, though not as obvious as I expected.


Johann Abraham Ihle discovered M22 = NGC 6656 = Lac I-12 = h2015 = h3753 on 26 Aug 1665 during an observation of Saturn.  This was the first globular cluster discovered.  It was reported that Hevelius had seen it earlier, but he didn't include M22 in his list.  Edmond Halley observed and included this globular in his 1715 list of six nebulae.  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille observed M22 on 6 Apr 1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  William Herschel noted it was "All resolved into stars" on 4 Jul 1783 using his 12-inch reflector (small 20-foot).  On 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236), he called it "a most beautiful extensive cluster of stars of various magnitudes, very compressed in the middle. R and about 8' dia besides the scattered ones which do more than fill the extent of the field, L, r."


From the Cape of Good Hope, John Herschel recorded (sweep 793), "globular cluster; vB; vL; vm comp; vgvmbM; 7' diam.  The stars are of two magnitudes, viz., 15..16m and 12m; and what is remarkable, the largest of these latter are visibly reddish; one in particular, the largest of all (= 11-12m) sf the middle, is decidedly a ruddy *, and so I think are all the other large ones."

17.5" (8/3/97): at 100x a very unimpressive scattered group of ~15 stars elongated SW-NE is visible just south of a mag 9 star.  This weak collection includes 5 brighter mag 10-11 stars and a mag 9.5 star on the south end.  I would have passed over this grouping without using a GSC plot centered on the mag 9.5 star at JH's position.  At 220x, ~20 stars were counted in a 7'x3' region over some background Milky Way haze.  A small extension of this faint glow was seen to the south of the group with a few mag 15 stars resolved.  Looks entirely like a weak asterism and it is very surprising that it was logged as a cluster.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6659 = h2016 on 12 Jul 1830 and simply noted "A very poor cluster 8th class."  His position corresponds with a mag 9.5 star, the brightest in a 6'x4' (or larger) asterism, mostly north of this star.  Karl Reinmuth described "a very loose clustering of a few st 10...15."

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6668 = Sw. IV-70 on 31 Jul 1886 and logged "pB; pS; vE."  There is nothing near his position.  Herbert Howe, observing in 1899-00, reported "this is called 'pB, pS, mE' by its discovered, and therefore ought to be an easy object.  I have searched for it on 3 nights unsuccessfully, and conclude that no such nebula exists in or near the place given for it.  It may be identical to [NGC] 6677, which follows about 3 min at about the same declination."  Bigourdan was also unable to find NGC 6668.  Dreyer noted in the IC 2 Notes that NGC 6668 was probably identical to NGC 6677, based on Howe's suggestion.


Instead, Harold Corwin suggests NGC 6668 is a duplicate observation of NGC 6667.  This galaxy is exactly 50' north of Swift's position and his description "vE" applies (the NGC description is "mE").

RNGC and PGC probably misidentify UGC 11302 as NGC 6669.  This galaxy is located 45 seconds of RA east of Marth's position but also 6.5' south.  Furthermore Marth would have probably mentioned a mag 12 star superimposed on the north side.  See Corwin's notes.

In addition, IC 4751 and 4753, a 1.6' pair, lies 16' NW and IC 4754 is 20' NNW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6673 = h3755 on 7 Aug 1834 NGC and recorded "pF; R; psbM; r; 25"."  His position (measured on two nights) is accurate.

Édouard Stephan found it again on 27 Jul 1870 and measured an accurate micrometric position.  Voigt's discovery was never published and Safford's was published late, so Stephan was credited with the discovery in the GCS and NGC.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6676 = Sw. IV-72 on 30 May 1886 and recorded "eeeF; pS; lE; lbM; ee diff.; 2 or 3 others in field.".  His position is 13 seconds of RA west of UGC 11286 W of UGC 11286.   His "2 or 3 others" probably refer to NGC 6677 and 6679.  Bigourdan measured an accurate position on 5 Sep 1891 as well as Herbert Howe in 1899-00 with the 20-inch refractor at Denver.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6677 = Sw. I-98 on 8 Jun 1885 and logged "pF, pS, R."  His position was 17 sec of RA west and 2' north of UGC 11290, the largest of a compact trio.  Swift made a second observation on 25 Oct 1885, assumed it was a new object and included it in list III-100.  His second position was 12 seconds of time west of UGC 11290.  His notes mention "between a * v close and a vF D *". The "* v close" is probably a mag 14 star off the southeast end.  So, Sw. III-100 likely refers to UGC 11290, while Sw. I-98 may apply to UGC 11290 or perhaps nearby NGC 6679 = UGC 11288, which is more compact and has a higher surface brightness.  The NGC position appears to be a mean of Swift's positions.


Bigourdan's position from 5 Sep 1891 matches UGC 11290 as well as Kobold's micrometric position in 1899 with the 18-inch refractor at Strasbourg. Herbert Howe, observing in 1899-1900 with the 20" refractor at Denver reported "The NGC says "bet. * v close and vF D *."  I did not notice the very faint double star; the other is mag 12, and follows the nebula 2 seconds, 10" south."  His position corresponds with UGC 11290, though Dreyer did not publish his corrected position in the IC 2 Notes.  So, NGC 6677 = UGC 11290.


UGC and CGCG misidentify NGC 6677 as IC 4763, though RNGC appears to have the correct identification.  Malcolm Thomson discusses the identification in his unpublished "Catalogue Corrections".  Harold Corwin arrives at some different conclusions for identifications of NGC 6677, NGC 6679 and IC 4763.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6678 = Sw. I-99 on 8 Jun 1885 and noted "pF; pS; R."  There is nothing obvious near his position that he might have picked up and the closest galaxy is NGC 6667 = UGC 11269, situated 2.5 minutes of RA west and 8' further north.  Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 6678 may be a duplicate observation of NGC 6667, which Swift discovered earlier on 11 Sep 1883.  In addition, Swift's IV-70 = NGC 6668 may be a third observation of this galaxy (his position is off by 50' in declination).  So, it's possible NGC 6667 = NGC 6668 = NGC 6678 refer to UGC 11269.  Due to Swift's poor position, neither Bigourdan nor Herbert Howe could find NGC 6678.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes for more.

In a close trio with NGC 6677 1.7' SSE and MCG +11-22-056 = PGC 62026 is 0.6' N.  The MCG companion (identified as IC 4763 in MCG and as NGC 6679 in PGC and Megastar) appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 0.3'x0.2'. A 15th magnitude star is 18" NNE.

MCG +11-22-056 = PGC 62026 lies just 0.6' N. At 375x it appeared extremely faint or very faint, round, just 8"-10" diameter.  Once in my averted vision sweet spot, I could nearly hold this galaxy continuously.  A mag 15 star (brighter than the galaxy) lies 0.3' NNE.


17.5" (6/11/88): fairly faint, very small, elongated SW-NE.  One or two extremely faint stars are possibly involved or close off the edge.  Forms a close pair with NGC 6677 1.7' SSE.  MCG +11-22-056, a nearly stellar galaxy just 38" N was not seen.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6679 = Sw. IX-90 on 24 Jun 1887 and described "an extremely close double with [NGC] 6679; suspected with 132, confirmed with 200; perfectly separated with 250." This was the third time he visited the field, the previous nights on  8 Jun 1885 (list I-98) and 25 Oct 1885 (list III-100).  Dreyer concluded the first two numbers referred to NGC 6677, which is probably UGC 11290, the largest in the compact triplet.  Swift's position for IX-90 also matches UGC 11290, but in a 1894 issue of Popular Astronomy, Swift clarified that NGC 6679 is a close double, which is a better fit with MCG +11-22-055 = PGC 62029, which has a faint star at its southwest edge.


Dreyer made an error in the declination of NGC 6679, placing it nearly 10' further north than Swift's position in list IX.  Confusing the issue further is that NGC 6679 is a double system with an extremely faint component 35" north.  Bigourdan made an observation on 5 Sep 1891. He couldn't find NGC 6679 at Dreyer's incorrect place, but accurately measured PGC 62029 and Dreyer recatalogued this galaxy as IC 4763.  When Howe observed the field in 1899-00, he measured NGC 6677 and 6679 and described NGC 6679 as "a nebulous double star of mag 12.5, distance 5" and angle 60°.  The NGC place is 8.5' out in declination."  His position for NGC 6679 is an exact match with PGC 62029.  So, NGC 6679 = IC 4763.


The double system UGC 11288 is misidentified as NGC 6677 + NGC 6679 in the UGC and CGCG and NGC 6677 + IC 4763 in the MCG.   It doesn't appear that the northern component (MCG +11-22-056 = PGC 62026 ) was seen by Swift, Bigourdan or Howe although IC 4763 is often incorrectly assigned to this compact galaxy.  Malcolm Thomson (in his unpublished "Catalogue Corrections") and Harold Corwin assign different identifications for this confusing situation.

NGC 6682

18 39 37 -04 48 48; Sct


17.5" (8/12/01): this appears to be a large Milky Way field in the Scutum Star Cloud, at the eastern edge of the great rift.  At 64x (31 Nagler), there is no obvious cluster but two large, fairly rich, elongated condensations were noted.  The larger southern group is about 20' in size, extended NW-SE.  Connected on the following end to the north is another Milky Way patch, perhaps 15' in size.  Both groups are fairly rich with a background of haze.  The star density dramatically drops just east of this cloud (part of Great Rift) and then the Milky Way bursts into view again on the opposite side of the rift.  So the grouping only barely stands out due to location in an absorption hole at edge of the Great Rift.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6682 = h2017 on 25 Jul 1827 and recorded "A L p rich cl of straggling stars, having a vacuity in M and broken into 2 or 3 clusters.  Fills field.  70 or 80 stars of all magnitudes from 10 to 18 counted.  Extended, in parallel.  The most comp part f."  There is nothing at his position, but 2 minutes of time west is a large, scattered group fitting his description.  The positional error was repeated in the NGC, though Harold Corwin notes that Bigourdan gave a corrected position.  The RNGC classifies this object as nonexistent at the erroneous NGC position.

Unfortunately, Swift's published position falls close to a fainter third galaxy (IC 4772 = PGC 62217), which was discovered by Herbert Howe on 7 Sep 1898 and placed accurately.  The CGCG (228-021), MCG (+07-38-015) and UGC (11317) reverse the identifications of NGC 6685 and IC 4772, calling the NGC 6685 the fainter third galaxy.

His description "bet 2 stars, also bet 2 coarse clusters" applies to scattered groups of stars to the southwest and northeast.  So the identification is certain.  The comment "north-preceding of 2" might apply to NGC 6696, which was discovered 11 months later.

Lewis Swift found NGC 6690 = Sw. V-86 = Sw. V-85 on 16 Aug 1884 and recorded "pF; L; R; bet 2 st."  His position is just east of the core of UGC 11300 and the two stars are southwest and northeast.  He found this galaxy on 31 Oct 1886 and reported it as new in his 5th discovery list (#85) as "vF; pS; lE; nearly bet. 2 near st."  His second position was 2.5' too far northwest, although clearly it applies to the same galaxy.  Dreyer combined the two Swift entries into NGC 6690.


Heinrich d'Arrest made the first discovery on 22 Aug 1863 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen and listed it as #188 in his AN 1500 table.  His position (measured twice) is accurate and Dreyer catalogued this galaxy as NGC 6689, despite the very similar positions.  So, NGC 6689 = NGC 6690.  UGC 11300 is usually identified as NGC 6690, although by d'Arrest's prior discovery it should be labeled NGC 6689.


Herbert Howe observed NGC 6690 in 1899-00 and reported "this is given as "R" in the NGC.  But it really has two faint wings stretching out north and south from the much brighter centre, making the nebula 1.5' long.  At its northern end is a star of mag 12."

17.5" (6/30/00): this rich, distinctive cluster stands out well in the field at 100x.  At 220x, ~60 stars are resolved in a 7' diameter.  A mag 9 star marks the SW end.  About a dozen stars are arranged in a striking arc (concave to the west) just north of the mag 9 star.  A dark lane oriented N-S bisects the cluster just following this star chain and extending past the bright star.  On the east side of this lane is a rich group of stars, roughly arranged into two irregular ovals.


13" (7/27/84): about 40 stars mag 9-14 are resolved in a 7' diameter at 220x.  The brightest star is mag 8.8 SAO 142584 at the SW end.  A faint group of mag 13.5-14 stars is just east of the main section.  Located in a rich field.


8" (7/27/84): 20 stars mag 11-13, fairly small.  Consists mostly of faint stars except for the four brighter central stars that form a "kite" asterism.  Some dense sections of faint stars lie north and south in strings.


Charles Messier discovered M26 = NGC 6694 = h3758 on 20 Jun 1764.  On 16 Jun 1784 (sweep 228), WH noted "a cluster of scattered stars, not rich."    JH recorded (sweep 591) "cl VII class; p rich; irreg R; p well insulated; not much comp M; 10' diam; st 12...15m; one 9m taken."

18" (9/3/05): at 115x there was nothing notable at William Herschel's position.  Harold Corwin suggests a denser grouping about 25' N and at this location there is a very scattered Milky Way field of stars, ~20'-25' in diameter, but this star field does not stand out at the eyepiece.  In fact, the only object in the area that caught my eye was a small glowing 2' knot of stars at ~18 48.0 -25 43.7 (10' N of Herschel's position), though this knot doesn't match his description of "A suspected cluster of vF stars of considerable extent".  At 225x, ~10 stars were resolved within 1.5'-2'. The planetary M3-33 (see description) is situated within the grouping observed 25' N of the NGC position.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6698 = H VI-15 on 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236) and recorded "A suspected cluster of vF st of considerable extent."  There is no particular clustering at his position, although a 2' group of five mag 11-13 stars is 4' north.  JH did not make an observation, so there is little else to go on.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

In the Berlin refractor [9.6-inch Fraunhofer] it appears as a faint star cluster, but the place might be interesting, because it looks cometary in a small scope."

13.1" (7/16/82): at 140x, several hundred stars mag 11-15 and a brighter mag 8 star (SAO 142695) in a 10' region form a remarkably rich cluster including some dense knots of stars.  A starless vacuity is visible just west of center at medium power.  Dark lanes appear to wind through the cluster at high power grouping the stars into chains.  Several dark nebula are near including B108, B112, B318.


8" (7/16/82): this is the most impressive open cluster with this aperture.  Appears as an extremely rich carpet of faint stars and dense clumps in an arrowhead shape.


Gottfried Kirch discovered M11 = NGC 6705 = h2019 on 1 Sep 1681 in Leipzig, Germany and made a rough sketch (the bright mag 8 star is prominently drawn but no other stars).  William Derham first resolved it around 1733 with an 8-foot (focal length) reflector and described "..not a nebulose, but a cluster of stars, somewhat like that which is in the Milky Way" (PT XXXVIII, 70).  De Chéseaux also resolved it into "a wonderful cluster of small stars."


WH observe the cluster with his 10-ft telescope (4-inch aperture) around 1780 and noted the cluster was visible naked-eye.  JH wrote (23 Jul 1827), "A beautiful irregularly R cl 10' or 12' diam. The stars are all 11m except one = 9m whose place is taken. Examined with high magnifiers [I have often viewed it with 800 and even 1200]; it is broken into 5 or 6 distinct groups with rifts or cracks between them."  Observing with a 9.5" refractor around 1856, Father Secchi described the cluster as having three leaf-shaped dark lanes (AN 43, 157).


The nickname "Wild Duck Cluster" is from Admiral Smyth's 1844 guidebook "A Cycle of Celestial Objects".  He describes the telescopic appearance as "A splendid cluster of stars ...which somewhat resembles a flight of wild ducks in shape, is a gathering of minute stars, with a prominent 8th-magnitude in the middle, and two following".

24" (8/12/15): at 450x (10mm ZAO + 2x Powermate); nearly fills 5' field, excellent resolution over the entire surface with well over 50 stars resolved.  A dense group of easily resolved stars is on the west side of the halo.  A large number of fainter resolved stars is also on the south side.  The outer halo was ragged and straggling, with no distinct border but shot with numerous stars.  A well resolved, detached elongated section (separated by a lane) is on the south and southeast side of the halo.  Set in a beautiful low power field with planetary nebula IC 1295 24' ESE.  Observation at 8600 ft in excellent transparency in the White Mountains.


18" (7/23/06): situated in a gorgeous low power Milky Way star field at 115x with a dense background mat of faint stars filling the 45' field and planetary IC 1295 24' ESE.  At 435x roughly three dozen stars are resolved in a 6' region, mostly on the western half of the cluster.  The core is moderately bright but not sharply concentrated.  The irregular halo is peppered with faint stars though at the periphery it was impossible to really distinguish from these from the numerous faint field stars that surround the cluster.  A dark lane is quite obvious on the south side, appearing to detach the outer section of the halo on the southeast side.  The outer halo is poorly resolved on the eastern end.


18" (8/23/03): at 435x, approximately three dozen stars can be counted, although the eastern edge of the halo resists resolution.  A dark lane cuts through the cluster on the south side running SW-NE and detaching a small piece of the halo on the SE side and flattening the central blaze which begins just north of the lane.  IC 1295 lies 24' ESE and both are nicely framed within the field of the 20mm Nagler.


17.5" (6/29/00): at 220x this is a bright, moderately large cluster, ~6' diameter in a very rich Milky Way field.  Contains a relatively large, intense 3' core with a number of very faint stars peppered over the background glow.  A small, partially resolved piece is detached at the southeast end by a dark lane.  The surrounding halo includes a number of brighter stars, though it is difficult to untangle the maze of stars in the halo from the rich Milky Way background.  Roughly 30 stars are resolved at 280x, although it is difficult to accurately count. The core has irregular appearance with a flattened side caused by a sharp light cut off on the south side. PN IC 1295 lies 24' ESE.


17.5" (7/1/89): about two dozen stars resolved over haze.  A very rich clump is visible at the west side and a detached clump is at the southeast end.  The outline is irregular.

8" (7/24/82): grainy, very lively but only a few stars resolved over haze at high power.  Strong impression that in excellent seeing or a bit more aperture would resolve more fully.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6712 = H I-47 = h3762 on 16 Jun 1784 (sweep 228) and recorded "B, vL, easily resolvable, with many stars visible in it; of an irregular form."  John Herschel made a single observation on 27 May 1831 (sweep 591): "globular cluster; pL; F; R; rather irreg; vglbM; 6' or more in diam; all resolved.  A fine object, the stars being very close and numerous."

18" (7/2/11): at 285x, I initially noticed at this position a low surface brightness glow, ~1' diameter, mimicking a nebulous object.  When the seeing sharpened, though, the glow resolved into 4 extremely faint stars mag 15-16 (difficult to hold all simultaneously).  Nearly on a line with mag 8.6 HD 174788 5' NE and mag 8.9 SAO 18027 7.5' NE.  A string of three equally spaced mag 13 star begins 3' W.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6714 = Sw. IV-74 on 27 May 1886 and noted "eeeF; pS; ee diff.; sev B st nr north."  There is nothing near his position though several brighter stars are in the field.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.


Jeff Corder suggests NGC 6714 may be a small asterism of extremely faint stars 1 minute of time following Swift's position and 1' north.  Harold Corwin lists this asterism as a good candidate.  It fits Swift's description and three mag 8/9 stars (SAO 18021, 18025 and 18027) lie ~5' north and northeast.  Herbert Howe searched unsuccessfully for this nebula on three nights at Swift's position in 1899-00, but noted he found a group of four stars of mag 14, about 1 minute following the NGC place.  This is likely the same group of faint stars.

17.5" (8/2/86): very bright, fairly large, increases to a sharp bright core.  Five brighter stars were easily visible around the edges, though these are probably field stars as the brightest cluster members are V = 15.5.  The globular had a mottled, grainy appearance but there was no additional obvious resolution into stars.  Easily visible in the 16x80 finder.


15x50mm IS binoculars (8/3/11): easily visible as a small fairly faint glow.


Charles Messier discovered M54 = D 624 = h3763 on 24 July 1778 and described a "very faint nebula, discovered in Sagittarius. It is bright in the centre and contains no star, seen with an achromatic telescope of 3.5 feet".  On 24 Jun 1784 (sweep 232), William Herschel recorded "A round, resolvable nebula. Very bright in the middle and the brightness diminishing gradually, about 2.5' or 3' diameter. 240 power shews two pL stars in the faint part of the nebulosity, but I rather suppose them to have no connection with the nebula. I believe it to be no other than a miniature cl of v compressed stars resembling that near the 42nd Comae [M53]. It is like that under Delta Sagittarii [NGC 6624], but rather larger and brighter though not much."


James Dunlop found it "a very beautiful nebula, with a very bright round well-defined disk or nuclei, about 15 arcseconds diameter, surrounded by a gradually decreasing light or chevelure, about 1 1/4' diameter, this is exceedingly bright immediately at the centre."  He made 4 observations of the globular and his published position is 28' east of center (not an unusually large error).  John Herschel made several observations and noted on 1 Aug 1834 from the Cape of Good Hope, "Globular cluster; B; pL; vlE; gbM; 2 1/2' diam; resolved into st 15m, with a few outliers 14m."


M54 is the most distant Messier globular, roughly 85,000 light years away and lies close to the center of the Sgr Dwarf Spheroidal (SagDEG or Sgr dSph).  M54 is thought to be the core of the disrupted galaxy but it has been proposed that it formed independently and plunged into the nucleus of the Dwarf as a result of the decay of its orbit due to dynamical friction.

17.5" (5/10/91): about 40 stars visible in a 9' diameter, bright, fairly large but scattered.  Divided in two groups; the SSW group includes a mag 8 star and two mag 10 stars.  A mag 9 star is at the NE edge of the NNW group, which also includes several mag 10-12 stars in a curved arc.  Pretty empty between these two groups with just four stars in the center.  Not very impressive.

24" (8/23/14): this unusual globular, located just 2' S of Nu2 Sgr, was viewed at 375x and 500x.  The "core" appears as a fairly circular, fairly smooth glow, ~1' diameter, with a half-dozen stars superimposed.  With extended viewing a very low surface, irregular halo was noticed that increased the diameter to perhaps 2.5'.  At the center is an unequal pair oriented N-S (~5" separation), with the southern component, brighter and quasi-stellar.  A second pair of mag 14 stars at ~5" separation is on the NE side (this is IC 4802).  A mag 16 star is 10" S of this pair. Finally, another mag 14 star is at the WNW side of the core.


18" (7/15/07): at 280x, stands out prominently just 2' S of mag 5 Nu2 Sagittarii.  The globular appears as an unconcentrated, low surface brightness hazy glow just 1' in diameter but with five likely field stars superimposed, giving the appearance of a small open cluster over unresolved background haze.  At 393x, four out of these five mag 13 and fainter stars are grouped into two close pairs with roughly similar separations and orientations.  One pair is near the center (oriented ~N-S) and another is at the NE edge oriented NNW-SSE  (catalogued as IC 4802) while the 5th star is at the WNW edge.  The glow of the cluster is irregularly round (slightly elongated E-W) and has a well-defined edge, unusual for a globular.


18" (7/19/04): at 225x the view is quite unusual as the glow of the globular is just 2' S of mag 5 Nu 2 Sag.  The globular is just a fairly faint, round 1' glow with a low surface brightness and no evident concentration.  Quite striking, though, are several superimposed stars including a close pair of mag 14 stars at the NE edge.  At 434x, a star near the center is also clearly double and the halo of the globular has a ragged periphery.


17.5" (7/20/98): very unusual small, faint glow located 2' S of mag 5 Nu 2 Sagittarii!  The very faint background glow is ~1' diameter but more notable are several superimposed stars.  A close pair of mag 13.5 stars is at the NE edge 25" from center (this is IC 4802!) and a similar star is at the WNW edge 20" from center.  A very small bright core appears on closer inspection to be a close pair of mag 12.5 stars or possibly a bright stellar core and nearby star.  Other than the central "knot", the unconcentrated 1' background patch has a low surface brightness and is much smaller than the listed diameter of 4'.


13" (6/18/85): fairly faint, very small.  This globular appears as a hazy patch easily visible just 1.8' S of Nu 2 = 35 Sagittarii (V = 5.0)!  About half a dozen stars are either superimposed or resolved including two close pairs.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6717 = H III-143 = h2022 = h3766 on 7 Aug 1784 (sweep 245) and recorded "two or three minutes south of 35 Sagittarii are three vS stars which I suspect to contain nebulosity; but it is probably a deception, circumstances are not favourable enough to determine it."  His position was accurate.  At the Cape of Good Hope on 27 Jun 1837 (sweep 793), John Herschel reported "Close, to the south of, Nu2 Sagittarii; a very small clustering knot, with perhaps nebula.  A doubtful object.  I see 3 or 4 of the st, but there is also a nebulous appearance."


According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan's IC 4802, described as "neb *13, 15" nf III 143 [NGC 6717]" refers to a clump of stars northeast of the nucleus of NGC 6717 but part of the cluster.  George Abell found the cluster again while inspecting plates for the POSS1 around 1952 and didn't make the connection with NGC 6717.  As a result, this globular is also known as Palomar 9!

NGC 6720 = M57 = PK 63+13.1 = PN G063.1+13.9 = Ring Nebula

18 53 35.1 +33 01 45; Lyr

V = 8.8;  Size 86"x63"


48" (10/24/11): at 488x and 610x the central star was easily visible continuously in fair seeing.  Using 287x and an NPB filter, a much fainter large outer halo was easily visible surrounding the main bright ring (86"x63").  It appeared much more circular than the ring and ~2.5' diameter (roughly doubling the size), so appeared to extended further out in the direction of the ring's minor axis.  This outer shell was surprisingly evident and even displayed a slightly ragged or irregular edge.


28" (7/8/13): the Ring Nebula was examined at 658x using a 4mm ZAO and an "inverse OIII" or central star filter, which dramatically dimmed the nebulosity.  The central star was visible most of the time once acquired, though quite dim.  Surprisingly, a second interior star close northwest of the central star would occasionally pop and it was confirmed in the same position.  Finally, a third star was seen embedded in the brighter portion of the rim on the NNW edge (along the minor axis), though often it looked like a quasi-stellar knot.  In my 24" the central star was nearly continuous and the second interior star was highly suspected with the filter, although I didn't compare with the non-filtered view.


24" (5/25/14): observed M57 at 1000x (4.5mm Delos + 2x Powermate) in excellent seeing. The Ring itself was stunning with mottling, textured surface, and brightness variations across the ring clearly visible.  The central star was very faint, but visible ~75% of the time (sometimes as a quasi-stellar brightening).  Often, though, it was seen as a sharp stellar point.  Overall, this was certainly one of the finest views of the Ring I've experienced.


18" (6/21/03): I took a look at the Ring Nebula at very high powers  in steady seeing for the first time using my Starmaster w/Zambuto optics.  With the 2.5x Powermate, I used 538x, 807x and finally 1087x!  At 538x and 807x, the mag 15.7 central star flicked on and off several times, but only momentarily.  At 1087x, the central star was visible more consistently, flickering on/off regularly and cleanly visible for a few seconds at a stretch.


17.5" (6/5/99): Viewed under very steady seeing at 380x.  The halo was elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE and clearly brighter along the north and south sides (minor axis).  The ends of the major axis were clearly "thinner" and slightly fainter at the following end. The interior had a pale gauzy appearance.  The edge of the ring has a "wooly" appearance with a strong impression of small irregular wisps or filaments hinting at the extremely faint outer halo.  The central star popped in and out of view a few times.  A mag 13 star is close off the east side and a very faint mag 15.7 star is a similar distance off the west end.  Another mag 15.6 star is 1' due south of center.  At high power a 3" pair of mag 14-15 stars ~1.3' NNW of center were just resolved with a difficult mag 16.1 star ~30" further north.


17.5" (7/1/89): extremely faint central star visible for moments at 412x just east of center.  The central star was held steadily for a few seconds at best with averted vision.  Forms an unusual pair with the extremely faint galaxy IC 1296 4' NW.


13": very bright, moderately large, slightly elongated WSW-ENE, high surface brightness, best example of annularity although interior not dark.  Slightly fainter at ends of major axis.  Central star not seen.


6" (7/78): first view in a dark sky (Bryce Canyon), high surface brightness, ring-shape obvious, easily takes high power, slightly elongated.  Visible in 8x50 finder as a faint "star".


15x50mm IS binoculars (6/19/09): fairly faint but clearly non-stellar, appearing as a very small but definite disc.


Antoine Darquier discovered M57 = NGC 6720 = h2023 using a 2.5-inch refractor in early 1779.  He wrote, "nebula between Gamma and Beta of Lyra; it is pretty dull, but perfectly outlined; it is as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet." This description perhaps inspired the name "planetary nebula".  It has been assumed the Darquier's discovery preceded Messier's independent discovery, but Don Olson and Giovanni Maria Caglier reported in the June 2017 issue of Sky & Tel, that Messier definitely observed the Ring Nebula on 31 Jan 1779 while searching in the region of Bode's comet.  Darquier wasn't even aware of Bode's comet until at least 9 Feb, so Messier deserves discovery credit.  In any case, M57 was the second PN discovered, after M27 in 1764.


In 1785 William Herschel logged, "A perforated Nebula, or Ring of Stars. Among the curiosities of the heavens should be placed a nebula, that has a regular, concentric, dark spot in the middle, and is probably a Ring of stars. It is of an oval shape, the shorter axis being to the longer as about 83 to 100; so that, if the stars form a circle, its inclination to a line drawn from the sun to the center of this nebula must be about 56 degrees. The light is of the resolvable kind [i.e., mottled], and in the northern side three very faint stars may be seen, as also one or two in the southern part. The vertices of the longer axis seem less bright and not so well defined as the rest. There are several small stars very near, but none seems to belong to it."


The discovery of the challenging central star (V = 15.7 according to http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611543) is generally attributed to Friedrich von Hahn in 1795 using a 12" f/20 reflector (mirror from William Herschel).  Though he subsequently reported the "small star is no longer visible", I find his original observation unlikely as his telescope was probably equivalent to a modern 8" or 9" reflector.  William and John Herschel never reported seeing the central star, nor Lord Rosse in his 36-inch.  Apparently it was missed by Trouvelot with the Harvard 18" and Holdenwiththe Washington 26" refractor.  Rosse found the central star "pretty bright" with the 72-inch (first seen in 1848) and William Lassell sketched the central star with his 48" in 1860 (unpublished).  Father Secchi claimed an interior star was seen with the 9.5" refractor in Rome around 1865.  A second interior star was observed through the Lick 36-inch refractorand one at the end of the major axis.


The 1936 Carnegie Institute Yearbook mentions that a photograph made with the Mt. Wilson 100-inch by Duncan revealed a "faint, hitherto unrecorded envelope, roughly circular in outline and about twice the diameter of the well-known ring."  Soon afterwards, a larger outer envelope was found in NGC 6826.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very bright, beautiful symmetric globular at 128x.  The halo measures at least 7' with a sharply concentrated, blazing 3' core. Roughly 100 stars were resolved with a strong impression the core would more fully resolve using a higher magnification.  A single mag 10.5 star is at the NE edge of the halo.


17.5" (6/30/00): this is a beautiful, symmetric GC at 220x.  The halo extends to ~6' and is sharply concentrated with a very bright 3' core.  This core is highly resolved into a dense overlay of faint stars with a single brighter star just north of center.  The extent of the halo is ill-defined and consists of numerous brighter stragglers (or field stars) mixed with a sprinkling of dim stars.  Perhaps 70 stars are resolved in total.  In a remarkable region with a complex of unusual reflection nebulae (NGC 6726/27/29).


17.5" (7/29/92): at 220x, bright, fairly large with about 50 stars visible in a 4'-5' diameter.  Fairly symmetric appearance with no distinct edge.  Beautifully resolved into several dozen stars.  A mag 10.5 star is off the NE edge 3' from the core.  Mildly concentrated but no distinct nucleus although a star appears embedded at the center of the core.  The outer halo was well-resolved and a peppering of stars was resolved over the core.  In the same low power field with bright nebula NGC 6726, NGC 6727, NGC 6729 to the SE!


13.1" (8/24/84): at 220x many faint stars resolved beyond the main disc.

James Dunlop discovered NGC 6723 = D 573 = h3770 on 2 Jun 1826 and described "a beautiful bright round nebula, about 3.5' diameter, moderately and gradually condensed to the centre. This is resolvable. The moderate condensation, and the bluish colour of the stars which compose it, give it a very soft and pleasant appearance. This is rather difficult to resolve, although the condensation is not very great." Dunlop made 6 observations and his position is 16' too far east.


John Herschel credited Dunlop with the discovery despite the poor position and recorded on 31 Aug 1834 a "globular cluster; B; L; R or vlE; vgbM; diam 5'; perfectly resolved into stars 14..16m, with stragglers extending to 8' diam."  Christian Peters independently found the globular around 1849 at the Capodimonte Observatory in Naples and it was reported as new in AJ 2, 1856.  Apparently Peters didn't have access to JH's Cape Catalogue.

17.5" (7/24/95): at 100x appears as a small indistinct group in a rich Milky Way field.  Stands out better at 220x which increases the number of stars to 15 in a 2.5'x2.0' region (slightly elongated E-W).  There are five brighter mag 12-13 stars and 10 faint stars in this group and visually it appears to be an asterism.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6724 = h2237 on 5 Sep 1828 with a 5-inch Tully refractor (7-ft focal length) purchased in 1828 from James South and normally used for measurements of double stars.  This is the only object JH discovered using this refractor.  Only a rough RA (to the nearest minute of time) is given in the Slough Catalogue and there is no description.  Harold Corwin found there is no additional information in the Herschel Archive DVD material.


Karl Reinmuth states "no cluster" based on Heidelberg plates and this is repeated in Dorothy Carlson's 1940 paper.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.  Corwin mentions NGC 6724 may refer to a small, unimpressive group of stars about 5' northwest of his (rough) position.  But based on my 18-inch observation, I doubt this group of stars would have caught JH's attention in a 5-inch.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the south-southwest component of two very bright, similar reflection nebulae oriented SSW-NNE.   Both surround bright stars and are each 1.5'-2.0' in diameter with a separation of 57" (the two stars form the pair B 957).  The nebulae are in contact with overlapping halos forming a figure 8.  Also sharing this eerie dark field obscured by dust is the unusual cometary nebula NGC 6729 5' SSE.


17.5" (7/29/92): two bright, round nebulae oriented SSW-NNE: The SSW component (NGC 6726) surrounds a mag 7.2 star and the NNE component (NGC 6727) surrounds the variable star TY Coronae Australis (mag 9.5-10).  Both nebulae are roughly 1.5' diameter and in contact with overlapping halos.  The evenly matched double star BRS 14 = 6.6/6.8 at 13" is 13' SW.  Very unusual dark field is void of stars and set in a striking low power field with nebula NGC 6729 and globular NGC 6723.


8" (7/31/81): two fairly bright, round patches in contact surrounding a wide pair (B 957) consisting of a mag 7.2 star and the variable TY CrA (8.8-12.5) at 58".  A closer double star BRS 14 (6.5/7.0 at 13") to the SW.  In a stunning low power field with NGC 6729 and globular cluster NGC 6723.


Julius Schmidt discovered NGC 6726, along with NGC 6727, in October 1860 with the 6.2" refractor at the Athens Observatory.  He made a second observation on 8 Feb 1861 (also NGC 6729) that was published in 1865 (AN 65, 263) and mentioned it was first seen in 1860.  Albert Marth rediscovered this bright reflection nebula on 2 Jul 1864 and noted "* 7m in a F, pL, white envelope."  As these bright reflection nebulae are only 30' SE of the showpiece globular NGC 6723, it's surprising they were missed by John Herschel.

In Oct. and Nov. 1915, Robert Innes, at the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, reported the star CPD -37 8450 (= TY CrA) was a new variable.  Although normally mag 8.7, he noticed it was mag 12.4 on 29 Oct 1915 and mag 11.5 on 24 Nov.  He also remarked "that the nebulous envelope is also variable.  As this envelope actually touches another one of about the same size [NGC 6726] it is most excellently situated for comparison."

17.5" (7/27/95): large, scattered group of mag 11-14 stars in a 7' triangular outline.  Fairly easy to pick out at 100x.  There are no rich clumps but many stars are arranged in strings and loops, forming the outline.  A small equilateral triangle of mag 12 stars with sides ~30" is situated at the center of the group.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6728 = H VIII-13 on 16 Jun 1784 (sweep 228) and noted "A coarsely scattered clusters of stars; the stars nearly of an equal magnitude."  There is nothing of note at his position.  Karl Reinmuth reported "no Cl, a dense region" in his photographic survey at Heidelberg.  RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.


Harold Corwin suggests WH's object may be a group of stars (Isserstedt 662), a little over a minute of RA west near 18 58.8 -08 58 or a larger, more scattered group at 19 00 28 -08 59 (2000).

Size 1'


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this remarkable variable reflection nebulae has a distinct cometary or fan-shape similar to Hubble's Variable Nebula.  The cometary nebula extends from mag 10 erratic variable R CrA (9.7-13.5) at the NW end and fans out towards the SE towards the fainter variable T CrA (mag 11.7-13.5) at the SE edge of the nebula.  R CrA is a pre-main sequence star with 2 to 10 times the mass of the sun and is embedded in the Corona Australis molecular complex, one of the closest star-forming regions.


The region to the southeast (DN Bernes 157) of NGC 6729 is remarkably void of stars!  This opaque dark void (molecular cloud) appeared as a huge, elongated dark swath.  Within a field of nearly 20', the absorption is very high with only a couple of stars visible near the edges (a solitaire interior star is 14th mag VV CrA) and beyond that only a scattering of faint stars!  Also the field centered on NGC 6726/27/29 was strangely devoid of stars.  The appearance of this entire region was unusual and striking.  Gamma CrA lies just off the east edge of this molecular dust cloud.


17.5" (7/29/92): fairly faint, elongated 4:1 WNW-ESE, 2.0'x0.5'.  Variable star T Coronae Australis (mag 11.7-13.5) is attached at the SE end and the nebulosity extends to WNW.  Variable star R Coronae Australis (mag 9.7-13.5), which illuminates the nebula, is at the NW end.  The unusual cometary appearance is similar to Hubble's Variable Nebula.  The brighter reflection nebulae NGC 6726/NGC 6727 lies 5' NW.  Located in a remarkable field of nebulosity and the bright globular cluster NGC 6723.


13.1" (8/15/82): at the edge of the field with NGC 6723 is this cometary nebula.  Elongated with a star attached at the tip.


8" (7/31/81): faint, elongated nebulosity attached to R Coronae Australis (9.7-13.5) with a comet-like appearance.  Located 5' SE of brighter NGC 6726/6427 in a remarkable field.


Julius Schmidt discovered NGC 6729 on 15 Jun 1861 with the 6.2" refractor at the Athens Observatory.  He noted a faint, but clearly visible stellar nebula involved with a star identified as "nx", though his reported RA in 1865 was 4 minutes too large (typo). Albert Marth rediscovered this bright reflection nebula on 1864.50 (about 2 Jul) and noted "*13m with a vF, nebulous tail."  His position is accurate.


The illuminating star is variable R CrA (T Tauri type).  Schmidt discovered the variability of R CrA in 1866 and the variability of T CrB in 1876.  He also suspected the nebula was variable.  Observing with the 7" refractor at the Cape Observatory, Robert Innes confirmed the probability of the nebula's variability and reported R and T CrA "seem to be placed at the two ends of the major axis of a faint elliptical nebula, which is brightest to R."  With the 18" refractor on 15 Oct 1900, he noted "the nebula does not extend to T CrA and that it is fan-shaped, agreeing very closely with Marth's description."


Delisle Stewart first photographed the region on 4 Aug 1899 at Harvard's Arequipa station, followed in 1910 at the Transvaal (Union) Observatory at Johannesburg with the Franklin-Adams camerand by Knox-Shaw at the Helwan Observatory starting in 1911 with the 30-inch Reynolds reflector.


In describing the opaque dark cloud that spreads SE of NGC 6729, Innes wrote in 1910: "Both Mr. Worssell and the writer when examining this region have suspected the presence of an obscuring medium as the cause of the unusual lack of stars.  In fact, the 9-inch refractor with a field of 25' can be pointed to one part of the region, so that not a solitary star of any magnitude is to be seen.  There is probably no other such region in the whole sky.  Mr Worssell considers that when the edge of the blank region is made to cross the field of the low-power Zeiss eyepiece with an apparent diameter of about 30', a distinct difference in tint between the blank and starry parts of the sky is perceptible."

Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6741 on 19 Aug 1882 using a direct-vision spectroscope with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory.  The discovery was announced in AN 2459 and The Observatory, Vol 5, for Oct 1882.


Robert Jonckheere mistakenly catalogued this object as a double star (J 475) in 1911, based on observations with the 14-inch equatorial refractor at the University of Lille.  The following year he reobserved it with the 28-inch Greenwich refractor and realized it was nebulous and identical to the planetary NGC 6741 (see http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1915Obs....38..478J).


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "No central star.  A small bright oval, 9"x7" in p.a. 95°.  It shows traces of an indistinct ring structure, being somewhat fainter along the major axis.  There is a small, scarcely perceptible protuberance at the western end."


John Mallas coined the nickname "Phantom Streak" in his Jun/Jul 1963 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebula-V", published in the "Review of Popular Astronomy".  He writes:  The "Phantom Streak."  First you see it and then you don't...In the 4-inch looks like a broad silver line.  Almost uniform in brightness, the ends appear broken and diffused...My visual impression agrees with H.D. Curtis's description of this object.  He states "It shows some trace of a ring structure, being somewhat fainter along the major axis."

The offsets stated here are relative to a very small bright nucleus, which was sharply concentrated within the core.  A non-stellar knot was noted 2.5' NW of the nucleus.  A second knot was seen 2.9' ESE of the nucleus and a third was just 1.6' NE of center.  Roughly a dozen "stars" are superimposed on the galaxy and some of the fainter ones may be stellar HII knots.  Spiral structure was too subtle to see any definite arms. IC 4823 (a double system) lies 18' SE.


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this massive barred spiral appeared fairly bright, large, oval 3:2 ~N-S, roughly 8'x6' with a large, bright core. About a half-dozen stars are superimposed over the face of the galaxy - some of these are possibly small HII regions. A hint of spirality was suggested within the outer region but no definite spiral structure was observed.  NGC 6744A lies 12' NW but was not noticed.  Member of a sparse group including NGC 6684 and IC 4710 at 25 million light years.


20" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): bright, large, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, ~9'x6'. A bright, oval core or bar is surrounded by a moderately low surface halo with an impression of "motion" or arcs embedded within the outer glow.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6744 = D 262 = h3776 on 30 Jun 1826 with his 9" reflector from Parramatta (20 km W of Sydney).  He described "a pretty large very faint nebula, about 5' or 6' diameter, slightly bright towards the centre; a minute star is north of the nebula, and two stars of the 7th mag preceding."  His position is 1 min 45 sec of time too far west (12' error).   On 20 Jun 1835, John Herschel recorded "pB; R; at first vg, then svmbM; total diam 2', but that of the bright part = 15"." His position is accurate.

48" (10/24/11 and 10/26/19): we observed the "Bird's Head" galaxy at 488x and 610x and the same detail visible in the April observation was seen.  In addition, I took notes on the detached companion (PGC 200361), which was immediately noticed just off the north edge of NGC 6745. It appeared very faint, small, elongated 3:2 N-S, ~12"x8".  With averted vision it was continuously visible.


48" (4/1/11): this interacting galaxy pair or triple was a fascinating sight at 488x.  The main body is bright, very asymmetric, extending 2:1 N-S, ~1.1'x0.5'.  The brighter east side is noticeable curved or bulging to the east and bends on the north end towards the west.  A thin strip along the eastern edge glows brighter.  The western edge of the main galaxy is relatively straight and dimmer.  The south end has a fairly blunt or rectangular appearance.  At the north end, a very unusual bright spike or "bird's beak" with a high surface brightness juts out of the main body, perhaps 12"x4" (catalogued as NGC 6745 NED03 = PGC 200362 = KTG 69B).  A very faint, very small detached glow, ~5" diameter, is just north of the "beak" (catalogued as NGC 6745 NED02 = PGC 200361 = KTG 69C).


13.1" (7/20/85): fairly faint, edge-on SSW-NNE.  At 220x appears to bend on the NNE end to the west.  This is a disrupted interacting system on the POSS and the extension seen at the NNE end may be the contact pair.

Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6748 = St II-26 on 17 Jul 1871 and recorded "pB, vS, bM."  There are no nonstellar objects close to Stephan's position despite 5 measurements from his reference star.  This object was considered lost until 2016.   Then Harold Corwin found that Stephan's offsets from one observation (of 2) of NGC 6751 on 17 Jul 1871 given in Esmiol's 1916 re-reduction of Stephan's offsets, matched the calculated offsets Stephan gave in his second discovery list (II-26).  Esmiol simply left NGC 6748 off of his published paper and made no special note of the 1871 observation, but clearly NGC 6748 = NGC 6751. RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

V = 12.4;  Size 6.3';  Surf Br = 4.6


24" (7/20/12): NGC 6749 was surprisingly easy to sweep up at 200x and it was immediately noticed in the field as a fairly faint, fairly large, irregular glow, ~2.5' diameter.  Still, the surface brightness is low for a globular, there was no noticeable concentration, and it somewhat blends into a rich Milky Way star field.  At 325x several very faint stars were resolved, mostly around the edges.  The easiest group to resolve are four or so along the north and northeast side.  Another couple of stars are at the south and southeast edges.  Brighter (field?) stars are off the southwest and east edges.


18" (8/2/11): this challenging NGC globular is highly obscured and just stands out clearly from the rich Milky Way background glow.  At 225x it appears as a very faint diffuse glow, roughly 2' diameter, with a low surface brightness and a small brighter core.  A 12th magnitude star is superimposed and the slightly brighter core of the globular is located about 45" SW of this star.  The edge of the globular is not well defined but appears to just reach a mag 12.5 on the south end.  Additional mag 11-13 stars are clearly off the east, west and south side of the halo. Four mag 12-13 stars just off the south side form a small trapezoid that helps to pinpoint the location of the globular.  Located 26' ENE of mag 5.8 HD 177178.


17.5" (7/1/00): very faint, very low surface brightness globular in a dusty portion of the Aquila Milky Way (dimmed by at least 4.5 magnitudes of extinction).  The core is 15"-20" slightly brighter spot less than 1' SW of a mag 12 star.  The surrounding halo is just a weak glow with averted vision, 2'-2.5' in diameter with an ill-defined edge, and just brighter than the Milky Way background.  The glow encompasses the mag 12 star on its northeast side but does not reach two mag 13.5 stars off the south side. This cluster would most likely be overlooked if just quickly scanning the field and along with NGC 6380 it is one of the two most difficult NGC globulars!


17.5" (7/24/95): very faint, ~3' diameter, unusually low surface brightness for a globular cluster with only a very weak central brightening.  A mag 12 star is superimposed on the north side and two mag 13.5 stars are at the south end (not members).  The core appears to be located ~1' SW of the mag 12 star. Does not appear like a globular but rather a diffuse nebula in a rich Milky Way field.  Difficult to determine exact outer extent.


13.1" (8/11/85): extremely faint, moderately large, very low surface brightness and fades at high power.  Near the visual threshold this is one of the two faintest NGC globulars along with NGC 6380.  Estimate V = 14.  Located at the NW edge of an elongated group of six mag 12/13 stars and 25' ESE of mag 5.8 SAO 124203.  The position listed in the NGC, SC2000, NGC 2000, U2000, and DSFG are all about 7' too far south.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6749 = h2029 on 15 Jul 1827 (single observation) and recorded "a cluster of loose small stars of various magnitudes; fills the field."  His position is 8' south-southwest of this highly reddened globular cluster.  But, I'm not convinced JH was referring to the globular, which is only ~3' diameter visually and unresolved in most telescopes.  The visual appearance doesn't correspond with a object that "fills the field" with "loose small stars of various magnitudes. His description seems to apply to the general Milky Way field here, which is very rich. JH catalogued a number of rich Milky Way fields that caught his eye and this may be another case.


Bigourdan examined the area on 24 August 1891 and wrote (Corwin's translation), "Extended region, slightly rich in stars, but which offers nothing remarkable.  "Using Heidelberg-Königstuhl plates, Reinmuth remarked "a dense region, but no distinct cluster."  Dorothy Carlson repeated "No Cl" in her 1940 paper on NGC identifications and this is referenced in the RNGC, although the classification is globular cluster.  Lynga classified it an open cluster and labeled it Berkeley 42.  The position given in Sky Catalogue 2000, Luginbuhl & Skiff, NGC 2000.0, Uranometria 2000, and Deep Sky Field Guide (first edition) are all wrong (for the globular), mostly off by ~7' in declination (probably from the JH and NGC position).


Harold Corwin writes, "A more appropriate scattering of stars actually overlaps the globular but extends well to the southwest...even if this is JH's intended object, I think that it is no more than a random clumping of Milky Way stars."

24" (9/30/16): symmetric, very attractive planetary at 450x (unfiltered).  The edge of the 20" rim is crisply defined.  The mag 14.5 central star is easily visible.  Annularity is evident with a brighter rim except for a section of the south edge.  The center is slightly darker around the central star.  In a rich star field with carbon star V Aql 30' NW.


18" (8/26/06): excellent view at 257x.  The central star was easily seen and the rim appeared brighter with the center slightly darker.  There also appeared to be a thin outer shell.  A mag 14.5 star is close off the east edge and two mag 14/15 stars off the west side.  At 435x, the planetary is perhaps slightly elongated ~E-W and one or extremely faint stars occasionally sparkle, with one possibly on the west edge.  The stunning carbon star V Aql is in the same low power field 30' NW and dark nebula B134 lies 20' SE.


18" (7/19/04): at 322x, this is a beautiful 20" fairly bright disc with an easy mag 14.5 central star.  At 435x, the surface brightness is irregular and there is an impression that an extremely faint star or knot is superimposed on the north side or perhaps the rim is irregularly brighter along the north side.  The planetary is bracketed by two stars just off the leading and trailing sides.


18" (9/20/03): moderately bright, round, 20" planetary.  Excellent view at 435x; the halo has a subtle irregular surface brightness and seems slightly fainter near the center and it also appears to fade slightly at the edge of the halo. The mag 14.5 central star shines steadily.  Situated in a rich star field with a mag 13.5 star at the east edge with fainter stars off the west side.  The dark nebula B134 lies 20' SE and the deep red variable V Aquilae in 30' NW.


17.5" (6/3/00): fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter.  At 500x, the surface brightness is uneven and the planetary appears darker on the SE side of the center.  The mag 14.5 central star is obvious at 500x.  Two stars just off the east and west edge (fainter star is at the preceding side) bracket the planetary.  Situated in a rich Milky Way star field.


13.1" (8/16/81): fairly faint, small, round.  The mag 15 central star is suspected at high power.  A mag 13.5 star is right at the east edge and a mag 12.5 is 55" ESE of center.  Located 30' SE of the striking deep red variable V Aquilae (6.6-8.4).


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6751 = m 397 = St XII-90 on 20 Jul 1863 using Lassell's 48-inch equatorial reflector on Malta and noted "pB, S."  His position is 2' too far south.  Édouard Stephan found it on 17 Jul 1871 and logged St II-26 (later NGC 6748) as "bright, small, round, central condensation, seems resolvable."  He misidentified his reference star, though, and NGC 6748 was lost onto 2016 when Harold Corwin noticed the offsets for an observation of NGC 6751 given in Esmiol's re-reduction matched Stephan's computed offsets for NGC 6748.  So, NGC 6748 = NGC 6751.  Stephan made a second observation (St XII-90) of NGC 6751 on 3 Aug 1881 and measured an accurate micrometric position.  In the notes section to list XII, he mentions a 2' error in Marth's polar distance, so he was aware of the prior discovery.  Williamina Fleming first recognized it as a planetary nebula in 1907.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "central star about mag 12.  The nebular disk is 21" in diameter, nearly round, and shows indistinct evidences of a very irregular ring formation."

V = 5.5;  Size 20.4';  Surf Br = 0.1


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 6752 is one of the top globular clusters (4th brightest in integrated magnitude and 2nd in terms of brightest members) and was spectacular from Magellan Observatory.  At 128x, this naked-eye cluster seemed fully resolved with an uncountable number of stars densely packed over a large region.  Streamers in the halo greatly increased the diameter to roughly 20'.  The central region was well-compressed to a very bright core!  There was a strong 3-dimensional effect as the core was covered with scores of fairly bright stars seemingly superimposed over a rich mat of fainter stars and all set over a background glow.  The nucleus was small and very bright.  Many 11-12th magnitude stars in the halo formed complete loops and long chains.  A mag 7.7 double star is superimposed on the SW edge of the halo (h5085 = 7.7/9.2 at 2.8").  This was one of my favorite objects from Australia!


12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this naked-eye cluster ranks second in terms of brightest members (mag 11.5). The 4' core has several dozen mag 12-13 stars, many arranged in streaming curves and chains layered over a dense central glow.  The halo is large but irregular with knots of mag 11-12 stars over a diffuse background.  The brighter members, particularly in the outer halo give the visual appearance of a globular embedded in a larger, open cluster!


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, fairly large, 10' total diameter with a 2' brighter core that increased to very bright nucleus.  The large halo was very mottled and partially resolved although viewed at only 6 degrees elevation as the brightest stars are mag 11.  15-20 stars mag 11-12 were visible around the edges of the core and within the halo in curved strings.  Mag 7.7 SAO 254482 (h5085 = 7.7/9.2 at 2.8") is embedded in the SW portion of the halo 4.3' from the center.  Ranks second in terms of brightest individual stars and appears very rich.


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6752 = D 295 = h3778 on 28 Jul 1826 at Parramatta Observatory (near Sydney) with his homemade 9-inch f/12 reflector.  His full description reads: "a pretty large and very bright nebula, 5' or 6' diameter, irregular round figure, easily resolved into a cluster of small stars, exceedingly compressed at the centre. The bright part at the center is occasioned by a group of stars of some considerable magnitude when compared with those of the nebula.  I am inclined to think that these may be two clusters in the same line; the bright part is a little south of the centre of the large nebula." He recorded the cluster on 5 times.


JH also made multiple observations.  On sweep 480 (7 Aug 1834), he recorded "globular cluster; B; rich; psmbM; 7'.  The stars are of 2 magnitudes, the larger 11m, run out in lines like crooked radii. The smaller, 16m, are massed together in and round the middle."

24" (8/27/14): although the listed diameter is 15', the most eye-catching region extends only 5' and is described as the southern group in the earlier observation.  The stars are arrange in two main groups.  On the west side is a "U" shaped group of a dozen stars, open to the northwest, with the brightest mag 10.3 star at the southwest end of the loop.  A nice unequal pair (~12" separation) is ~40" SE.  Another couple of pairs (one very close) is along the east side of the loop.  A smaller (~2' dia) but richer group of a dozen stars is 2'-3' NE.  A long looping string of ~20 stars, including two 10th magnitude, begins close southeast of this group and curves to the south and west, ending in a small knot of 4 stars. The region between this loop and the two groups described above contains 10-12 mag 15 stars.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6758 = h3781 on 9 Jun 1836 and noted "pB; R; 20"."  His position is fairly accurate.  Joseph Turner observed and sketched the galaxy on 2 Aug 1877 with the Great Melbourne Telescope.  He noted a diameter of about 25", gradually brighter in the middle, 3 faint stars forming an obtuse triangle follows.

24" (8/12/15): viewed at 564x in excellent seeing and I was impressed with the resolution compared to previous views.  The 2' core was extremely mottled and lively with roughly two dozen very faint stars popping in and out of view, but only a relative few constantly visible.  Another couple of dozen stars were resolved in the halo, mostly in a 180° arc along the entire southern side.  The stars along this arc are confined to a fairly thin strip that appeared detached from the core.  Also a sparse string of stars extends northeast of the core.


18" (7/19/04): at 225x, moderately bright and large, round.  The halo extends to 4'-5' and increases fairly rapidly to a fairly bright 2' core.  The cluster has a very mottled appearance and some very faint stars are resolved in the halo.  At 435x, the core is extremely lively and several extremely faint stars pop in and out of visibility for moments.  There are several stars in the halo that are easily resolved, mostly notably on the east and southeast side.  Also the globular appears slightly elongated at this magnification.


18" (8/23/03): at 323x this globular appears moderately bright, round, nearly 4' diameter, broad concentration to a slightly brighter 2' core.  A half-dozen stars are resolved around the periphery with several of these on the southeast and east side.  With averted vision a few additional stars sparkle over the center.  At 538x, 10-12 stars are resolved around the edges of the halo and the core is very lively and on the verge of resolution.


17.5" (8/8/91): moderately bright, round, 3' diameter slightly elongated E-W, very mottled or granular appearance.  A few very faint stars are resolved over the core and at the edge of the core.  With averted vision the faint halo increases in size to 4' diameter.  Several stars bracket the halo including a mag 13.5 star off the east edge.  A rich mostly unresolved clump of extremely faint stars is close west.


8" (6/22/81): faint, small, no resolution, very diffuse.


John Russell Hind discovered NGC 6760 = Au 44 on 30 Mar 1845 using a 7-inch Dollond refractor, while employed at George Bishop's private observatory in London.  He reported "On the night of 1845 March 30, I found a faint nebula of a circular form... There does not appear to be any previous notice of this nebula, and Sir James South informs me that he can find no registered nebula within two degrees of this place.  This somewhat singular as the present object was found while searching for comets with our 11 foot refractor."


Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered the cluster in 1852 (announced in AN 809) while searching for comets with the 4.6-inch Fraunhofer refractor in Leipzig, though he later corrected his announcement.  Arthur Auwers reported that in the 6" Heliometer it was "quite bright, R, gbM, 2-3' diameter." but once it was "surprisingly faint."  At Birr Castle, Dreyer reported it as "vB, L, iR, vgpmbM, like a distant glob. Cl, although not distinctly resolved with the higher powers.  eF curved branches go out from the south side."


John Herschel noted in the General Catalogue that this nebula was suspected of variability due to the widely disparate visual brightness estimates.  A photograph was taken with the Mount Wilson 60-inch in 1914 due to comments about variability and the cluster was resolved into "1200 stars ranging approximately from 16.5 to 19.5 photographic magnitude...No trace of nebulosity is found."

Lewis Swift found NGC 6762 = Sw. II-75 on 30 Apr 1884 and noted "eF; vE."  His position and description is nearly identical to NGC 6763, which Swift discovered exactly 8 months earlier (30 Aug 1883) and catalogued in the same list as #76.  So, NGC 6762 = NGC 6763.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6763 = Sw. II-76 on 30 Aug 1883 and recorded "eF; vS; cE; F * nr; D * in field.  n of 2"  His position is 14 seconds of time due west of UGC 11405 = PGC 62757 and the description applies.  He apparently found this galaxy again exactly 8 months later on 30 Apr 1884 and catalogued it in the same list as Sw. II-75 = NGC 6762.  The qualifiers "s of 2" and "n of 2" were added as he was preparing his manuscript to be published.  Herbert Howe commented in Monthly Notices LXI (1900) that "NGC 6762 and 6763 are identical; Swift admits it [in a correspondence].  The region was scrutinized one night, the definition being fine.  A star of mag 13 follows the nebula 1 second, a few seconds of arc south.  It is doubtless the star referred to in the description of 6763, and does appear to be nebulous."  Both Howe and Bigourdan measured accurate position.  So, NGC 6762 = NGC 6763.  The primary designation should be NGC 6763, due to the earlier discovery, though NGC 6762 is often used.

24" (6/29/16): at 260x; moderately bright, very elongated 5:1 WSW-ENE (central bar), ~1.7'x 0.35', broad weak concentration, sharp stellar nucleus.  After careful viewing, a very low surface brightness halo surrounds the bar, which increased the size to ~1.7'x0.6'.  Three mag 14-15 stars are at the south side including a 10" pair parallel to the major axis [25" south of the nucleus].  A faint non-stellar knot was visible at the ENE end of the bar.  Occasionally it was elongated and angled towards the north.  A matching knot was suspected (lower contrast) at the WSW end of the bar.


Forms a pair with LEDA 214715 2.7' ESE.  At 260x, the companion appeared faint to fairly faint, small, slightly elongated E-W, 20"x16" or perhaps 15"x12", weak concentration, slightly brighter nucleus. Visible continuously at this magnification.


13.1" (10/20/84): fairly faint, diffuse, fairly small, slightly elongated WSW-ENE, very diffuse edges.  Two or three faint stars are superimposed on the halo south of center although one of these may be a faint stellar nucleus.  A nice double star is 6' WNW (mag 11/12 at 20").  Located on the Cygnus-Draco border.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6764 = Sw. II-77 on 4 Jul 1885 and recorded "pF; pL; cE; sev vF stars involved."  His position is on the west side of UGC 11407 and the involved stars are on the south side of the galaxy.  Herbert Howe, observing with the 20-inch refractor in Denver in 1899-00, commented "the elongation is north and south.  Four stars of mag 13.5 are involved, one near each end, and the others in the middle."  Howe's description seems inaccurate.

18" (7/16/07): this unusual planetary was picked up at 174x unfiltered as an elongated glow.  The view is confused, though, as a star or knot in directly involved at the NE end, along with 1 or 2 additional stars around the edges.  An OIII filter provided an excellent contrast gain. The edges sharpened up and the halo appeared elongated 2:1 SW-NE, ~0.6'x0.3'.  At 225x, a mag 14-15 star is just off the NE end and the involved knot seemed to occasionally resolve into a couple of faint stars just north of center near the NE edge.  Finally, an extremely faint star occasionally sparkled at the SW end.


17.5" (9/5/99): picked up at 100x as a small, irregular glow in a rich star field by moving 20' NW of ∑2483 = 7.9/9.0 at 10".  At 220x, the PN is clearly elongated ~2:1 SW-NE.  The appearance is odd with a much brighter NE end and a fainter extension to the SW end.  A mag 14.5-15 star is just off the NE end in the direction of the elongation.  At 380x, a very faint star was intermittently glimpsed within the NE end.  If this is the central star it is very eccentrically placed.


13" (6/18/85): faint, elongated SSW-NNE, appears similar to a diffuse galaxy.  A faint mag 14.5 star is at the NE tip.  Located 20' NW of ∑2483 = 7.9/9.0 at 10".


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6765 = m 398 = Sf 42 = St II-27 on 28 Jun 1864 with Lassell's 48-inch on Malta and noted "F, S, mE or ray."  His position is accurate.  Truman Safford independently rediscovered this object on 12 Jul 1866 using the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at Dearborn Observatory in Chicago (he also found the planetary NGC 6842 in Vulpecula the same night!) and again by Édouard Stephan on 20 Jul 1870 with the 31-inch reflector at Marseilles.  Dreyer credited Stephan with the discovery in the GC Supplement (GCS 5941), but both Marth and Stephan are listed in the NGC.  Minkowski entered it as the 68th object in his first discovery list (M 1-68) of "New Emission Nebulae" (1946), based on objective prism plates taken with the 10-inch Bruce Astrograph at Mount Wilson, and missed the equivalence with NGC 6765.

Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6766 = HN 53 on 8 May 1883 by means of a spectroscopic sweep with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory.  The discovery was announced, along with NGC 6833, in AN 2517 and noted as mag 11 and with a "faint continuous spectrum."  There is nothing near his position. When double-star observer Reverend Thomas Espin tried to find this object in Sept and Oct 1911, he was unable to locate it.  Espin noticed, though, that the RA of NGC 6766 was exactly 1 hour less than the RA of NGC 6884, another stellar planetary.  Espen sent a letter to Pickering, who confirmed the 1 hr error in AN 105 (2517) and he published the story in 1911MNRAS..72..150E.  The corrected position for NGC 6766, though, had already been published in the discovery table in 1908 Annals of Harvard College Observatory.


Ralph Copeland independently discovered this planetary on 20 Sep 1884 at Dun Echt, Aberdeen using an objective-prism sweep with a 6.1-inch refractor. His position is accurate.  His observation was catalogued as NGC 6884.  So, NGC 6766 = NGC 6884.  Although Pickering's NGC 6766 was the earlier discovery, the primary designation is NGC 6833 due to its unambiguous NGC position.  RNGC classifies NGC 6766 as nonexistent.

17.5" (7/27/95): unimpressive coarse group of ~20 stars in a 7'x2' rectangular outline elongated N-S and appears to be nothing but an asterism.  Includes six brighter mag 9-11 stars.  The stars in this weak asterism simply form the border and there are no stars inside.  The extent of the group is arbitrary but I included a few mag 11 stars to the south giving the elongation.  A mag 8.5 star located 14' NE is closely surrounded by a group of six faint stars.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6773 = h2033 on 13 Aug 1830 and noted "Coarse, not very rich, eighth class."  His position corresponds to the brightest mag 9.5 star at the west end of the group.  Karl Reinmuth, based on its photographic appearance, wrote "no Cl, a few st pretty much sc."  Dorothy Carlson repeated "No Cl" in her 1940 paper on NGC corrections as well as the RNGC.

13.1" (8/5/83): large, scattered field of 50 stars mag 11 and fainter in a 20' diameter although no real borders.  Does not contain any rich spots.  Possibly not a true open cluster.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6774 = h2034 on 27 Jul 1830 and recorded "a very large straggling space of loose stars, 8, 9, and 10m."  On a second sweep (27 Jul 1830), he logged "a fine, L, loosely scattered cl of large with some small stars.  Fills 2 or 3 fields."  His single good position matches mag 8.4 HD 180326, near the center of this large, loose group.  The Sky Catalogue 2000.0 calls the cluster Ru 147.

Size 12'x4'


24" (9/30/16): at 200x; the most compressed grouping is at the east end and includes a half-dozen brighter stars including a nice linear string.  Perhaps 20 stars are resolved in a 2.5' region.  A nice sprinkling of 13th and 14th magnitude extends to the east for ~10'.  There are no dense clumps, but just enough stars to catch the eye.  Combined, the group is somewhat detached in the wider field and extends ~12'x 5', roughly elongated WNW-ESE, with the main clump at the ESE end.


17.5" (8/19/95): at 220x appears as a small, faint group of about a dozen stars mag 12.5-14.5 in a 2.5' region.  Most striking is a rich string of six stars oriented E-W just 1.5' in length.  Stands out reasonable well at 100x but higher power brings out a few fainter stars.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in RNGC and not in Lynga 5.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6775 = h2035 on 19 Jul 1828 and logged "A cluster, poor, loose, irreg fig, stars 10 and 11m."  At his position is a distinct group of 10-12 stars described in my observation.  This may be an asterism and RNGC lists the cluster as nonexistent (Type 7).

30" (10/18/17 - OzSky): at 264x; fairly bright, moderately large, slightly elongated N-S, ~0.9'x0.75'.  Sharply concentrated with an intensely bright core that increases to a very bright stellar nucleus.  A mag 14.8 star is off the south side, 1.2' from center and a mag ~14.5 star is at the northwest edge [25" from center]. Mag 9.8 HD 181463 lies 4.6' SW.


NGC 6776A lies 10.8' NNW. At 264x and 429x it appeared fairly faint, moderately large, extremely thin streak, ~1.0'x0.15', with a slightly brighter nucleus. A mag 12.3 star at the north edge interferes with viewing.  The nucleus of the galaxy is just south of the star [by 16"].


18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright, fairly small, roundish, 0.8'x0.7'.  A faint star is just off the northwest side, ~30" from the center.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6776 = h3787 on 20 Jun 1835 and logged "pB; R; psbM; 15"."  There is nothing at his single position, but 1.7 minutes of RA east and 1.5' north is ESO 104-053 = PGC 63185.  There are no other bright candidates nearby, so this identification is fairly secure.  DeLisle Stewart's corrected RA (given in the IC 2 Notes) is 1.6 minutes further west, instead of east

Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6777 = Lac I-13 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2" telescope at 8x, during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted "it resembles the preceding [a small nucleus of a comet]."  Based on plates taken at Harvard's Arequipa Station, DeLisle Steward reported "Not seen, 2 st 8 or 9 mag nr, but no neb."  This is a 2' pair of mag 8-8.5 stars (HD 181354 and HD 181464) very close to Lacaille's position.


The RNGC classification is galaxy, but the position falls on a blank piece of sky just 4' east of Lacaille's.  As an alternative, Harold Corwin states "NGC 6777 may be NGC 6752 (first suggested by Owen Gingerich in a Sky and Telescope article which appeared in the February 1960 issue on page 207). If so, there is a large error in Lacaille's position."

V = 12.1;  Size 25"x19"


18" (8/26/06): at 115x appears as a fairly bright but small, round disc with a blue-grey color.  Excellent view at 435x with an irregular shape slightly elongated ~E-W, ~25"x20".  A brighter knot at the west end gives the appearance of being double or bipolar.  At 565x the surface brightness is noticeably irregular and an extremely faint "stellaring" was occasionally visible at the west edge and I caught fleeting glimpses of a centrally located star.


17.5" (9/5/99): fairly bright, but small disc picked up at 100x.  Easily takes high power. Nice view unfiltered at 280x - the PN has an irregular surface brightness with a brighter center but no central star and appears slightly elongated WNW-ESE, perhaps 20"-25" in diameter.  At 500x the outer edge of the rim fades and is not sharply defined.  At moments a sparkle was visible at the center with this magnification.  Located 5.0' WSW of mag 9 SAO 143251.


13.1" (8/8/86): bright, fairly small, estimate V = 12.0-12.5.  Very nice view at 214x with a UHC filter and slightly elongated WNW-ESE with a fainter rounder halo suspected.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6778 = m 399 on 25 Jun 1863 and noted "S, E, ill defined whitish disc."  His position was 1.8' to the southwest.  John Herschel made the original discovery on 20 Aug 1825 (sweep 6), though his rough RA was two minutes too large.  But his detailed description confirms the discovery.  Edward Pickering found the planetary in Aug or Sep 1882 at Harvard College Observatory, though he noted the equivalence with GC 5942 [= NGC 6778].


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "the brighter part of the nebula takes an hour-glass shape; is 19"x13"; faint ansae in p.a. 18° bring the total length to 25".  Fainter along the major axis."

24" (8/12/15): superb view at 564x (10mm ZAO + 2.5x Powermate) in excellent seeing and transparency.  This bright globular was highly resolved over the entire large central region and within a straggling, irregular halo that filled the 5' field.  Roughly 100 or more stars were resolved, though it was difficult to judge the extent of the halo as it thinned into the density of the surrounding Milky Way star field.  The unresolved background glow of the halo was more evident on the south side.


17.5" (8/27/87): about 30 stars resolved including many mag 15 stars at 280x.  Resolution is evident over the entire disc and at the edges of the ill-defined halo.  Situated in a rich star field.


13.1" (5/26/84): many faint stars and some brighter stars near the west edge.


13.1" (8/16/82): a number of faint stars resolved, particularly at the west edge.


8" (10/4/80): very grainy, ragged, few faint stars resolved.


80mm (8/27/87): easily visible at 11x.


Charles Messier discovered M56 = NGC 6779 = h2036 on 19 Jan 1779 and described a "nebula without stars, having little light."   Caroline Herschel independently found the cluster on 7 Apr 1783. WH first observed the cluster on 31 May 1783 with his 8-inch and noted it was "all resolved into stars [at high power]."  On 17 Jul 1784 (sweep 239), he recorded "a cl of v compressed stars, nearly R, and about 4' in dia, very accumulated in the middle; L, r."  JH made a number of observations and on 1 Aug 1829 (sweep 198) recorded a "Fine compressed cluster; R, inclining to a triangular form; bM; stars 12...14m. A fine object, diam 3'."  Observing with an 11-inch refractor, Heinrich d'Arrest wrote "a star cluster, which contains a large number of stars, none of which is brighter than 12 to 13th magnitude.  With 356x resolved into minute stars."  R.J. Mitchell, LdR's assistant on 12 Aug 1855, logged "fine cluster, R, centre much compressed; composed of from 10 to 15 st of 13m and many much fainter ones.  A few scattered stars have appearance of rays from the centre."

24" (6/30/16): at 322x and 500x; fairly bright and large, round, just under 2' diameter.  Contains a relatively thick, much brighter rim, except on the north side.  The annulus is unevenly in surface brightness, but brighter along a 180° arc, centered on the side south and dimming gradually but extending ~240°.  This gives the planetary a "C" shape appearance.  The remaining 120° arc, centered on the north edge, is noticeably fainter.  A mag ~13.5 star is at the northeast edge, a mag ~14.5 star is just off the north-northwest edge and a mag 15.5+ star is barely off the south edge.  An extremely faint star is superimposed just north-northeast of center (probably not the central star).


18" (7/14/07): at 225x appeared fairly bright, fairly large, round, perhaps 1.8' diameter.  A brighter rim is evident, particularly along the entire south half and extending for nearly 180 degrees.  The rim is weaker on the north side giving a partial thick "C" or crescent appearance.  A mag 13.5 star is at the northeast edge.


18" (8/14/04): at 225x, appears moderately bright, fairly large, round, at least 1.5' diameter.  A mag 13.5 star is at the NE edge of the rim with a fainter star off the NNW edge.  The rim is clearly brighter, particularly along the entire south side, with the rim fading on the north side giving an asymmetric or crescent appearance. A large central "hole" appears slightly darker.  At 160x, one or possible two extremely faint stars flickered on and off within the interior of the disc but neither appeared to be the central star.


17.5" (6/30/00): at 220x unfiltered this fairly bright PN has a 1.5' round halo.  The rim is brightest and more well-defined along an arc on the south and southeast rim.  The central 45" hole is slightly darker and irregular in surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is at the northeast edge and once or twice I caught a fainter glimmer of an interior star north of center.


17.5" (7/12/99): at 100x appears fairly bright, round, ~1.6' diameter with a darker center.  I used a variety of magnifications and filters but the most interesting view was at 220x using a UHC filter.  With this combination the PN is slightly elongated E-W and clearly brighter along the southern rim with the brightening tapering towards the ends so this brighter portion had a crescent appearance.  Because of this asymmetric rim the darker center seems offset and only weakly brightens at the NW rim.  A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge 1' from center.


17.5" (8/2/86): at 222x and UHC filter; very large, about 1.8' diameter, much brighter on the SW portion of the rim, darker center.  A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge.


13.1" (6/29/84): the rim is brighter mainly on the SW side giving a slightly annular appearance.  A faint star is off the east edge.


13.1" (8/15/82): brighter rim mostly evident on the south side and a darker center just visible at 140x-200x.


8" (7/24/82): large and easily viewed but the annularity was not seen with any certainty.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6781 = H III-743 = h2037 on 30 Jul 1788 (sweep 850) and recorded "cF, irregularly round, 3 or 4' diam, resolvable."  John Herschel made a detailed observation on 15 Aug 1830 (sweep 280): "A most beautiful, vL, F planetary nebula.  Diameter in RA = 6.5 seconds = 1' 37"; its light nearly uniform, only very little hazy at the edge and perhaps rather brighter at the southern limb.  It nature seems to have been overlooked or mistaken by my Father, who has placed it in his third class [Very Faint Nebula].  In Milky Way.  Many stars in field, one 11m near the north-following limb."  On 28 Aug 1850, Lord Rosse (or assistant) described the planetary as "annular or perhaps spiral, star distinctly seen in dark part n of centre, others seen at moments.  The dark space is undoubtedly irr in form."


Johann von Lamont made a sketch on 7 Jul 1837 with the 11" Merz refractor at the Munich Observatory.  William Lassell observed the planetary on Malta with his 48" reflector and made a sketch on 29 Aug 1862.  Another sketch was made around 1877 by Wilhelm Tempel with the 11" refractor at Arcetri Observatory in Florence.  Temple compared his results with Lamont and Lassell. E.E. Barnard described the planetary as annular using the Yerkes 40" refractor in 1899.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "this object is `06" in diameter from east to west, and a little longer than this along a major axis in approximately p.a. 5°.  Exceedingly faint at the north; brightest at east and west edges, and fainter along the major axis.  Indistinct ring structure shown around edges."

NGC 6784A, the southwest component, appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 24"x20".  A mag 15 star is 0.7' SW of center and a ~4" pair of mag 15/15.5 stars is 0.8' N.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6784 = h3790 on 23 Jun 1835 and recorded "eeF; pL; among small stars."  He made three observations (all called "eeF"), but made no reference to it being double.  So, as Harold Corwin notes, its impossible to tell whether he saw one or the other, or both.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6785 = h2038 on 20 Aug 1825 (sweep 6) and made a small diagram in his logbook.  He recorded, "An infinitely small stellar nebula = a star of the 15th mag.  It is in the field with (a) the double star and precedes it.  (b) is a star of 9m half way between (a) and (c) the nebula.  The nebula the angle made with a-b-c with the parallel = 25 or 30°.  Dist [from] c-a = 2/3 diam of field. A most delicate and trying object, but the sky is rather hazy.  Requires verifying."  There is nothing at his rough position (the RA is marked as uncertain) but two minutes of RA directly west is NGC 6778 (discovered again by Marth in 1863), and his sketch and description matches!  In the Slough Catalogue, Herschel erroneously references sweep 5, instead of sweep 6.  This was his first PN discovery and his 5th overall.  Harold Corwin states that Bigourdan's corrected position refers to a close trio of stars.

NGC 6786 forms a close pair with UGC 11415, but the core of UGC 11415 is nearly hidden behind the glow of the mag 12 star close northeast.  A very low surface brightness halo is just visible.  With careful viewing, a small portion of the core is a bit more evident close northeast of the star.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6786 =  Sw. V-90 on 3 Oct 1886 and recorded "eeF; S; R; south-preceding of and near 2 stars."  His position and description is an excellent match.

24" (8/12/15): gorgeous field at 200x (1/2°) using a 13mm Ethos, but this rich cluster was superbly resolved at 200x using a 10mm Zeiss Ortho.  Roughly 100 stars were visible in an irregular oval outline, slightly elongated NW to SE.  The stars are remarkably uniform but slightly brighter along the southeast edge.  Interestingly, a large percentage of the resolved stars form the outline as the center is richer and contains more fainter stars (like a very weakly compressed globular cluster).  A string of stars extends roughly through the center, bisecting the oval and a "void" is created by this string on the southeast interior.  The outline is fairly well-defined, with some brighter field stars beyond, including a couple of mag 10-10.5 stars off the south side and a mag 9.5 star 11' NW of center.  Excellent cluster!


13.1" (9/11/82): fairly faint, moderately large, many faint stars are resolved over haze with averted, low surface brightness.


8" (9/11/82): moderately large, very faint hazy patch like a low surface brightness galaxy, no resolution.


NGC 6791 is one of the very oldest open clusters, along with Berkeley 17, with an age of 8 to 10 Gyr!


Friedrich August Winnecke discovered NGC 6791 = Au 45 in December 1853 with his 2.8-inch Merz refractor.  At the time he was an 18-year old astronomy student at Gottingen University.  He described the cluster (repeated in Auwers' 1862 list of new nebulae) as "very faint; a miniature image of M74", so the cluster was clearly not resolved.  But at Königsberg, Auwers noted that it consisted of many mag 12 stars that appeared nebulous in smaller instruments.  Horace Tuttle independently discovered the cluster on 17 Jul 1859 with a 10-cm comet-seeker at Harvard College observatory (announced in AN 1453).

The core of the cluster contains a 1' triangle of mag 10.5-11 stars with the north vertex a nice double star (h886 = 10.5/11.5 at 8").  Just south is a 1' quadrilateral consisting of four mag 13 stars.  No other distinct groups are in the cluster, although 4' N and 4' E are two small groups of seven and four stars.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6793 = H VIII-81 = h2039 on 18 Jul 1789 (sweep 932) and recorded "a sc. cl. of cL stars, pretty rich, iF, above 15' in extent."  His position is accurate.

Between these stars is an enhancement of mag 12 and 13 stars and a single mag 9 star (SAO 124627).  Appears as a slightly richer group that stands out reasonably well at 100x because of the associated bright stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6795 = h2040 on 24 Aug 1827 and recorded "The first of 3 stars 9m, nearly in parallel, joined by a rich clustering portion of the Milky Way."  His position corresponds with mag 8.3 SAO 124619 at the west end of the group.

Swift probably "rediscovered" this galaxy again on 2 Oct 1891 and catalogued it in list X-47 (later IC 1300), but his declination was in error.


Howe searched unsuccessfully for IC 1300 on two nights at Swift's position and afterwards communicated with Swift, who responded that the IC position was one degree too far south.  This implies IC 1300 = NGC 6798.  In the same letter Swift state that the declination of IC 1301 was 35' greater than given in the IC (see that number).

24" (6/30/16): at 501x (unfiltered): bright, irregular planetary with interesting structure!  The overall shape is roughly oval, extending WSW-ENE, ~0.7'x0.5'.  The 14th magnitude central star is very easy.  A brighter mag 12.5-13 star is along the rim on the northeast side and a fainter mag 14-14.5 star is at the west edge of the rim.  The latter star has a mag 15-15.5 companion 12" SSW.  Also a 10" pair of mag 14/15 stars is off the northeast side.  The rim is brightest along thin 90° strips centered on the southeast and northwest side and weak or open on the southwest side.  Along with the brighter star on the northeast end, this creates a "C" or horseshoe appearance with a darker center.


18" (7/11/07): at 450x this striking planetary appeared elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE, ~60"x45".  Three stars are involved including the 14th magnitude central star.  A mag 12.5-13 star is at the northeast edge of the halo and a mag 14.5 star is at the west edge with a mag 15 companion close southwest.  The surface brightness is irregular; weakest on the southwest side and slightly brighter along the east side, giving a "horseshoe" appearance.


17.5" (7/11/99): at lower powers appears moderately bright, irregularly round, ~1' diameter with several stars involved or nearby.  At 280x, the view is very unusual with three stars involved and others nearby.  The brightest is a mag 12.5-13 star at the NE edge.  The mag 14 central star is visible with direct vision.  Finally, a mag 14.5-15 star is at or just off the west side.  The planetary is slightly elongated 4:3 SW-NE with an irregular surface brightness.  The rim appears brighter along the east and northeast side and weakest at the west edge.  Nearby stars include a mag 13 star ~1.5' NE (nearly on a line with the central star and the star on the northeast edge) and a mag 15-15.5 star close south-southwest of the star at the west edge.


13" (8/5/83): moderately bright, elongated WSW-ENE.  Unusual appearance as four faint stars are very near or involved including the faint mag 14 central star visible with averted vision.  A mag 13 star is at the NE edge 27" from the center, a very faint mag 15 star is at west edge and a similar star is just NW.  The rim is possibly slightly brighter on the east edge.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6804 = H VI-38 = h2043 on 25 Aug 1791 (sweep 1018) and recorded "cB, S, iF, easily resolvable.  Some of the stars visible."  He mistakenly placed this planetary nebula in classification class VI of "Very compressed and rich clusters of stars." John Herschel also assumed it was a cluster, though on his first of four observations (21 Aug 1827), he logged "doubtful if a resolved cl or a neb of first class.  pL; R; bM; 60"; with 2 or 3 accidental stars of the Milky Way."  Confirmed as a planetary by Francis Pease in 1917.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) wrote, "an irregular ring 33" from north to south and 30" from E to W; brightest on north and south and fades out along an axis in p.a. 48°.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6810 = h3797 on 10 Jul 1834 and recorded "B; mE, in position 169.2°; psbM; 90"."  His position is accurate.  On the next sweep he called this object "R; vgbM; 30" haze thickening rapidly."  The second (poorer) description was given in the GC and NGC, and DeLisle Stewart reported (based on plates taken at Harvard's Arequipa Station), "not round, but cF, S, eE 179°, stell ncl."

V = 6.8;  Size 13'


17.5" (7/1/00): large, beautiful cluster at 100x.  The central section is ~8' in diameter, roughly triangular and contains a scattering of ~20 10-11th magnitude stars.  There are no prominent members - the brightest star (at the west edge) has a faint companion.  Perhaps 85 stars are resolved in the unconcentrated central region (there is nearly a void in the center) over haze.  The richest knot of stars is on the northeast side.  An isolated 5' tails of stars extends NW and another curving string of stars can be traced 8' to the east.


13.1" (9/3/83): fairly large and rich group of approximately 60 stars including many mag 11-12 stars.  A long trail of stars follows and a bright group of stars is WNW.  Prominent in 16x80 finder, some resolution with averted.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6811 = h2044 on 29 Aug 1829 and recorded "a double star in the southern part of a fine, large, pretty rich coarse cluster of about 100 stars 11...14m; it fills the field."  His position is near a mag 11 star on the southeast end of the cluster.  The next sweep (2 Sep 1829) he logged "The centre of the more condensed part of a considerable cluster, 10' diameter, of irregularly scattered stars."  His position, though, is about 45 seconds of RA too large.  Harold Corwin mentions "Unfortunately, the position JH adopted for the GC carries the RA of the second, and a Dec 10 arcmin further on north. I think he meant to use only the second observation (he notes that the first observation refers to "A double star in the southern part ..."), so the incorrect Dec must be a transcription or typographical error."  The end result is the GC and NGC position is 15' too far northeast, well outside the confines of the cluster.

25" (4/5/16 - Coonabarabran, 318x): moderately bright oval, elongated ~3:2 E-W, 0.7'x0.45'.  Almost immediately I noticed the shape was either irregular or perhaps there was an attached companion.  On careful examination, an extremely faint, compact companion (LEDA 2802344), 8"-10" diameter, was occasionally resolved (barely separated) or attached to the southwest edge.  LEDA 2802343, a second (easier) companion is just 1.8' WNW.  It appeared very faint and small, round, ~12" diameter.  A number of brighter stars pepper the field including a mag 11 star 2.7' NW, a mag 9.7 star 4.2' NNE and a mag 10.4 star 6' NNW.  Three additional mag 10.5 stars form a small triangle 7' to 8' SSW.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6812 = h3799 on 9 Jul 1834 and recorded "pB ; pmE; glbM; 40" l, 30" br."  His position is accurate.


Pietro Baracchi observed NGC 6812 on 8 Nov 1885 with the Melbourne telescope and wrote "Rather faint, small, pmbM. The center sparkling at times as if a star was in it."  The last comment may refer to LEDA 2802344.  His diagram shows LEDA 2802343 as a very small nebulous object, perfectly placed close WNW of NGC 6812.  It appears to be labeled with an "n" (presumably an abbreviation for "nebula").

18" (7/12/07): picked up at 115x as a small, hazy glow surrounding a mag 13.5 star.  Adding an OIII filter, this emission nebula appeared as a moderately bright, round, 1.5' glow surrounding the star.  At 174x the center "star" appears double and the nebulosity responds well to an OIII filter.  At 225x, the two close central stars are cleanly resolved and a third fainter star is just at the northern edge.  Adding a UHC filter, the shape is irregular and the overall outline shifts with averted vision, though it does not appear to be larger than 1.2'-1.5' visually despite a catalogued diameter of 3'.


17.5" (6/15/91): at 140x, fairly faint emission nebulosity, round, 1.5' diameter.  Surrounds a very close mag 14 double star.  Using an OIII filter the nebulosity is very prominent and increases to 3' in size.  Located 3' SE of mag 9 SAO 87539.

Scattered appearance with no rich sections although over unresolved background haze.  A mag 8 star is off the NW edge.

ESO 460-030 (identified as NGC 6816 in most sources), situated 6' NNE, appeared moderately bright, fairly small, irregularly round, small bright core, faint halo 35" diameter.  Two stars are superimposed; a mag 13.5-14 star at the west edge [15" from center] and a mag 14.5 star [20" NW].  The halo appears to encompass both stars with averted vision.  A bright mag 10.8 star is 1' SW.  ESO 460-033, situated 12' NE, appeared fairly faint, moderately large, slightly elongated WNW-ESE, 0.8'x0.65', broad and weak concentration to a slightly brighter core.


24" (9/29/16): at 375x; fairly faint, elongated 5:3 WNW-ESE, ~40"x24", broad concentration with a brighter core.  A faint star is off the NW edge [Note: there no star here but a compact companion is at the ESE end - probably my directions are reversed].


In a group with ESO 460-030 6' NNE.  This galaxy (usually identified as NGC 6816) appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, small, round, 20"-24" diameter, very small bright nucleus, higher surface brightness than NGC 6816. Two mag 13.5-14.5 stars attached at the west edge interfere a bit and a mag 10.8 star is 1' SW.  ESO 460-025, 15' W, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, ~30"x25", broad weak concentration.  A mag 11.5 star is 1.4' SE.  ESO 460-033, 12' NE, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 4:3 WNW-ESE, moderate concentration to a small bright nucleus.


17.5" (6/8/91): very faint, fairly small, very low surface brightness. Forms an equilateral triangle with two mag 13 stars 2.8' SW and 2.8' SSE of center.  A close mag 14.5 star is 1' NNE (?).  Located 4.5' S of a mag 10.5 star.


Forms a pair with ESO 460-030 = MCG -05-46-006 6' NNE.  ESO 460-030 is identified as NGC 6816 in RNGC, ESO, PGC, NED and HyperLeda.  It appeared very faint, very small, round.  Two mag 13.5 stars at the west and northwest edge confuse the observation as well as a mag 10.8 star 1' WSW that is detracting.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6816 = h3800 on 30 Jul 1834 and recorded "eF; R; vlbM; 40"; a *9m north of it; at 6' distance has what may be easily taken for a nebula attached to it, but it is only a little group of vS stars."  There is nothing his position, which is 4' due south of ESO 460-029 and 9' south-southwest of ESO 460-030.  ESO 460-029 is a better match in position and description -- a mag 10.8 star lies 5' due north along with several other nearby fainter stars.


The question remains that if NGC 6816 = ESO 460-029 how did JH miss brighter ESO 460-030 = PGC 63587?  His description suggests he probably noticed this galaxy or the nucleus of the galaxy ("what may be easily taken for a nebula attached to [the star]") but decided it was part of the group of stars. In the GC, JH shortened his description to read "eF; pS; R; vlbM; * np." The 6' separation to the star was not included and it's not clear why he changed the direction to "np" [northwest].


All modern sources, including RNGC, ESO, RC3, PGC, NED and HyperLeda, misidentify ESO 460-030 as NGC 6816.  I listed this error in RNGC Corrections #5.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

A mag 15.5 star is close north-northeast [26" from center] and a mag 16.1 star lies 39" NW.  The companion galaxy is just off the west side [16" between centers] and extremely to very faint (V = 15.7, B = 16.5), round, only 6"-8" diameter!  On the SDSS the halos of the two galaxies are merged and the brighter eastern component is tidally disturbed.

24" (8/25/19): viewed at 375x, 500x, 644x, and 1000x; easily takes high power due to its high surface brightness and good seeing.  The annular structure, though only moderate contrast, was very interesting with a relatively large, oval darker center and a very irregular, relatively narrow ring with an irregular surface brightness (brighter spots).  The edge was soft in sections with a strong impression of a thin faint halo.


24" (7/19/17): at 375x, 500x, 750x and 1000x: small, very high surface brightness oval, slightly elongated N-S, with a blue color at 375x, takes up to 1000x! The planetary is encased in a thin outer shell.  Occasionally the center seemed to sharpen to a point, but I couldn't confirm the central star with confidence.  The rim seemed to sparkle with slightly brighter regions.  Located 40' N of Barnard's Galaxy (NGC 6822).


18" (7/23/06): this very high surface brightness blue planetary takes high magnification well and 565x provided an excellent view.  Appears slightly elongated N-S, ~20"x15".  Most striking is an annular structure with a brighter rim and darker center.  The rim has an irregular surface brightness and is brighter along the southeast and east side.  Although the contrast of the rim with the darker center is fairly low, the relative thickness of the rim is comparable to M57.  Barnard's Galaxy lies just 40' S.


17.5" (7/12/99): at 100x this striking PN is bright and small with an obvious blue color.  The high surface brightness easily allows high power.  At 380x, there is subtle but obvious structure with a darker center and an irregular brightness to the halo.  Most noticeably the PN is brighter on the east end and mildly annular.  Appears slightly elongated N-S, ~20"x15" in size.  Three mag 13-13.5 stars are nearby at 40" NW, 1.0' E and 1.3' SW.


17.5" (7/16/88): at 412x appears very bright, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, blue color, very high surface brightness.  Appears brighter along the east side and slightly brighter along the west side compared to the center.  Has a darker elongated center but the annularity has a pretty low contrast.  Barnard's galaxy NGC 6822 lies 40' SSE.


13.1" (9/3/83): very bright, slightly elongated N-S, fairly small.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6818 = H IV-51 = h2047 on 8 Aug 1787 (sweep 749) and recorded "a small beautiful planetary nebula, but considerably hazy upon the edges; it is of uniform light throughout, considerably bright.  Perfectly round, 10 or 15" in diameter.  My brother Jacob being in the gallery, I showed it to him."  His position was very accurate.


John Herschel reported that "It is exactly like a planet and two satellites. Distance of A, the nearer, 20", Pos 45° np; of B, 25", 20° nf."  JH was interested in the idea that in some cases PN were accompanied by satellites (NGC 6905 and NGC 7662 are two other examples he mentioned).  Other astronomers, such as Olbers, were also interested in this notion.


On 28 Aug 1850, Lord Rosse (or his assistant) recorded, "vB, blue planetary neb, edges not sharp, a little darker in the middle."  A year later, assistant Bindon Stoney logged "the dark part is a little np middle."  In 1856 Father Secchi noted (and sketched) a darker center in the shape of a cross using a 9.5" refractor at 1000x.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) wrote "A rather irregular oval ring 22"x15" in p.a. 10°, fainter along and at the ends of the major axis. A fainter narrow ring shows at east and west outside of the inner bright ring."


John Mallas coined the nickname "Little Gem" in the Jun/Jul 1963 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebulae-V", published in the "Review of Popular Astronomy". He noted it was "the bluest of the planetaries I have observed."

The cluster extends to ~8' diameter with many faint stars on the SW side.  The outline appears elongated SW-NE with the inner bars of the "U" on the NE border delineating a distinct border.

Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 6819 = h2048 on 12 May 1784.  William didn't record the cluster during his sweeps (though observed it on 31 Dec 1801), so it doesn't carry an H-designation.  Karl Harding independently found it in 1823, reported the discovery to Johann Bode, and it was listed as new in Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1827 (published in 1824).  John Herschel rediscovered it again on 31 Jul 1831 and logged "a beautiful cluster, v rich, vL; stars 11...15m and l = 7m nf, a reticulated mass, central part = 4', but fills field with its loose stars.

17.5" (8/10/91): at 100x using OIII filter, open cluster NGC 6823 is immersed in a faint nebulosity.  Also extends 5'-10' SW from the core of the cluster to a group of stars that wasn't included in the description of NGC 6823.


The observation above refers to Sh 2-86, the usual identification of NGC 6820.  But based on Marth's position and description, NGC 6820 more likely refers to a compact knot to the southwest of the cluster at this position.  At 220x, it appeared as a small, 20" knot surrounding a faint stellar or quasi-stellar core.  Interestingly, this object dimmed with OIII, UHC and H-beta, so it's likely a reflection nebula that is detached from the main mass of nebulosity to the northeast.


13.1" (8/15/82): cluster NGC 6823 is encased in nebulosity (Sh 2-86) using a filter and averted vision.  Very difficult to identify the nebulosity unfiltered.

48" (5/16/12): the four HII regions on the north side of the galaxy were carefully observed.  IC 1308 = Hubble X appeared bright, fairly small, irregularly round.  At ~30" diameter this HII knot is slightly larger than Hubble V and more uniform in surface brightness.  Hubble V is bright, fairly small, irregularly round.  This irregular HII region spans 20"-25" and has a higher surface brightness than IC 1308 3' E.  A bright knot is on the SE end.  Hubble III was immediately visible as a faint to fairly faint glow, fairly large (largest of the four regions), round, ~0.9' diameter.  Occasionally, when the seeing steadied the ring structure popped and a brighter rim and darker center was visible.  Smaller and slightly fainter Hubble I is virtually in contact at the NW edge and sometimes the two glows merged into a single large, irregular glow.  Hubble I is the faintest and westernmost of the main HII regions and appeared as a faint, moderately large, round glow of ~36" diameter, barely off the NW side of larger Hubble III.


18" (8/12/10): under superb conditions at Lassen (8200'), I tracked down Hubble VII, the brightest and oldest globular cluster in Barnard's galaxy, situated near the center of the galaxy.  At 285x, the globular was visible ~50% of the time as an extremely faint (~16th magnitude) and small glow, ~10" diameter.  I couldn't resolve an extremely faint star attached on the SSE edge, but the glow was definitely non-stellar.  I also viewed this challenging object at 393x and it appeared roughly similar in terms of visibility.


18" (7/16/07): very easily picked up at 73x as a very large, low surface brightness glow with no central concentration and extending ~5:2 N-S, ~11x4.5'.  The two HII knots at the north end (IC 1308 and Hubble V) were blinked with an OIII or UHC filter and showed a good response.  Surprisingly the galaxy was quite evident in my 80mm finder at 25x as a faint, elongated glow and it was just at the edge of visibility in my 15x50 IS binoculars.


17.5" (7/14/99): the exact position of the HII ring Hubble III on the NW side of the galaxy was examined carefully at 280x without a filter and on several occasions an extremely faint, round, 15" glow popped into view with averted vision ~1.5' W of a mag 13.5-14 star.  A mag 15.5 star is visible a similar distance SSE of the reference star.  This HII knot was clearly nonstellar, although it didn't have the annular ring appearance seen on images.  Viewed on an evening of exceptional transparency at the Sierra Buttes.


17.5" (5/10/91): at 82x, this Local Group Member appeared fairly faint, very large, low but uneven surface brightness, elongated 5:2 N-S, 14'x6'.  Diffuse appearance and the boundary is difficult to define, requires low power.  Several faint stars are superimposed with a couple of brighter stars on the north side.  Using an OIII filter two small, faint HII knots (Hubble X = IC 1308 and Hubble V) stand out well on the north and NW edges.  Both of these knots are 2' NW of mag 12 stars.  Planetary nebula NGC 6818 lies 40' NNW.


17.5" (7/16/88): easily visible as a large, elongated, low surface brightness glow.


8" (8/28/81): very faint, elongated N-S, similar to a faint Milky Way patch.


E.E. Barnard discovered NGC 6822 on 17 Aug 1884 with either his 5-inch refractor or possibly the 6-inch refractor at Vanderbilt University.  The discovery was announced in Sidereal Messenger, vol 3, p 254.  In AN 2624 he reported "it is some 2' diameter, and very diffuse and even it its light.  With 6-inch equatorial it is very difficult to see, with 5-inch and a power of ~30 (field about 1.25°), it is quite distinct.  This should be borne in mind in looking for it."  Later in 1886 (Sidereal Messenger, vol 5, p 31) he commented "it certainly seems to be much larger and much denser than last year and I certainly think it has increased in density and size since that time." He gave a size estimate of 10' to 15' and concluded "probably this is a variable nebula."


When Max Wolf photographed Barnard's galaxy on 16 Jul 1906 and 8 Aug 1907, he assumed the two brighter HII regions at the north end were NGC 6822 and IC 1308 (the mistake originates from Ormond Stone at the Leander McCormick observatory) and thought the galaxy itself was a new discovery (AN 4207).  Dreyer later catalogued it as IC 4895.  So, NGC 6822 = IC 4895, and one of the two HII knots is left without an IC designation.


Hubble reviewed the historical inconsistencies in his seminal study, "NGC 6822, A Remote Stellar System" (1925ApJ....62..409H) and also made the comment "NGC 6822 is fairly conspicuous in a short 4-inch finder with a low-power eyepiece, but is barely discernible at the primary focus of the 100-inch. The latter, however, shows the bright details which are invisible in the finder."  As far as these "details", Hubble recorded ten non-stellar objects in NGC 6822 that were measured on a 3.5 hour exposure with the 100-inch reflector. Later studies revealed his list included several giant HII regions as well as a couple of clusters.  IC 1308 is generally referred to as Hubble X.  In addition, Hubble discovered 15 variable stars in it including 11 Cepheids. . Using Henrietta Leavitt's relationship between the period and luminosity of Cepheids, Hubble announced NGC 6822 as "the first object definitely assigned to a region outside the galactic system."  Extragalactic astronomy was now firmly established. Modern studies place the distance at 1.6 million light years, making Barnard's Galaxy an isolated member of the Local Group.

17.5" (8/10/91): about 50 stars in the central 5' diameter, bright, moderately large, fairly rich.  Includes four bright mag 9.5-11 stars in a tight group at the core of the cluster plus two or three very faint stars in a 20" diameter.  Most of the stars form a distinctive 5' oval ring, elongated ~E-W.  Emission nebulosity Sh 2-86 (misidentified as NGC 6820 in most sources) is entwined.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6823 = H VII-18 = h2049 on 17 Jul 1785 (sweep 415) and recorded "an elongated cluster of irregularly scattered stars of various sizes, considerably rich; the place taken is that of the brightest part of it, which is towards the south."  JH made the single observation "p rich, irreg R; 5' diam; a cl of loose stars; the chief = 10m, the rest = 11...12.  Four or five in centre [multiple star BD + 22 3782] form a lozenge."

24" (9/16/17): I observed SN 2017glx (Type Ia-91T), discovered on 9/3/17 just 3" W and 2" N of center of NGC 6824.  It was highly suspected at 375x, as the galaxy appeared to have a double nucleus with a superimposed "star" attached on the NW side of the core. It took 500x, though, to clearly confirm and distinguish from the nucleus.  When the seeing steadied, the supernova appeared as a sharp stellar point, perhaps mag 14.5-14.8, superimposed at the NW edge of the small, but nonstellar nucleus.


17.5" (6/8/91): moderately bright and large, 1.5'x1.1', elongated 4:3 SW-NE, bright core with a substellar nucleus, high surface brightness.  A mag 13.5 star is just off the south edge 34" from the center and a pretty yellow/blue double (Stein 2452 = 9.0/11.1 at 15") is 3.5' N.  Unusually bright for a galaxy in a Milky Way field.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6824 = H II-878 on 16 Sep 1792 (sweep 1028) and logged "pB, iF, bM, has 2 stars in it."  CH's reduction is 5' south of UGC 11470, but his description fits.  A change in the PD cord was noted at the end of the short sweep.

Note: The single glow I noted is a merged pair (separation 8"), along with two superimpsed stars, all within a 0.4' clump.


Edward Swift, the 13 year-old son of Lewis Swift, discovered NGC 6825 = Sw. II-82 on 18 Sep 1884 and recorded "eF; vS; F * nr; v diff."  The position is 15 sec of RA east of CGCG 324-001 = PGC 63535.  Bigourdan measured an accurate micrometric position on 30 Aug 1889.  Herbert Howe reported "The *F * nr" is of mag 10, and precedes the nebula 3 sec, 0.5' north.  Two stars of mags 8.5 and 9 are about 5' south following."


NGC 6825 is classified as a multiple galaxy in NED and the DSS2 reveals four nearly stellar objects in a 12" circle, though one or more may be a faint star(s).

19 44 48.1 +50 31 31; Cyg

V = 8.9;  Size 30"


48" (10/27/16): at 610x and 813x; both internal FLIERS (see observation below) were visible on the NW and SE sides of the central disc. The disc had a slight bulge on the northwest and southeast ends creating a slightly elongated, irregular oval NW-SE.  A fainter inner halo was visible at 610x, roughly doubling the size.  At 244x and NPB filter, a third large outer shell was fairly prominent forming a well defined 2' circular halo.


24" (9/13/12): at 325x the main 30" disc appeared slightly brighter in the east-southeast region.  Adding an H-beta filter, a very small knot was sometimes visible near the rim at the east edge.  This difficult knot is prominent on the HST image as a red FLIER (Fast Low-Ionization Emission Region).  The corresponding knot on the west edge was not visible.  The red color of these FLIERS is from ionized nitrogen and it disappeared switching to an OIII filter, although the large outer halo became visible.


24" (8/16/12): at 300x and an OIII or NPB filter, the main high surface brightness disc (slightly elongated) is surrounded by a very faint, fairly uniform giant halo, extending 2' diameter and quadrupling the size of the bright 30" disc!  The outer halo seemed perfectly round with a well-defined edge and was easily visible.


18" (7/17/07): at 500x the "Blinking" Planetary is slightly elongated ~E-W, ~30"x25" with a bright 10th mag central star surrounded by a small, slightly darker annulus.  The disc is pretty evenly lit but slightly weaker on the west or west-southwest side.


17.5" (8/17/01): beautiful view at 500x; the disc is slightly elongated WNW-ESE, with subtle structure.  There is small, slightly darker region around the bright 10th magnitude central star.  The halo appears to dim slightly along the preceding edge and this edge is not as sharply defined.  Located 28' E of the double star 16 Cygni.


17.5": very bright 25" roundish nebula surrounding a bright 10th magnitude central star, slightly elongated ~E-W, high surface brightness.  With direct vision the planetary appears brighter on the south side.  The planetary is too bright with this aperture to have the striking "blinking" effect seen with smaller apertures.


8": the famous "blinking" planetary blinks well with this aperture.  Contains a bright mag 10 central star (HD 186924) visible with direct vision and the outer nebulosity dominates with averted vision.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6826 = H IV-73 = h2050 on 6 Sep 1793 (sweep 1049) and recorded "a beautiful phenomenon.  A bright point, lE, like two points close to one another; as bright as a star of the 8-9 magnitude surrounded by a very bright milky nebulosity suddenly terminated, having the appearance of a planetary nebula with a lucid center.  The border, however, is not very well defined.  It is perfectly round and I suppose about 1/2' in diameter.  It is of a middle species between the planetary nebula and nebulous stars."  JH recorded "a most curious object.  A * 11m surrounded with a vB, perfectly R planetary nebula, of equal light throughout.  Diameter in RA = 3.5 sec.  Perhaps a little hazy at the edges.  With 320x the * is not seen double."


On 28 Aug 1850, Bindon Stoney recorded at Birr Castle, "A very remarkable object, probably analogous to h450 [NGC 2392].  The dark ring is not easily seen, but there can be no mistake about it, seen by Lord R and myself, my brother (George Stoney) saw it dark under [preceding] the central star."  Observing with a 9.5" refractor at 760x in 1856, Father Secchi described (and sketched) the outer halo resolving into a number of small stars and claimed it was an open cluster (AN 43, 157).


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) wrote "The central star...is surrounded by an oval disk of bright matter 27"x24".  Within this are rather obscure evidence of a brighter ring formation, the condensations at the ends of which are 22" apart in p.a. about 125°."  An outer shell of 110" in diameter was first photographed with the 100-inch at Mt Wilson on 13 Aug 1936.  It was looked for after finding an unsuspected outer envelope around M57.


The Herschels never mentioned a blinking effect, though it is less prominent in larger scopes.  In an article titled "Suggestions to Amateurs: Nebulae and Clusters" by Lewis Swift in Popular Astronomy (1894) he mentions, "According to Professor Mitchell, "now you see it, and now you don't".  The blinking effect was noted by James Mullaney and Wallace McCall in the August 1963 issue of Sky & Tel, though the nickname was coined by Mullaney.

Besides these bright stars there is 6' incomplete ring of approximately 50 stars mag 12-14.5 roughly centered on the mag 6.5 star.  The majority of these stars are located in the northern half of the ring.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6828 = H VIII-73 = h2051 on 30 Jul 1788 (sweep 850) and recorded "A coarsely scattered cluster of stars, with a pB one in the center."

24" (9/2/16): at 200x and 375x; beautifully rich cluster mostly defined by an intense triangular central or core region with vertices on the north, southwest and southeast corners and sides ~3', 3' and 2.3'.  Roughly 100 stars are densely packed over the background glow within this triangular outline, though the north end is less well defined.   The surface brightness falls off rapidly outside this core, though the halo includes some brighter stars, and the cluster blends into the fairly rich field density beyond a diameter of 5'.  Open cluster Harvard 20 lies 28' SSW.


17.5" (8/5/94): roughly 75 stars resolved in a 5' diameter but has a very irregular ill-defined outline to the halo.  The brightest section is elongated SSW-NNE with dimensions 3'x2'.  The brightest star is on the east side of the core and is a close double.  Located in a rich field with likely many field stars superimposed around the halo.  Located just south of the midpoint between Gamma and Delta Sagittae.


Harvard 20, less than 30' SSW, contains about three dozen stars in a 6'x3' field, elongated ~E-W.  Two bright mag 9 stars are off the west side but the cluster is dominated by 20 mag 12/13 stars.  Also includes a scattering of faint mag 14-15 stars.  A pretty evenly matched mag 12.5/12.5 double star is at the east end and an uneven mag 12/14 double star is to the west of the well matched double.


13.1" (7/16/82 and 8/22/87): a few dozen stars are resolved over haze, only weakly concentrated, non-symmetrical shape.  Impression that many faint field stars may be superimposed.  Located in a very rich star field.


8" (10/4/80): many faint stars were resolved with averted.  The west edge is brighter.


15x50mm IS binoculars (6/19/09): bright, obvious glow is elongated with a brighter center.


Philippe de Chéseaux discovered M71 = NGC 6838 = h2056 in 1745-46.  Johann Koehler independently rediscovered it between 1772 and 1779 with a 6-foot Dollond telescope at only 30x and noted "a very pale nebulous patch in the Arrow [Sagitta]."  Pierre Méchain found it again on 28 Jun 1780 and he is credited with the discovery in the NGC.


WH first observed the cluster on 30 May 1783 using his 8-inch (10-ft focal length) and noted it was "resolved into stars.  I can count between 20 and 30 of them."  He viewed it several times in his larger scopes and logged "a very compressed cl of stars." on 18 Aug 1784 (sweep 252) and "a cl. of stars; the stars pretty large, nf is a part seemingly separated" on 18 Sep 1784 (sweep 276).

More noticeable, though, is a partially resolved clump of faint stars just 3' NW.  At 225x this fairly rich clump is resolved into 15 mag 13.5-14.5 stars in a 3' region elongated NNW-SSE.  There are also scattered mag 10-12 stars to the southeast of SAO 105398 but these don't catch the eye.  Located 50' S of M71.  The identification of this number is very uncertain.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6839 = H VI-16 = h2057 on 18 Aug 1784 (sweep 252) and noted as "a very small cl of compressed stars."  There is nothing of special interest near his position.  JH made two observations and described (sweep 92) "an insignificant bunch of little stars in the milky way.  Hardly more marked than the general mass, which is astonishingly rich here" and "A quantity of Milky Way stars, immensely close, one small patch of which may be the cluster VI 16."  (Repeats his father's position with +/- signs in sweep 362).  So, the identification is quite uncertain and WH's intended group of stars may be lost.

24" (9/1/16): at 375x and 500x (unfiltered); moderately bright and large, round, ~50" diameter, crisp edge to the rim, fairly evenly illuminated.  The mag 15.5-16 central star was visible, along with several nearby stars; a mag 15.5 star is just off the NE edge [38" from center], a mag 15 star is off the south edge [47"] and a mag 14 star is off the east edge [50"].  Using 220x with a UHC filter, the planetary is fairly bright and the rim appears slightly brighter in sections.


18" (8/26/06): a sketch was made at 435x showing the numerous faint stars that huddle nearby this planetary.  A mag 14 star is off the east edge [50" from center] and a mag 14.5 star is just off the south end [47" from center].  A mag 15-15.5 star is barely off the NE edge [38" from center] and an extremely faint mag 16 star is at the NNW edge. A mag 13.5 star is 1.1' SE.  Finally a very faint central star is often visible.


17.5" (8/7/91): fairly bright, moderately large, irregularly round, soft edges.  A very faint mag 15.5 central star is visible and a second extremely faint mag 16.0 star is near the east edge.  Several stars are at the edges including a mag 15-15.5 star at the NE edge and two mag 13-14 stars off the east side.  Appears brighter around the central star.


13.1" (7/12/86): at 62x and OIII filter appears moderately bright, moderately large, estimate V = 13.0.  A mag 14.5 star is off the east edge.  NGC 6834 lies 38' WNW.


8" off-axis mask (7/28/19): at 107x; very faint but definite unfiltered as a fairly small (~45"), roundish glow.  Visible with direct vision when I added a NPB filter.


8" (9/81): I was surprised to glimpse NGC 6842 from home in El Cerrito (limiting mag of 4.5) using a Daystar 300 filter at 125x, even with black hood, averted vision and concentration.  Walter Scott Houston wrote about this observation in detail in his Deep Sky Wonder's column of November 1982.


8" (7/31/81): extremely faint, fairly small, diffuse.  Located in a rich star field.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6842 = m 403 = Sf 43 on 28 Jun 1863 and noted "vF, pL, R."  Heinrich d'Arrest independently discovered it the following year on 26 Aug 1864 while searching for William Herschel's H. II-202 = NGC 6847.  Truman Safford found the planetary again on 12 Jul 1866 with the 18.5-inch Clark refractor at Dearborn Observatory.  See NGC 6847.


In 1919, Heber Curtis reported it was undoubtedly a planetary nebula based on a Crossley photograph and described it as "Very faint. It is about 50" x 45", showing traces of an irregular ring formation. It has a central star of about the 13th magnitude."

17.5" (9/23/95): A very unimpressive scattered group of about two dozen stars mag 11-14 in a 8' region.  Generally elongated N-S in a string with a separate line of six stars at the north end oriented E-W.  There is one close isolated double star and the fainter stars are at the south end of the string.  Appears to be a very weak asterism of no special interest except follows NGC 6840 by ~10' in the same field, a better asterism.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6843 = h2059 on 29 Jul 1829 and recorded (single observation) "A poor, small cluster. The following of two [with NGC 6840], just alike."  Karl Reinmuth stated "no distinct Cl, milky way." in his photographic survey and RNGC classifies the number as nonexistent.

25" (10/21/17 - OzSky): at 244x and 397x; NGC 6845A is the largest member in this compact interacting quartet, in a southwest/northeast string.  It appeared moderately bright, elongated ~4:3, only a broad weak concentration. The shape was noticeably curved or irregular on the southwest side.  Images show this is the root and beginning of a tidal arm that curves east and connects to NGC 6845B.  Located 9.6' SE of mag 8.8 HD 189059.


NGC 6845B, just 1.4' NE, appeared very faint, very small, slightly elongated, 15"-20" diameter.  NGC 6845C, centered 0.9' SSW, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated 4:1 NW-SE, 40"x10", small bright core, fairly high surface brightness (highest of the quartet).  NGC 6845D, 1.8' SW, appeared extremely faint, elongated NNW-SSE, ~15'x10" NNW-SSE, requires averted.


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest component of a compact interacting quartet.  At 128x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, oval 3:2 SSW-NNE, 1.0'x0.7', very weak concentration.  Two companions are resolved - NGC 6845B at 1.4' NE (at the end of a long tidal tail) and NGC 6845C at 0.8' SW.


NGC 6845B required averted vision and appeared extremely faint and small, round, 0.3' diameter, very low surface brightness.  NGC 6845C appeared very faint, small, very elongated 4:1 NW-SE, 0.6'x0.15'.  On the DSS image, faint tidal plumes appear to connect NGC 6845A with this companion.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6845 = h3803 on 7 Jul 1834 (sweep 467) and recorded "eF; lE; glbM; 30"."  In a second observation he logged "vF; R; bM; 15".  Found and viewed by the place of sweep 467."  This is a compact interacting group of four galaxies (Klemola 30) and RC3 identifies the brightest member as NGC 6845A.


The entire quartet was found during an examination of Bruce plates taken at Arequipa, Peru between 1908 and 1913.  The individual members were catalogued in a list by Solon Bailey of 1659 new nebulae in the 1913 Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College, Vol. 72.

A mag 13.5 star is off the NW edge, a mag 14 star is at the west edge and three additional mag 14 stars in a clump are just visible over of the haze although clean resolution is difficult.


K 4-41, an extremely faint stellar planetary is situated just 2' NE!  It wasn't visible without a filter, even using the ESO-Strausberg finder chart.  But adding an OIII filter iI was able to glimpse it several times about 15" S of a mag 14 star.  Appears stellar and estimate V = 16.0-16.5.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6846 = St V-4 on 17 Aug 1873 and recorded "eF, vS, surrounds 3 faint stars."  At his position is a small knot or cluster of faint stars.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6847 = H II-202 on 17 Jul 1784 (sweep 239) and recorded "a resolvable nebulous patch; there are great numbers of them in this neighborhood like forming nebula, but this is the strongest of them; they are evidently congeries of small stars."  There is nothing that stands out on the DSS near his position and Dreyer commented that "according to Bigourdan there is no second class nebula here; a region rich in stars, but if there is any nebulosity about, it is very diffused." (1912 revision of WH's catalogues)


Harold Corwin suggests that H II-202 may apply to the "cluster and HII region [Sh 2-97] 1 degree north and 30 seconds west of Herschel's single position.”  Alternatively, William Herschel's position is 2.0 minutes of RA east of NGC 6842.  Could WH have observed this planetary nebula?  Wolfgang Steinicke suggests this identification.

Two mag 13 stars 1' NE and 1.5' SE of center run parallel to the major axis!  Forms a trio with ESO 185-053 9' NNE and ESO 185-054 10' NE in the core of cluster ACO S840.  On the DSS, a prominent dust lane bisects the galaxy.


ESO 185-054 is moderately bright and large, elongated 4:3 NW-SE, 1.3'x1.0', broad concentration.  A mag 13 star is just off the south edge, 1.1' from center. This galaxy appears slightly brighter than NGC 6848, which lies 10' SW, so it's curious that JH missed it.  ESO 185-053, just 3.6' to the west, appeared faint, small, edge-on 4:1 NNW-SSE, 0.6'x0.15'.

24" (6/30/16): at 501x (unfiltered); very bright compact planetary, fairly small, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~25"x21".  A darker center and bright knots in the rim give a bipolar annular appearance. A very small bright knot is at the southeast end, close to a mag 14.4 star that is just off the edge [22" from center].  A matching knot (slightly less contrasty) is along the northwest edge of the rim.  A mag 13 field is less than 30" W of this knot.  The rim is slightly weaker on the southwest and northeast sides (the south edge is not well defined), so in effect a darker strip or bar extends through the center in a SW-NE orientation, nearly slicing the planetary into two sections.


18" (8/26/06): at 435x, this planetary appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~25"x18".  A mag 14.5 star is close off the SE end.  At this magnification the planetary was occasionally bipolar with a well-defined, very small bright knot just NW of the mag 14.5 star and a second less defined knot that forms the NW end of the planetary.  The two knots appear resolved though I never had a steady view of both simultaneously.  Located less that 5' ENE of a mag 7.5 star.

With careful viewing, ~10 superimposed stars can be counted including the easy mag 14 central star.

Large fainter sweeping side lobes fill in the dumbbell and reverse the major axis to WNW-ESE. The planetary has an irregular surface brightness with a darker center.  At high power 5 or 6 stars are superimposed including the easy mag 13.8 central star.  Overall, this is the most impressive planetary.


8" (9/25/81): central star visible at 200x. The fainter side lobes are prominent.


15x50 IS binoculars (multiple dates): easily the most prominent planetary visible in binoculars.


Charles Messier discovered M27 = NGC 6853 = h2060 on 12 July 1764.  This was the first planetary nebula discovered.  Caroline Herschel independently found it on 30 Sep 1782, her second night of sweeping.  William Herschel reported "My sister discovered this nebula this evening in sweeping for comets; on comparing its place with Messier's nebulae we find it is his 27. It is very curious with a compound piece; the shape of it though oval as M. [Messier] calls it, is rather divided in two; it is situated among a number of small stars, but with this compound piece no star is visible in it. I can only make it bear 278. It vanishes with higher powers on account of its feeble light. With 278 the division between the two patches is stronger, because the intermediate faint light vanishes more."  This discovery may have spurred WH to search for new nebulae.


On 19 Jul 1784, William Herschel recorded "The nebula in Vulpecula I suppose to be a double stratum of stars of a very great extent.  The ends next to us are not only resolvable nebulosity, but I really do see very many of the stars mixt with the resolvable nebulosity; farther on the nebulosity is but barely resolvable and ends at last in milky whitishness of the same appearance as that in Orion.  The idea I form of the shape of the nebula is ...[diagram follows]."


Lord Rosse's sketch from 21 Sep 1843 with his 36" was published in his 1844 PTRAS paper.  He noted "Cannot say positively whether resolvable, but see through it an immense number of stars apparently united with nebulous matter.  If they are stars seen through the neb and unconnected with it, it is strange they should be so much more numerous than in the adjoining part of the heavens." George Johnstone Stoney's sketch (started on 9 Sep, finished on the 16th) was published in the 1850 PT paper (figure 17).  Bindon Stoney's sketch, with several superimposed and nearby stars, was based on micrometrical measurements and included in the 1861 monograph (figure 43).  On 29 Aug 1854 during a return to Birr Castle, George Johnstone Stoney wrote a long note: "Both Dr. Robinson and I agreed that the beard of faint nebulosity extended farther down [sp?] than in my brother's drawing..."


As far as the nickname "Dumbbell" nebula, John Herschel wrote on 24 Aug 1827 "A most extraordinary object; vB; an unresolved nebula, shaped something like an hour-glass, filled into an oval outline with a much less dense nebulosity.  The central mass may be compared to a vertebra or dumb-bell".  In another sweep he describes the shape as "like a double-headed shot or a dumb-bell."

Size 1.0'x1.0'


18" (7/14/07): at 174x and OIII filter appears as a small but high surface brightness nearly circular knot, just 1' in diameter and sharply defined in a very rich star field.  Without a filter a mag 13 (illuminating?) star is visible at the center and two stars are at opposite edges (SW and NE).  At 280x the outline surface brightness is slightly irregular.  Located just inside a beautiful partial ring or loop of stars that includes a couple of double stars.  While viewing this object I noticed a fairly large, 3' low surface brightness hazy region about 10' W in the field.  This glow matches the location of Sh 2-99 (11' W of NGC 6857).  There was no structure to this HII region and the surface brightness was uniform.


18" (9/25/06): easily swept up at 115x as a small, high surface brightness nebula, roughly 1' in diameter, situated in a rich star field.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears quite bright with this combination.  At 300x, the nebula appears as a 1'-1.5' bright glow that spreads out mostly to the south of an embedded (possibly illuminating) mag 13.5-14 star in an irregular shape.  This HII region is located along one side of a near equilateral triangle of mag 12-13 stars with a mag 12 star just 40" SW.  A close, faint equal pair of mag 13.5 stars follows by 4'.


17.5" (8/7/91): very bright, moderately large, about 1' diameter, irregular outline, roughly circular but edges difficult to define, irregular surface brightness.  The mag 13.5 central star is quite prominent offset north of center. Surrounded by four fours; a mag 12 star at the SW edge [40" from center], two mag 13 stars off the NE end [40" from center] and off the NW end [52" from center], a mag 14 star at the SE end.  Located in a rich star field.  Excellent contrast gain with OIII filter.  Extremely faint nebulosity may extend to the west.  This is a compact HII region within Sh 2-100, which mainly spreads out towards the west.  CGCG misclassifies as a planetary nebula.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6857 = H III-144 = h2062 on 6 Sep 1784 (sweep 258) and recorded "a patch containing some nebulosity.  240 confirmed it, irregularly long."  John Herschel made 3 observations and wrote on 1 Aug 1829 (sweep 198), "a nebulous looking patch; 12" diam; in Milky Way; ill-defined; perhaps only some extremely minute stars mixed with larger which as distinct."  This nebula wasn't found (one attempt) at Birr Castle.

17.5" (9/23/95): this is an elongated group of 35 stars in a 10'x4' group oriented N-S which precedes a mag 9 star at 20 03 16 +11 16.4 (2000).  Fairly uniform in brightness and distribution with no dense spots but includes a couple of nice doubles.  Most stars are mag 12-13 with a scattering of fainter stars.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6858 = h2061 on 29 Jul 1829 and recorded "A pretty rich oblong cl; 10' l, 5' br; stars equal and of 13th mag.  In Milky Way.  Place that of double * [HJ 1466."  The visual appearance is similar to JH's description and his position is fairly accurate, so the identification is definite.


Karl Reinmuth described its photographic appearance as "a very loose clustering of st 13...., no distinct cluster."  Jack Sulentic stated "No cluster" in the RNGC and classified the number as nonexistent (Type 7).

George Bond discovered NGC 6859 = HN 6 = Au 46 on 24 Nov 1852 with the 15-inch Merz refractor during the Harvard Zone Survey of stars near the celestial equator.  He noted a "faint nebula follows star #11 [10th mag] by 1 sec [of time] and north of it by 1' 29" north of it."  Dreyer (at Birr Castle), d'Arrest and Schönfeld only reported finding faint stars.  At Bond's precise offset are two mag 12.6/14.0 (12" separation) stars with a third mag 15 star ~16" east.

There was a hint of a dust lane.  Two 12th mag stars are 1.6' NE and 2' E of center.  NGC 6861D, located 14' NE, appeared fairly bright, fairly large, very elongated 3:1 NNW-SSE, ~1.6'x0.5', strong concentration with a very bright elongated core and a stellar nucleus.  A mag 10.4 star is 1.2' W.  NGC 6861 is one of the two brightest members (along with NGC 6868) of the Telescopium Group = ACO S851.


18" (7/7/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, 1.3'x0.8', fairly well concentrated with a small brighter core.  Forms the SW vertex of a triangle with two equal mag 12 stars just 1.6' NE and 2' E.  IC 4943 was viewed 8.5' W and probably NGC 6861D 14' NE but then clouds moved in and ended the observation.


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this galaxy appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 NW-SE with a brighter core.  Two nearby mag 12 stars, 1.6' NE and 2.0' E run parallel to the major axis of the galaxy.  Brightest of four galaxies in field with IC 4943 8.5' W, NGC 6861B 14' SW and an anonymous galaxy 2.8' N of IC 4943.  This is one of the brighter galaxies in the Telescopium Group = ACO S851.


8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): faint, small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, bright core.  Forms the western vertex of an isosceles right triangle with two stars following [mag 12 star 1.6' NE and mag 12.5 star 2.0' E].  NGC 6868 lies 25' E.  Brightest along with NGC 6868 in a group including IC 4943 8.5' W (not seen).


James Dunlop discovered NGC 6861 = D 425 = h3811 on 30 Jul 1826 and recorded "a very small faint nebula, about 15" diameter."  His published position was roughly 1 degree too far north of this galaxy, but Glen Cozens found he made a 1° error in transcribing his original position.  Once corrected, Dunlop's position is 6' too far northwest.


On 7 Jul 1834, John Herschel recorded "B; S; lE; pgmbM; 20"."  On a second sweep he called it "B; S; E; gpmbM; 25" dia.  If a misprint of 42° 12' instead of 41°12' be presumed in Mr. Dunlop's catalogue, this object is identified with No. 425." John Herschel's mean position from two observations matches ESO 233-032.


Lewis Swift found this galaxy again on 8 Jul 1897 (Sw. XI-189) so it also carries the designation IC 4949.  Swift's position was 3' too far north and he apparently he missed the earlier observation by Herschel.  So, NGC 6861 = IC 4949.  See Corwin's identification notes.

17.5" (9/23/95): at 225x five mag 14-15 stars are resolved within a 1' region.  Detached in field and nebulous at low power but unimpressive at high power. Appears fully resolved and just an asterism though may be a possible "open cluster remnant".  There are no brighter stars within the 20' field at 225x.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6863 = h2065 on 25 Jul 1827 and recorded "A little compact knot of 7 or 8 stars taken at first for a nebula (and liable to be taken as one hereafter). Stars 19m."  There is a knot of four faint stars within 35" of JH's position (see visual description).  Karl Reinmuth, in his 1926 photographic survey "Die Herschel-Nebel", describes "4-5 vS st alm in line 85d; *14 n nr." and Harold Corwin also identifies this as a group of 8 stars.  Moni et al (2010, A&A, 510, 44) conclude this is not a cluster but a random enhancement of field stars.

17.5" (7/14/93): bright, moderately large, 3' diameter, round, very bright striking core 30" diameter, very mottled.  Several extremely faint 15th mag stars pop in and out of view with averted vision in the outer halo.  A mag 14 star is in the inner region just NE of core.  The cluster almost reaches four mag 12.5-13 stars, which cradle the globular on the south and NE sides, and a fainter star is off the NW side.  This cluster is quite concentrated and is the only Shapley-Sawyer class I globular in the Messier catalogue.


13.1" (8/25/82): bright intense core surrounded by a fainter halo that is slightly mottled but with no obvious resolution.


15x50 IS binoculars (9/26/11): easily picked up as a very small, round glow with a bright, nearly stellar center and a small fainter halo.


Pierre Méchain discovered M75 = NGC 6864 = h2064 on 27 Aug 1780 and confirmed by Messier in Oct.  WH found "some of the stars are visible."  On 3 Sep 1831 (sweep 369), JH recorded "vB; R; vsvmbM; 2'; a bright R ball 15" diam, in an atmosphere 2'; 320 does not show the stars but makes it more resolvable."

17.5" (9/7/91): about 100 stars in a 20'x10' region are visible at 100x.  Appears rich and very appealing.  The main string is very elongated roughly E-W and contains a brighter intersecting subgroup 8'x2' NW-SE of about 45 stars with a close triple star on the NW end consisting of a mag 10 star and two very faint companions.  Two mag 10-10.5 stars are at the SE end of this string.  The western end of the main string curves north into a nice semi-circle.


Caroline Herschel discovered NGC 6866 = H VII-59 = h2066 on 23 Jul 1783.  William Herschel probably found the cluster on 16 Oct 1783 (before his sweeps).  On 11 Sep 1790 (sweep 959) he rediscovered the cluster (unaware of the previous observations) and logged, "a very rich cl of L stars, considerably compressed, above 15' diam.  By the size of the stars, it is situated among the milky way towards us."  His position is accurate.  Karl Harding found the cluster again in 1823, reported it to Johann Bode and it was listed as new (#8) in Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1827 (printed in 1824).  John Herschel made the single observation on 21 Aug 1829: "a coarse rough cluster.  Taken for VII. 59, but the place does not agree."  His position is on the double star HJ 1478 = 10.3/10.9 at 2.2", which is situated  10' south of the cluster.


Brian Skiff found the Lund catalogue has a -10' error in declination, and this error may be carried over into over sources (misplotted on the Millennium Star Atlas).

18" (9/26/11): bright, large, rich cluster but not isolated in the field, so the catalogued diameter of 20' seems somewhat arbitrary.  At 175x, roughly 200 stars are visible within the region, though there are really too many to count.  The dominant feature are two bright multiple stars near the center: SHJ 314 = 6.8/7.3 at 35" with 4 faint companions and SHJ 315 = 7.9/8.8 at 20" with 8 companions including a trio of mag 11 stars close west, a 15" pair of mag 10.5 stars close east and a tight string of 3 or 4 fainter stars close southeast.  NGC 6871 forms a close pair of clusters with Biurakan 1 (centered on a mag 7.3 star), just off the southeast side.  The little-known Wolf-Rayet shell surrounding W-R 134/135 lies 45' NE.


13.1" (8/25/84): dominated by two bright multiple stars: SHJ 314 = 6.8/7.3 at 35" with four additional close companions and SHJ 315 = 7.9/8.8 pair at 20" surrounded by several mag 11 stars.  The bright pairs are oriented N-S and separated by about 2'.  The cluster itself is in a bright, rich field with no apparent boundaries.


8" (6/81): two sets of multiple stars in a very rich field including ß440 = mag 7, 12, 11, 9.5, 11.5, 8 at 7", 11", 11", 28" and 36".  Located 13' SW of a mag 5.5 27 Cygni.


Wilhelm Struve discovered NGC 6871 = h2067 in 1825 or 1826 using the 9.6" refractor at the Dorpat Observatory and included the double star ∑2630 in his main catalogue of double stars.  On 5 Aug 1831, JH recorded "A double star ∑2630, in a cluster of 5 bright and many small stars."  His position is near the two bright double stars in the center of the cluster and he credited Struve with the discovery.


But by analyzing William Herschel's early "reviews" of bright stars (before his systematic sweeps), which resulted in the discovery of many double stars, Wolfgang Steinicke found (email Oct '16) that Herschel first discovered the cluster on 23 Sep 1783 using his 6.2" reflector.

30" (10/13/15 - OzSky): NGC 6872 is a remarkably stretched spiral with extremely distended arms spanning roughly 750,000 light years.  At 303x it appeared very bright, fairly large, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 1.2'x0.7', sharply concentrated with a bright core encasing an extremely bright nucleus.  A mag 10.4 star is off the west side of the halo, just 1.1' WSW of center.  The initial portions of the spiral arms are visible as thin, very low surface brightness wings, extending ~1' southwest on the south side and northeast on the north side.  The tidal extensions were not seen.  A mag 13 star lies 2.4' ENE.  IC 4970, an interacting companion 1.1' N of center, appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 0.4'x0.25', contains a very small bright nucleus.


18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): second brightest in the Pavo-I Group with brightest member NGC 6876.  Moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE in the direction of a mag 10.4 star 1.1' WSW of center, ~1.2'x0.6', broad concentration with a brighter core.  Interacting with IC 4970 at 1.1' N just outside the halo while fainter PGC 64439 lies 4.0' SE.  Other members of the group include NGC 6876, NGC 6877, NGC 6880.


IC 4970 appeared faint, very small, slightly elongated, 20"x15".  Images reveal a distorted bridge and plumes due to interaction with NGC 6872.  PGC 64439, nearly at the midpoint of NGC 6872 and NGC 6876, appeared very faint and small, round, 0.3' diameter, low surface brightness.


18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright, elongated 2:1 SW-NE towards a mag 10.5 star off the SW edge, 1.2'x0.5'.  Fairly well concentrated with a small bright core.


In 1979A&A, 79, 22, the abstract for "NGC 6872 - A remarkable barred spiral" states, "The extent of the arms is probably greater than in any other spiral known; it is concluded that NGC 6872 is a conventional barred spiral in which severe tidal interaction took place."


John Herschel discovered NGC 6872 = h3816 on 27 Jun 1835 and recorded "F; R; glbM; 30"; has a vS * preceding.  first of 4 [with NGC 6876, 6877 and 6880]."  On a second observation he called it "F; E; 40" l; has a * 9m 10.5 seconds preceding."

20 07 13 +21 06 06; Sge


24" (9/9/18): excellent low power field (centered on STF 2631) at 124x but nothing resembling a cluster was evident.  STF 2631 (8.1/9.1 at 4.5"), a striking orange/light blue pair, is at the eastern vertex of a distinctive pentagon-shaped asterism (roughly 5'x3.5') that includes two mag 9.5 stars.  There are only few stars in the interior of this pentagon.


17.5" (8/25/95): fairly rich region but there is no noticeable clustering.  There is a 15' string starting from the mag 10 star at the NGC position heading due west and ending at the bright double STF 2631 = 8.4/9.8 at 4.6".  This star is very possibly the double referred to in John Herschel's description with a 1.0 tmin error in RA -- Corwin concurs.


17.5" (7/7/94): the low power field (100x using 20 Nagler) surrounding the pretty double star Theta Sagittae = STF 2637 (6.5/9.0 at 12") includes several bright stars but appears too sparse to be a cluster.  But 5' NE of Theta is a neat elongated group of 15 stars mag 12-13 forming a "?" asterism about 6' in length.  Theta Sagittae is located 1.7 tmin east and 11' S of Herschel's position so this identification is less likely than the one given above.


Wilhelm Struve discovered NGC 6873 = h2068 in 1825 or 1826 using the 9.6" refractor at the Dorpat Observatory and catalogued the principal double star ∑2631 in his main catalogue of double stars.  On 5 Aug 1831, JH recorded "A double star the chief of a coarse straggling group of stars 10...13m, hardly entitled to be called a cluster."  He credited Struve with the discovery, though his position (copied into the GC and NGC) is exactly 1.0 minute of RA east of the double star (∑2631 = 8.4/9.8 at 4.6").  Coincidentally, his position falls very close to a wide 1.1' pair of mag 10/11 stars.  Reinmuth called this "a dense region; no Cl; double star 11.8 in Dreyer's place."  He may have examined the erroneous NGC position.

The brightest mag 10 star lies at the east end and most stars are between mag 12-13.  Only stands out at low power due to large size.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6874 = H VIII-86 = h2069 on 15 Sep 1792 (sweep 1027) and recorded "A coarsely sc. cl. of L st, of a rectangled triangular shape."

24" (9/2/16): picked up at 200x unfiltered as a slightly soft, pale blue "star".  Excellent response to an OIII filter.  A slightly brighter 12th mag star is 1.4' SW, though with the filter the planetary dominates this star.  Improved view at 286x and 375x.  A small 5" disc is easily resolved.  Nearby a mag 13.5 star is 50" WNW and a mag 14 star 50" SSE.  At 500x, a 15-15.5 mag star is just off the north side (15" separation) and another 15th mag star is 30" SSE.  The center is brighter but the seeing wasn't steady enough to resolve the central star.


17.5" (9/5/99): picked up at 100x with OIII blinking as a mag 12 "star" by star hopping from the double star ∑2634 = 7.9/9.4 at 5" which is 14' SW.  A good comparison star for blinking is situated just 1.5' SW.  At 280x, the PN has a slight bluish tinge with a "soft" edge.  At 380x, a very disc ~4" is resolved with a brighter center.  The disc is easier at 500x and a mag 16 star is occasionally visible at the north edge.


13" (7/85): observation from El Cerrito: stellar planetary at all powers, confirmed by OIII blinking, estimate V = 12.0.  A similar mag 12 star is 1.4' SW.  Located 14' NE of ∑2634 = 7.9/9.4 at 5".


Edward Pickering discovered NGC 6879 = HN 55 on 8 May 1883 using a direct-vision spectroscope with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard College Observatory.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer (probably in 1885) and not published until 1908 (Harvard Annals 60).  Ralph Copeland independently rediscovered it on 9 Sep 1884 at Dun Echt, Aberdeen using an objective-prism with a 6.1-inch Simms refractor.  He remarked "equal in brightness to a star 10.2 mag.  Diameter 4.6" by micrometric.  It has an 11 mag star at 222.27°, distance 83.2"."  His micrometric position in Monthly Notices XLV 2 is very accurate.  Both Pickering and Copeland are listed as discoverers in the NGC.  Sherburne Burnham described it in 1911 at Yerkes as resembling an out of focus star of of mag 10.7 and he measured a diameter of 3.7".


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) wrote "A minute disk, 5" in diameter, just distinguishable from a star.  Fades out slightly at the edges."

17.5" (9/7/91): conspicuous subgroup at the NW corner of NGC 6885.  About 15 stars in a tight 2' knot with three close brighter stars on the west side, over unresolved haze.  Sprays of stars forming the outline of NGC 6885 seem to radiate from this group.  NGC 6682 and NGC 6885 appear as one cluster at low power.  It's very possible that NGC 6882 = H VIII 22 is a duplicate observation of NGC 6885 and does not refer to a distinct object.  In that case, this subgroup would be identified as Cr 416.  See Corwin's NGCBUGS for story.


8" (8/23/84): in the field of NGC 6885 to the north with a mag 7 star surrounded by five faint stars.  Two additional mag 7 stars are nearby.


William Herschel found NGC 6882 = H VIII-22 on 10 Sep 1784 (sweep 263) and recorded "a cl. of coarsely scattered stars." There is nothing at his position, but ~15' south is NGC 6885 = H VIII-20, which WH discovered just the previous night!  Corwin suggests that WH made two observations of this cluster and made an error with the dec on the second night.  Brent Archinal concurs with this solution. So, NGC 6882 = NGC 6885.  NGC 6882 is often taken as a richer subgroup on the NW side of NGC 6885.

18" (10/8/05): at 115x, 60 stars over haze are visible in a 6' group that is set in an incredibly rich Milky Way field.  Five of the brighter stars on the south side form an elongated "Y" or "Wishbone" asterism with a bright pair of mag 9.5/10 stars (17" separation) at the base of the wishbone.  The west side of the cluster is defined by a gently curving string of 10 faint stars.  At 220x, up to 80-90 stars can be counted in an 7'x5' region as a number of faint stars emerge from the background.  At low power this region is surrounded by other concentrations or asterisms including Ruprecht 172, which spreads out to the southeast.  About 30' NW is the WR 134/135 Nebula, an uncatalogued but relatively bright Wolf-Rayet shell nebula.


17.5" (8/19/95): two dozen stars in a 4' diameter surrounding a prominent "Y" asterism of five mag 10 stars with twenty additional mag 13-14.5 stars.  The brightest star at the base of the "Y" is a mag 9.5/10 double at 17" and the center star about 1.5' NE is an unequal closer pair.  Surrounding this group is a oval border of 7' diameter consisting of several strings of mag 13 stars, which increase the total to roughly 50 stars.  Appears to be an asterism in a rich Milky Way field and best view at 100x.  Attached to Ruprecht 172.


8" (8/15/82): elongated string of stars N-S, moderately large, over background haze.  Situated in a very rich star field and difficult to identify.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6883 = h2070 on 19 Aug 1828 NGC 6883 and recorded "a double star in a cluster of a good many stars 10...13m."   Dreyer, the observing assistant at Birr Castle on 23 Aug 1876, simply noted "rich field, no remarkable cluster."

13.1" (9/29/84): fairly bright, very small, high surface brightness, definite bluish disk at 166x, excellent contrast gain with OIII filter.  Easily takes 350x due to surface brightness.


Ralph Copeland found NGC 6884 on 20 Sep 1884 at Dun Echt, Aberdeen, using an objective-prism sweep with a 6.1-inch refractor.  He remarked "planetary nebula; most of the light in a single line" and measured a very accurate micrometric position (MN XLV).


Edward Pickering discovered this planetary earlier on 8 May 1883 using a direct-vision spectroscope (same technique) at Harvard College Observatory.  Unfortunately, Pickering made a 1 hr error in RA (later corrected), so Dreyer catalogued it as NGC 6766 at the wrong position and this number is usually considered nonexistent.  By historical precedence, this planetary should be called NGC 6766, but it is now known as NGC 6884.


Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) noted "no central star can be distinguished. A minute, bright, round disk, of nearly equal brightness throughout, with a suggestion of an elongated brighter central portion in p.a. 135°; 7.5" in diameter in a 5 min exposure."

Weak in the center of the triangle except for about 10 other stars.  A wide bright pair is at the east vertex and a wide unequal double star is at the SW side.  Most stars are located along the west side particularly at the NW corner (this subgroup is catalogued as NGC 6882, although it may refer to the entire scattered group).

William Herschel discovered NGC 6885 = H VIII-20 = h2071 on 9 Sep 1784 (only discovery in sweep 261) and recorded "a cl of coarsely scattered stars, not very rich."  His position is 6' west of 20 Vul, within the boundaries of the cluster.  This same cluster was probably observed the next night and recorded as H VIII-22 = NGC 6882, but with a 15' error in declination.  So, NGC 6882 = NGC  6885, though NGC 6882 is often taken as a richer subgroup on the northwest side of the cluster.  JH made the single observation "Splendid cluster.  More than fills the field; loose and straggling; poor in stars, one = 6.7m, whose place is given; the rest 9, 10, 11."  Karl Harding found the cluster again in 1823 (probably with a 8.5-inch reflector built by WH, according to Wolfgang Steinicke) and included it in a list of discoveries he sent to Johann Bode.

Forms the NW vertex of a thin isosceles triangle with a mag 10.5 star 45" SSE and a mag 10 star 1.5' E.  These two brighter stars form a parallelogram with two mag 12 stars to the SE with sides of 1' and 1.5'.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 6886 on 17 Sep 1884 at Dun Echt, Scotland, using a direct vision objective-prism or Secchi prism attached to a 6.1-inch refractor.  He recorded "Nebula about 2 1.2" diam, equal to a 9.8 mag star."  His micrometric position in Monthly Notices XLV is very accurate.


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) noted, "no central star can be made out.  A round disk 6" in diameter, of nearly equal brightness throughout, forms the central part.  Two wings (of ring structure) in p.a. 135-315° bring the total length to 9"."

48" (5/3/19): at 287x and NPB filter; I was amazed by the interior filamentary structure, particularly in the southern half that was not previously observed. I was surprised the nebulous filaments that connect the central mag 7.4 Wolf-Rayet star to the western rim continues SE of the star in a well defined, distinctive filament to the dim eastern rim.


24" (9/7/18): absolutely gorgeous view of this huge cosmic bubble at 124x (21mm Ethos) and OIII filter.  The entire very irregular oval outline was easily visible and full of wispy structure and wide variation in brightness levels.  Two bright stars are involved along the rim; mag 7.2 HD 192182 (unequal double STT 401) in the center of the northern quadrant and mag 8.2 SAO 69611 on the northeast edge (7' separation).  The sharpest curve in the annulus is the section connecting these two stars.  Moving clockwise from these two stars, the highest surface brightness section of the nebula is a linear strip extending southwest of HD 192182.  Mag 7.4 WR 136 (HD 192163) is nearby in the interior, 5.4' SSW of HD 192182.  Very patchy nebulosity connects in a triangular wedge from HD 192163 to the western side of the rim, very close to the highest surface brightness section.  Continuing clockwise, the annulus brightens on the southwest edge and spreads out (thicker annulus).  This section is highly structured, though has a lower surface brightness on the inside edge.  A fairly prominent "knot", at least 30" diameter, is within this pool of nebulosity on the south side, on a line with HD 192182 and W-R 136. Continuing clockwise, the irregular annulus is weakest on the southeast facing portion of the rim.  The surrounding Milky Way field is plastered with bright and faint stars with a large number within the confines of the nebula.


17.5" (6/29/00): Stunning view at 100x (20mm Nagler) using an OIII filter.  The outline appeared as a huge, irregular cosmic egg, ~18'x11', floating in a very rich Cygnus star field.  The complete annulus as easily visible.  The brightest section is along the north side and passes through a mag 7.2 star (very unequal double) at the north edge.  This piece displays much structure with several knots and wispy tendrils. The interior has an irregular surface brightness with wispy striations that appear to radiate from the mag 7.4 Wolf-Rayet central star towards the NW rim at the end of the bright arc.  The rim is widest on the SW end with more nebulosity filling in towards the center, including an isolated bright knot that is on a line passing through the mag 7.2 star on the north end and the central star. The fine texture and structure of the nebulosity creates an "electric" effect with a 3-dimensional sense.


17.5" (7/5/86): the "Crescent Nebula" is one of my favorite large nebulae at 100x with a OIII filter (excellent contrast gain).  Appears as a bright, 16'x11' oval or egg-shaped annulus elongated SW-NE.  The rim is virtually complete except for a small piece of the east side and exhibits a great deal of turbulent, wispy structure.  The rim os brightest just SW of mag 7.2 HD 192182 (unequal pair O∑ 401 = 7.2/10.5 at 14"), which is embedded in the rim at the north end.  The nebula also passes through mag 8.2 SAO 69611 on the NE side.  Just north of center in the interior is the mag 7.4 Wolf-Rayet star HD 192163 = W-R 136, whose strong stellar wind created this shocked ring-type nebula.  This is beautiful nebulosity set in a very rich Milky Way field.


13.1" (9/6/81): bright, large, oval shell, nearly complete loop visible with UHC, striking unusual appearance!


8" (9/7/18): used an 8" off-axis mask on my 24-inch, along with a 31 Nagler (84x) and an OIII filter.  I was surprised how much of the ellipse could be easily traced -- perhaps 240°, extending clockwise from mag 8.2 SAO 69611.  The most prominent section is the piece SW of mag 7.3 HD 192182, but the thick section at the SW end with a somewhat lower surface brightness was easily seen.


8" (8/9/80): faint, elongated arc of nebulosity connecting two mag 7.5/8.5 stars and extending SW of the brighter star.  Set in a very rich star field.  Only the brightest portion at the north end of the nebula was noticed.


6" (8/23/03): used a 6" off-axis mask on my 18", along with a 31 Nagler (73x) and an OIII filter.  A faint curving arc was visible which begins SW of the mag 7.2 star on the north edge and curves around to the mag 8.2 star on the NE side, extending nearly 90° of arc along the annulus of the Crescent Nebula.  No other nebulosity was visible.


80mm finder (6/7/08): using 25x and an OIII filter, the brighter northern side of the shell was clearly visible and appeared locally brightest in an elongated arc on the north side passing through mag 7.2 HD 192182.  A very faint hazy glow with no structure completed most of a large oval.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6888 = H IV-72 on 15 Sep 1792 (sweep 1027) and recorded "8m.  Double.  A faint milky ray south preceding joins to the double star; it is about 8' long, and is 1 1/2' broad."  His position is within the interior of this Wolf-Rayet shell, but Bigourdan's corrected RA from 18 Oct 1895 (copied to the IC 2 notes) matches the brightest arc.  Dreyer made three detailed observations and a sketch using the 72", which was published in plate V of the 1880 publication "Observations of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars".


NGC 6888 is illuminated by the Wolf-Rayet star
 HD 192163 = SAO 69592 at 20 12.1 +38 21.  This emission star was "discovered" spectroscopically by Copeland while sweeping with a Secchi prism at Dun Echt, Aberdeen and listed in MN 45, p91.  Copeland noted "this is the 7.1 mag star DM +37°3821.  It has a spectrum of several bright lines near D, and a very bright band in wavelength 464 mmm."


As far as the nickname "Crescent Nebula", in the 1920 Mt Wilson observations (based on 60" plates), Francis Pease description reads: "It is roughly elliptical, 18'x9', p.a. 42°.  The N, Np and Sp edges include the bulk of the nebulosity, which gives it a crescent form, the bowl of which is filled with faint and scattered nebulosity."

ESO 186-036, located 25' NE, was noted as fairly bright, fairly large, edge-on 4:1 SSW-NNE, 1.5'x0.4', sharply concentrated with an elongated bright nucleus.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6889 = h3823 on 9 Jun 1836 and recorded "vF; L; lE; 2' l, 90" br."  His position is accurate.

24" (7/1/16): at 375x; very bright bluish disc slightly elongated NNW-SSE, perhaps 10"x8".  A fainter outer halo increases the diameter to roughly 18".  The mag 12.5-13 central star was steadily visible.  A mag 14.5 star is close off the NE edge [17" from center].  At 750x the brighter inner disc seemed more elongated with tapered ends like a lens.


18" (9/10/07): Using 225x; the bright, blue disc of high surface brightness surrounds the central star.  At 300x the very bright oval disc of 8"x6" diameter is surrounded by a fainter, round outer envelope that increases the diameter to ~15".  With direct vision the central star is visible embedded in the center of the high surface brightness disc.  A mag 12.5 star lies 1' WNW and a mag 13 star is a similar distance ESE with NGC 6891 nearly at the midpoint.


18" (7/15/07): at 174x this small blue disc has a high surface brightness and is very prominent in the field.  With direct vision the mag 12.5-13 central star is easily visible.  At 280x appears as a very bright, small disc with an unusually high surface brightness and the central star shines steadily.  At 700x, the extremely bright inner region is slightly elongated or lens-shaped N-S and is surrounded by a fainter outer halo or envelope that is still quite evident.


17.5" (8/27/87): very bright at 140x and OIII filter.  Appears as a small high surface brightness bluish oval of 10"-15" diameter.  At 410x, a brighter center or mag 13 central star is visible.  At this magnification, the planetary appears as a bright oval with a fainter outer halo.


8" (6/29/84): fairly high surface brightness, small blue disk.


80mm (9/10/07): visible as a faint "star" at 12.5x in the 80mm finder and easy to verify as a planetary by blinking with an OIII filter.


Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 6891 on 22 Sep 1884 at Dun Echt, Scotland, using a direct vision objective-prism (Secchi prism) sweep with a 6.1-inch refractor.  He remarked "this seems to be identical with the 9.5 mag star DM +12°4266.  It is in reality a planetary nebula about 4" in diameter with a nearly monochromatic spectrum."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) noted, "mag 11.8 central star (Burnham).  A round disk 15" in diameter, of which the central 7" is considerably the brighter.  From this brighter center extend indistinct traces of wings in p.a. about 135-315°."

The rim appears unevenly lit and possibly brighter along the north side although there are a couple of extremely faint stars involved on the north or NW portion of the rim that may have affected this impression.  At 700x the rim is clumpy and a bit weaker on the west side.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6894 = H IV-13 = h2072 on 17 Jul 1784 (sweep 239) and recorded "pF, exactly R, of equal light throughout.  I believe it is resolvable, but am not certain, about 1' in diameter."  He published a sketch in his 1811 paper (Fig. 33) as an illlustration of "nebulae that are of an almost uniform light."


John Herschel made several observations.  On 4 Sep 1825 (sweep 7), he logged "planetary nebula; diam [by inexperienced estimation] = 1'; light equable; exactly round; vF, a mere ghost."  On 1 Aug 1829, he recorded "eF; annular; pretty sharply defined; a very little elliptic; the northern limb is the brightest; the darkness in the middle requires some attention to see; but once seen it cannot be mistaken.  A most curious object, resembling much the annular nebula in Lyra, but rounder, small (not above half the diameter) and far fainter."


LdR (or assistants) also described NGC 6894 as "annular" on 23 Aug 1851 (first observed on Aug 1 1848): "fine annular nebula like that in Lyra, R, the dark space is E pf, star easily seen in np edge and others suspected."


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick Observatory (earliest in 1899), Heber Curtis called NGC 6894 "The Annular Nebula in Cygnus".  He reported "the central star is about mag 16.  A very vague and indistinct ring, 44" in diameter along a major axis in p.a. 50°.  Quite faint; the brightest patch is at the north, near the 14th mag star involved in the ring."

Albert Marth discovered NGC 6901 = m 409 on 15 Aug 1863 and simply noted "eF".  There is nothing at his position, although his observation was noted as verified.  But one minute of time further east is UGC 11542 = PGC 64552.  According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan was misled by Marth's poor position and rediscovered this galaxy on 29 Sep 1891 and it was listed as Big. 335 (later IC 5000) at the correct position.  Nearby IC 1316, also logged by Bigourdan on the same evening, is nonexistent according to Corwin.


RNGC identifies UGC 11542 as NGC 6901, though their New Description reads "not found".  Assuming Marth made a 1.0 minute clerical error in RA, this identification is reasonable.  The CGCG mislabels UGC 11542 as IC 1316 and the UGC wrongly states IC 1316 = IC 5000.  RC2 and RNGC equate all three numbers.  I included this number in my RNGC Corrections #5.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6902 = h3827 on 2 Sep 1836 and recorded "F; R; psbM; 25"."  His position is accurate.  Harold Corwin suggests that Lewis Swift made an 18 minute error in time in recording the RA of Sw. XII-15 = IC 4946 as well as Sw. XII-16 = IC 4948, as his descriptions and relative positions are a reasonable match for these two galaxies, particularly IC 4946.  Making this correction, NGC 6902 = IC 4948.  But Swift lists the discovery date for IC 4948 as 17 Sep 1897, 6 nights later than IC 4946.  So, some uncertainly on this equivalence still remains.


Glen Cozens has suggested James Dunlop's D 451 may be NGC 6902.  Dunlop found "an extremely small faint elliptical nebula, about 12" long and 8" broad, with a small bright point in the following extremity, which may be a star."  He made a single observation but his position is 1.2° due south of NGC 6902 and furthermore  there is no bright star near the eastern end of NGC 6902, so I'm skeptical of this identiication.

24" (8/14/15): the "Blue Flash" planetary was observed at 500x and 750x in excellent seeing.  The main body is oval 5:4 NNW-SSE, ~48"x40" and annular.  The rim appeared brightest along a thin strip on the east side and enhanced in a slightly brighter triangular wedge (roughly 60°-80°) extending east from the mag 15.7 central star.  The opposite western rim was also brighter, but the north and south ends as not enhanced.  The interior was mottled with a slightly darker, irregular central "hole", particularly on the south and west side of the central star, but not to the east.  Mag 10.4 HD 352100 lies 48" N of center and a mag 12 star is 38" SSE of center, in the direction of the major axis.


An extremely faint outer halo or wing was occasionally glimpsed off the north-northwest end, tapering in the direction of the major axis and extending 10"-12" in length.  The corresponding extension off the south-southeast side and ending at the mag 12 star (completing a lens-shaped outline out of a truncated ellipse on deep images) was not seen, although Jimi Lowrey felt it was equally visible.


48" (5/16/12): beautiful blue oval planetary with a fairly bright central star.  Very nice annular appearance with an irregular darker interior.  A bright arc is along the east or northeast rim and a slightly weaker counterpart was on the west or southwest edge.  The ends are somewhat chopped off, creating a rectangular appearance.


18" (7/2/08): at 565x, this interesting planetary had a very irregular surface brightness and appeared weaker on the north and south sides and slightly brighter in a triangular wedge that fanned out to the east from the central star.  The edge of the western rim was also very slightly enhanced but there wasn't a complete brighter wedge on the west side of the central star, which would have created a subtle bipolar dumbbell shape. The faint central star was visible continuously at this magnification.


18" (8/23/03): beautiful planetary at 320x and 538x.  The mag 15.7 central star is easily visible continuously. The interior seems unevenly lit and there appears to be a very slightly darker "hole" to the north of the central star.  Bracketed by a mag 11 star off north edge and a mag 12 star just off the south edge and the planetary is slightly elongated N-S in the direction of these stars.


17.5" (8/31/86): very pretty planetary at 280x.  Fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated.  A very faint central star (V = 15.7) is visible.  Takes 440x well.  Just off the north edge is a mag 11 star 1.4' from center and a mag 12 star is just off the south edge 39" from center.


8" (6/29/84): moderately bright, uniform, slightly elongated N-S, two stars at the northeast and south edge.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6905 = H IV-16 = h2075 on 16 Sep 1784 (sweep 275) and recorded "pB, perfectly R, pretty well defined, about 3' in diameter." The next night he noted "I do not doubt but it consists of very much compressed stars."  His size estimate was much too large, but his position is just 6 seconds too far west.  JH made 3 observations and logged on sweep 364, "Fine planetary nebula; B; exactly R; rather hazy at the edges, but not materially brighter in the middle, but no hollow.  It has four small stars near it like satellites."  The nearby stars were micrometrically measured as the possibility of physical satellites of planetaries intrigued JH and he mentioned it regarding NGC 6818 and 7662.


On 10 Aug 1850 Lord Rosse's assistant reported, "* or B nucl nf the middle.  A dark curved line p[receding] this plainly seen, which at moments I fancied went round the sf part". Two years later, George Johnstone Stoney stated "this planetary nebela is a beautiful little spiral".  This is a case of imagined spiral structure as it was a primary focus at Birr Castle.  R.J. Mitchell's sketch from 12 Aug 1855 with a spiral appearance was included in the 1861 publication (Plate XXVIII, figure 34).  Father Secchi noted a bi-polar brightening or mottling, particularly on the east side (1856, 9.5" refractor).  Vogel made an excellent sketch of the planetary in Sep 1883 with the 27" Vienna refractor with a dark lane oriented ~N-S, tapering towards the central star and two brighter triangular "wings" on the east and west side, with the eastern wing more prominent.


Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported "the main portion is a very patchy truncated ellipse 44"x37" in p.a. 163°.  Very faint cone-shaped ansae extend from each end.  A star of mag 12 lies nearly at the end of the southern ansa."


John Mallas coined the nickname "Blue Flash" in his Aug/Sep 1963 article "Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebulae-VI", published in the "Review of Popular Astronomy".  He described NGC 6905 as "The Blue Flash. After turning a telescope on this object one will notice the small triangle of stars superimposed upon it.  Glimmering and flashing between the triangle is the little planetary.  Using about 120x on a 4-inch reveals all that can be seen in small apertures."

48" (10/25/14): the central 1.2' bar of NGC 6907 runs E-W and contained a bright core and very bright nucleus that increased to the center.  The more prominent spiral arm is attached on the east end of the bar and the section that hooks north contains NGC 6908, a superimposed galaxy.  It appeared fairly bright, elongated 3:1 N-S, ~21"x7", very small bright core -- and appeared distinctly as a separate galaxy.  A mag 16 star is just off the northeast end of NGC 6908.   The arm bends clockwise west and dims as it extends to nearly the west end of the central bar (much further than seen with my 24").  The southern arm was fainter, more diffuse and broader, but swept around to the east on the south side of the halo, reaching nearly to the east end of the central bar.  Two non-stellar HII knots (~10" diameter) were seen along this arm and they made an equilateral triangle with the nucleus; the brighter knot is at the west end of this arm, 0.8' SE of center, and a second knot lies 0.8' SSW of center.


24" (8/14/15): the companion galaxy superimposed on the eastern arm was clearly visible and fairly well defined, elongated 5:2 N-S, ~20"x8".


24" (7/25/14): striking example of a barred spiral with a prominent 1.5'x0.5' central bar oriented directly east-west.  The bar contains a bright 30" core, which increases to a quasi-stellar nucleus.  A bright arm is attached at the east end of the bar and extends due north for 0.7', at a right angle to the bar.  A bright, elongated N-S "knot" is embedded in the middle (superimposed companion NGC 6908).  At the north end, the arm  curls west a short distance while dimming out.  A difficult, ill-defined arm is attached at the west end of the bar.  It vaguely curves south and west, but quickly disappears into very low surface brightness haze.


24" (9/15/12): excellent barred spiral with the 1.5' central bar oriented E-W.  The bar has a small, brighter core that increases to a faint stellar nucleus.  On the east side of the bar a prominent spiral arm is attached that hooks at a 90° angle to the north for ~45".  The arm dims and curves clockwise to the west a short distance, creating a "comma" appearance in the eyepiece with north down and west left.  There is a noticeable elongated brightening or N-S streak in the arm at the northern end (before curving west).  This streak is NGC 6908, a superimposed companion.  On the west side of the bar, the beginning of a low surface brightness arm (hazy extension) bends southwest a very short distance and dims out.


18" (9/3/08): beautiful view at 280x using an 8mm Ethos.  A large 2' "bar" is oriented E-W with a broad, weak concentration but suddenly rises to a very small, bright core and faint stellar nucleus.  On the east side of the bar, a spiral arm is attached that hooks directly to the north and just begins to sweep clockwise around on the north side of the galaxy towards the west.  There appears to a brightening (faint knot) near where the arm is attached to the bar.  Off the west side is faint haze on the south side, but the arm structure is very weak.  A mag 11.5 star lies 2.8' due east of center on line with the central bar.  An elongated galaxy (NGC 6908) oriented N-S is superimposed on the eastern arm as it hooks north though visually the galaxy and the arm appear indistinguishable.


17.5" (8/8/02): beautiful view at 220x.  This barred spiral appeared moderately bright and large with a fairly bright bar elongated "bar" oriented ~E-W with a small bright core.  At the following end of the bar an obvious arm is attached is attached sweeping north of the galaxy in a comma-like appendage.  On the preceding end there seems to be a faint knot and there is a very short extension bending south that quickly fades out.


17.5" (9/14/85): at 192x appears moderately bright, bright core, elongated E-W.  Barred spiral structure is evident; fainter extensions form the bar and an arm at the eastern end of the bar curves north and then hooks slightly back to the west.  This spiral arm appears to end at a faint knot.  Two mag 11.5 stars lie 3' E and a similar distance south.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6907 = H III-141 = h2076 on 12 Jul 1784 (sweep 236) and recorded "a pretty considerable vF nebula, lE, vlbM than at the extremes.  240 showed the same appearance; it makes a trapezium with 3 stars and is at the northern and following corner of it."  JH made the single observation (from Slough), "vF; L; R; vglbM; 3' diam; r; the sky hazy."  His position is accurate.   In a 5-inch refractor at Vanderbilt, Barnard called it  "faint and somewhat faint; it is close preceding a 9-magnitude star, and is gradually pretty much brighter in the middle."

48" (10/25/14): at 610x; the elongated brightening in the northeast spiral arm appeared fairly bright, elongated 3:1 N-S, ~21"x7", very small bright core. This was the first time this object appeared as a superimposed galaxy and not just as a weak brightening in the arm itself.


24" (8/14/15): the companion galaxy superimposed on the eastern arm was clearly visible and fairly well defined, elongated 5:2 N-S, ~20"x8".


24" (7/25/14): A bright arm is attached at the east end of NGC 6907's bar and extends due north for 0.7', at a right angle to the bar.  A bright, elongated N-S "knot" is embedded in the middle (superimposed companion NGC 6908).  At the north end, the arm  curls west a short distance while dimming out.


24" (9/15/12): the spiral arm that extends north on the eastern end of the bar of NGC 6907 contains a noticeable brightening on the north end that is actually a superimposed galaxy.  The companion is elongated 3:1 N-S, 0.3'x0.1' and appears as a short streak within the arm.  NGC 6908 may apply to the entire spiral arm or this elongated brightening (galaxy).


18" (9/3/08): this number refers to the prominent spiral arm on the NE side where an anonymous galaxy (elongated N-S) is superimposed on the arm in roughly the same orientation!  Visually the spiral arm hooks directly to the north from the east end of the central bar, just where the galaxy is located, though the galaxy was not distinguishable.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 6908 = m 411 on 24 Sep 1864 and noted "eF, vS, lE, (close to h2076 [= NGC 6907]."  His position corresponds with the brighter trailing spiral arm, or more specifically the elongated companion that is superimposed on the northeastern arm.  The companion is clearly visible on a deep image.

A mag 7.4 star (SAO 49556) with two faint companions is at the NW end and a mag 7 star (SAO 49563) is at the SE end surrounded by a rich group of 10 mag 12-13 stars.  Most of the cluster's brighter mag 10-11 stars are arranged in a NW-SE string just west of the line connecting the two bright stars.  A second curving offshoot to the west consisting of three mag 10 stars gives a "Y" shape to the cluster.  Located 40' NNE of Gamma Cygni (V = 2.2) within a section of the IC 1318 complex.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6910 = H VIII-56 = h2077 on 17 Oct 1786 (sweep 612) and recorded "a small cluster of coarsely scattered stars, of various sizes; of an extended form; like a forming one [cluster]."

Charles Messier discovered M29 = NGC 6913 = h2078 on 29 July 1764.  Caroline Herschel observed this group on 6 Apr 1783 and logged "About 1 deg under Gamma Cygni; in my telescope 5 small stars thus [diagram]. My Brother looked at them with the 7 ft and counted 12. It is not in Mess. catalogue."  According to Michael Hoskins, the position and diagram applies to M29, despite her comment that it wasn't a Messier.  On 15 Sep 1792 (sweep 1027), William Herschel recorded "a cluster of very coarsely sc. vL stars; not rich."

Size 13'x12'


18" (8/12/07): at 73x, this rich Milky Way region contains three sections of reflection nebulosity.  The brightest piece (GN 20.22.9) was discovered by Stephan and is located 11' SW of mag 6.9 HD 194708.  It involves two mag 11 stars and a mag 12.5 star on the west side.  About 6' S is another hazy patch (vdB 132 = GN 20.23.0) surrounding a wide mag 9/11 pair at 43".  Faint haze connects these two pieces and together they extend ~10'x3' in a N-S orientation.  This reflection nebula appears to be bounded on the west side by a non-illuminated dust cloud.


A third weak reflection nebula (vdB 131) is located 12' SSW of the brighter (northern) section of NGC 6914.  It involves a group of 10-15 stars (Dolidze 8) including two mag 9.5 stars and a nice curving arc of stars is just off the southeast side.  Overall, the Milky Way is very patchy or dusty in this region so these reflection nebulae do not stand out prominently, though the contrast was improved using a Deep Sky filter.


To the SE of the NGC 6914 complex is a very faint, hazy HII region (LBN 279), situated just east of mag 7.5 HD 194669.  It appears roughly 10'x6' in size and includes a number of mag 10-11 stars.  There was only a weak response to a UHC filter, though there was no response to a Deep Sky filter and this is not part of the reflection complex.


17.5" (8/7/91): at 100x appears as a fairly bright field of reflection nebulosity locally brightest surrounding two pairs of fairly bright stars.  Two mag 11 stars are at the north end with a separation of 51" and a mag 9 (SAO 49589)/mag 11 pair with a separation of 42" is at the south end.  These two sections are separated by ~6' and are connected by a fainter elongated piece of nebulosity.  Very faint nebulosity also extends NE towards a mag 7 star (SAO 49603) located 11' NE.  Stephan's position is centered on the northern pair of stars.  A third piece surrounding a mag 9 further SW was not noted.


8" (7/24/82): fairly large nebulous field locally brighter surrounding a wide faint double star and to the south surrounding a double star mag 9.  The brightest section is elongated N-S.


Édouard Stephan discovered NGC 6914 = St XII-93 on 29 Aug 1881 and recorded "vF, vL, iR, dif, 2 st att p[receding]." [NGC description].  His position is accurate.  The patch ~6' south is sometimes called NGC 6914B and is part of the same reflection nebula complex.  It's not clear from Stephan's description how large an area of nebulosity he noticed.

Harold Corwin suggests that Lewis Swift's XII-20 (later IC 5015), found on 18 Aug 1897, may be a duplicate observation.  He feels Swift's description "pB, pS, R, nearly bet 2 st with dist. companion" is a reasonable fit, though the position is poor (typical for those made in 1897).  But I would be surprised if Swift called this galaxy "pretty small" as well as "round", and his position is well off in both RA (6 minutes of time) and Dec (17'), so I've listed it as not found.

William Herschel discovered NGC 6926 = H III-142 = h2079 on 21 Jul 1784 (sweep 242) and recorded "vF, E, nearly of equal light throughout and about 2' long.  A patch of not very close small stars north following."  His RA was poor (too large), but clearly applies to UGC 11588.  On 12 Sep 1830, John Herschel logged "vF; pL; pmE; or two joined; nearly in the meridian [N-S]."  On JH's first observation three years earlier, he discovered nearby NGC 6929.

18" (6/25/04): at 300x, partially resolved into a couple of dozen stars, particularly on the south side of the very ragged 3' halo which surrounds the bright 50" core.  At 538x, perhaps 3 dozen stars are resolved mostly in the halo, but also several are superimposed on the very mottled core including one very close to the geometric center.  The halo is irregular, but clearly elongated N-S with more extension resolution on the south side.  A number of extremely faint stars pop in and out of view with the seeing and the cluster seems of the verge of more extensive resolution.


17.5" (8/5/94): bright, 3.0' diameter, round.  Fairly sharp concentration with a 1.5' diameter very bright core.  The halo has about two dozen stars peppered in the outer regions; the brightest star is on the NE side of the core.  The core is very lively and just starts to break up in to several very faint stars and a single obvious star.  A mag 9.5 star is just 2' W of center.


17.5" (7/9/94): bright, fairly small, 3.5' diameter, very bright core.  At 225x, 20-25 stars are resolved in the halo mostly in the southern portion.  Contains an intense 1.5' core with a much fainter halo to 3.5' which extends almost to a mag 9.5 star 2' W of center.  The bright core itself is very lively and mottled with a few faint stars resolved and a single brighter star just east of the geometric center.

A number of the stars are in chains, including a string of equally spaced 12-13th magnitude stars along the south side that is oriented NW-SE.  NGC 6946 (which was sporting a supernova) lies 40' SE and both can be placed in the same low power field.  Both objects are easily visible in 15x50 IS binoculars and of similar size, but NGC 6939 is brighter with a higher surface brightness.


18" (8/17/04): this triangular-shaped rich cluster is beautifully framed in the 160x field (24'). The cluster is enclosed within a kite asterism of four mag 10 stars with two of these stars near the east and west vertices of the triangular outline.  ~125 stars are visible in a 10' diameter, with most of the stars mag 12-14.  Just west of center is a very rich 3' group and just following this group is a small knot of 4 very faint stars.  The west side is well-defined by a string of mag 12 stars oriented NW-SE.

30" (11/5/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): bright, large, elongated ~5:2 NW-SE, 3.5'x1.5', sharply concentrated with a very small bright elongated core.  Spiral structure is evident in the halo, though I couldn't trace distinct arms.  A mag 9.5 star lies 5' NE.  Located 26' W of mag 5.4 Sigma Pavonis (2' pair with mag 7 HD 197569).

24" (7/16/15): moderately to fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, sharply concentrated with a prominent, small round core, ill-defined low surface brightness halo ~50"x30".  Located 2.6' SSE of mag 8.4 HD 196612, which forms the southwest corner of a prominent asterism including three additional mag 10-11 stars.  NGC 6944 lies 6.5' SSW.  The companion (similar redshift) appeared fairly faint, oval 4:3 SW-NE, very weak concentration to a small, slightly brighter nucleus, overall low surface brightness.


18" (9/10/07): faint, small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, 0.6'x0.45'.  Weak even concentration to the center with a faint stellar nucleus.  Located 2.5' SSE of mag 8.5 HD 196612.  This star is at the southwest vertex of a quadrilateral (roughly a parallelogram) with three other mag 10-11 stars.


17.5" (7/4/86): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, very small bright core.  Located 2.5' S of mag 9 SAO 126045.  This bright star is the southwest vertex of a 3.5'x1' parallelogram with three other mag 10 stars.  Forms a pair with NGC 6944A 6.4' SSW.  The fainter companion appeared very faint, small, round.  Located 1.6' NW of mag 8.9 SAO 126044, which detracts from viewing.  A fainter star is close northwest.

NGC 6946 = Arp 29 = UGC 11597 = MCG +10-29-006 = CGCG 304-006 = PGC 65001

V = 8.8;  Size 11.5'x9.8';  Surf Br = 13.8


24" (5/20/17, 5/22/17 and 6/23/17): Type II Supernova 2017eaw in NGC 6946 was easily identified as a 13th magnitude "star" 2.7' NNW of the nucleus using a photographic finder chart.  I was surprised the supernova was only slightly fainter in June, over a month later than first viewed.  This is the 10th known supernova in the galaxy.


48" (10/23/11): this very bright, showpiece face-on spiral stretches roughly 9'x7' E-W.  At 375x, four arms were visible, each containing one or more HII regions.  The brightest arm is attached on the west side of the central region and curves counterclockwise to the north and then heads east, passing just south of a mag 13.5 star and spreads out to the NE of the central region.  At the eastern tip (4.2' from center) is a bright HII knot of 12" diameter, catalogued as #3 under NGC 6946 in Paul Hodge and Robert Kennicutt's 1983 "Atlas of HII Regions in 125 Galaxies" (HK83-3) and #1 in Hodge's 1969 paper "HII regions in twenty nearby galaxies" (H69-1).  A second shorter arm vaguely emerges from the core on the north side, and rotates more sharply around the galaxy on the north side, passing south of the brighter arm, and curving around to the east side.  It contains HK83-63/76 = H69-6, an elongated knotty HII complex at its tip, 2.5' due east of center.


On the west side are two additional arms, though the brighter inner arm is better defined.  It begins on the south side of the central region and curls sharply to the north on the west side.  It passes through a few mag 14 foreground stars and nearly fades out 3.2' NW of center.  A dim extension finally ends 3.5' N of center at HK83-285 = H69-20, a very faint, very small knot inside a triangle of stars.  An outer arm on the south side rotates towards the west and intersects HK83-503/507 = H69-33, a very bright, round knot of 20" diameter, that rivals the inner core in size.  Using a DGM Optics "Galaxy Contrast" filter, the core was dimmed more and the knot appeared nearly as bright.  Studies reveal this feature is a circular bubble containing numerous, tightly packed small clusters and a bright supermassive star cluster that resembles a young globular. After this point, the arm becomes more patchy as it spreads to the northwest, but near the end is HK83-527/528, an extremely faint knot just west of a mag 14 star 3.5' NW of center.


24" (9/13/12): the bright, long, outer spiral arm on the north side passes very close south of a mag 13.5 star before terminating near the small knot HK83-3 = H69-1.  Besides the knot at the end, this arm is a bit clumpy with two slightly brighter regions roughly 1.7' N of center, HK83-213 = H69-11, and 2.4' NE of center, HK83-123/124 = H69-10.  The spiral arm extending north on the west side has several mag 14 stars superimposed. A very small brighter nucleus is embedded the very broadly brighter central region.


18" (8/1/08): I took another look at the bright, circular knot that contains a young massive globular.  This knot is located 2.8' WSW of the core of NGC 6946.  It was fairly easy to identify using a pair of mag 13/13.5 stars [18" separation] with the cluster situated 1.5' NW of this fairly wide double.  At 280x it appeared as a very faint, hazy glow, ~15" diameter (nearly the separation of an unequal double star to the southeast).


18" (7/31/05): using the photographic finder chart in the 2000 Astrophysical Journal (535,748) paper titled "A Young Globular Cluster in the Galaxy NGC 6946", I tracked down this "knot" which contains numerous star clusters as well as a 15 million year old supermassive star cluster or young globular.  This object is located 2.8' W of the core and 1.5' NW of a wide, unequal pair of stars.  On the DSS, it appears to be located near the end of a faint arm (not seen) that attaches to the core on the south side and extends to the west.  Using the image, I quickly pinpointed the location and at 323x a very faint, small, roundish glow of ~15" diameter was visible.  This very low surface brightness spot was visible 80-90% of the time with averted vision once identified and appeared similar to a faint Abell planetary.  Without the finder chart, I would probably have passed over this object without noticing it, and in fact missed it in my observation from the White Mountains in 8/29/02.  Using ALADIN, the position of the young globular is 20 34 31.7 +60 08 17.


18" (10/9/04): viewed type II supernova 2004e, discovered 9/27/04 (13 days ago) and appearing at approximately mag 12.8.  It was easily identified using a photographic finder chart.  The supernova is located 4.1' E and 1.9' S of the nucleus, just west of a pair of mag 13/13.5 stars at 12" separation and was comparable to the brighter star of this pair.  A fainter mag 14.4 star is close WSW and the three stars plus supernova form a small wedge or Sagitta shaped group.  This is the 8th supernova discovered in NGC 6946 since 1917.  NGC 6939 and 6946 were both easily visible in 15x50 IS binoculars and of similar size, but NGC 6939 is brighter with a higher surface brightness.


17.5" (8/29/92, White Mountains at 12,000 ft): bright, very large, 6' diameter to main body, elongated 3:2 ~E-W.  Three arms are visible.  A long bright arm is attached at the north side of the core and trails to the east (Arp's "One Heavy Arm").  This eastern arm splits; a short fainter branch bends south following the core and a long curving bright arm terminates with a very faint, very small HII knot (HK83 #3).  On the west side a fainter arm shoots sharply to the north from the core.  These outer arms significantly increase the diameter of the main body.  The galaxy has a very large brighter middle but the core is just a very small brighter region close SW of the geometric center.  A very faint stellar nucleus was seen with direct vision.


17.5" (8/13/88): main spiral arm very prominent and easily seen to split.


17.5" (9/14/85): bright, large, brighter central core.  A prominent arm is attached on the NE side of the core and trails to the east.  This arm splits - the shorter arm is close to the core and a brighter region or arm to the west.


13.1" (7/27/84): bright arm on the east side highly suspected to branch or split into two arms.  Also an arm or brighter region seen on the opposite side of the galaxy pointing west a short way.


13.1" (7/16/82): the central region is elongated and fairly low surface brightness though a spiral arm clearly trails off to the east from the main body creating a non-symmetrical appearance.


8" (6/22/81): faint, large, diffuse, brighter core.  Situated in a rich star field.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6946 = H IV-76 = h2084 on 9 Sep 1798 (sweep 1077) and recorded "cF, vL, iF, a sort of BNM.  The nebulosity extends 6 or 7'.  The N seems to consist of some vS stars; the nebulosity is of the milky kind.  It is a pretty object." John Herschel made 3 observations and on 11 Aug 1831 logged "vF; eL; vglbM; r; 5' or 6' dia; irreg fig.  A curious object; no doubt a great cluster of eF stars.  Requires the eye to be well prepared for seeing it."


Bindon Stoney, LdR's assistant on 6 Sep 1850, described a "New spiral, very fine but faint; 3 branches, of which two terminate in knots, a fourth branch north preceding very doubtful."  Two nights later he made an excellent sketch (Plate XXX, fig. 36) that was included in the 1861 publication.  On 6 Sep 1855, R.J. Mitchell recorded, "The two following branches unite in one before meeting the nucleus; I certainly see a fourth branch preceding which seems to join the other preceding branch in the same way before reaching the nucleus. Of the four, those which terminate in knots are the brightest."


E.E. Barnard reported (Sidereal Messenger, vol. 5, p286) he first viewed NGC 6946 around 1881 with the 5-inch refractor and marked it as "vvF".  But on 28 May 1885 he found it "almost bright, certainly not faint.  It is moderate in size, round, vgbM with some small stars grouped around it.  Its brightness is a little less than cluster GC 4590 [NGC 6939]."


Ten supernovae (most of any galaxy) have been detected in NGC 6946 as of 2017.  The first, SN 1917A, occurred on 19 Jul 1917 when it was discovered by Ritchey and was considered a nova. This supernova, situated 37" W and 105" S of the galaxy's nucleus, peaked at 14.6 mag.

17.5" (9/23/95): very scattered group of mag 9.5-13 stars in roughly a 10'-15' region.  Barely stands out in the 20mm Nagler field and not worth noting as a cluster.  There are no specific borders but the stars have the appearance of being aligned in strings or groups.  Most prominent is an elongated group oriented WNW-ESE through the two brightest mag 9-10 stars (brightest star at 20 41 10.5 +16 38.9). A small line of three mag 13 stars is near the western end of the string.  Appears to be a random grouping and listed as nonexistent in RNGC.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6950 = H VIII-23 = h2085 on 15 Oct 1784 (sweep 290) and recorded "A Cl of coarsely sc. stars."  JH described this group of stars as a "Poor, large, scattered cl, the brightest * 10m."  His position is very close to a mag 9.5 star at 20 41 10.5 +16 38 55.  Karl Reinmuth reported "a very loose clustering of st 10...15 in a dense region.", based on a Heidelberg plate.  This may not be a true cluster, but RNGC misclassifies the number as nonexistent.

48" (10/23/14): NGC 6951 is a large spiral with a brighter central region extending ~1.8'x1.2' ~E-W and outer spiral arms (reaching north and south) that increase the dimensions to 2.8'x2.0'.  Well concentrated with an intensely bright, circular core that is embedded with a bright, elongated oval "bar" extending E-W.  A fairly narrow spiral arm is attached at the west end of the central region and curves strongly counterclockwise to the north, passing between two mag 15.8 stars [1.3' WNW and 0.8' NW of center].  This fairly low surface brightness arm is widely detached from the glow of the central region as it curls to the east, ending about 1.5' NNE of center.  On the east side of the elongated core region a faint, shorter spiral arm curves south, passing near 3 or 4 faint stars oriented N-S and fades out ~1' SSW of center.


24" (7/23/14): fairly bright, fairly large, slightly elongated, ~2' diameter.  Sharply concentrated with a small, very bright core.  A fairly broad "bar" extends east-west through the central region.  Weak spiral structure is definite with careful viewing.  An eastern arm appears as a subtle arc curving counterclockwise and passing west and then south of a mag 12.7 star 1.4' east of center.  I expected the western arm to be more obvious, but it was only visible as a slightly brighter curving "edge" of the outer halo from west to north.


18" (8/17/04): at 225x appears moderately bright and large, oval 3:2 WNW-ESE, ~1.8'x1.1'.  On the east end is a mag 12.5 star.  The galaxy suddenly brightens to a very small, brighter core.  The edge of the halo fades and increases in size with averted vision.  Appears slightly brighter along the major axis with a hint of structure.


17.5" (10/30/99): observed SN 1999el, which was discovered 11 days ago (Oct 20).  It appeared as a mag 14.5-15 star just following the core (22" E and 8" S) and easily visible at 280x.  The galaxy is fairly faint and moderately large.  Sharply concentrated with a small bright core surrounded by a diffuse halo elongated 3:2 E-W.  A mag 12 star is 1.5' following the center and a mag 15 star is just visible a similar distance WNW.


17.5" (8/13/88): bright with a very bright core surrounded by a fainter large oval halo 3:2 E-W.  A mag 13 star is just off the east edge 1.4' from center and a mag 15 star is off the NW end.


8" (6/22/81): faint, small, bright core.  A mag 13 star is at the east edge.


Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6951 = Sw. II-85 with his 4.5" comet sweeper (date unknown), though didn't announce the discovery.  He recorded it on 14 Sep 1885 with his 16-inch Clark refractor and noted "pB; pL; lE.  Discovered many years ago with 4 1/2 inch”.

His RA was 13 seconds too small.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position in 1899-00 with the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver as well as Hermann Kobold at Strasbourg in June 1899.


Jérôme Coggia made the original discovery of this galaxy sometime before 1878 at the Marseilles Observatory and it was catalogued as NGC 6952.  Coggia's position was 20' too far north, so Dreyer assumed these were two different objects.  In 1892, William Denning proposed the equivalence NGC 6951 = NGC 6952 (The Observatory, 15, 106) and Dreyer reported the identity in the IC 1 appendix, though suggested it was 6951's position that was in error.  This confusion was corrected in the IC 2 appendix.


Based on a Crossley reflector photo, Heber Curtis (1918) described NGC 6951 as "Rather faint, symmetrical spiral 3.5' in diameter. Very bright, slightly oval nucleus 0.2' long. {Phi}-type.

Jerome Coggia discovered NGC 6952 around 1877 at the Marseilles Observatory, probably using a 7.2-inch refractor. The discovery was apparently communicated directly to Dreyer and first appeared in the GC Supplement. There is nothing at his position, but 20' south is UGC 11604 = PGC 65086 and Coggia's description of a 15th mag star close following matches this galaxy.  According to Steinicke, this was Coggia's only NGC discovery.  Lewis Swift independently rediscovered this galaxy on 14 Sep 1885 and placed it accurately in list II-85 (later catalogued as NGC 6951). William Denning noted the equivalence NGC 6951 = NGC 6952 (The Observatory, 15, 106, 1892) and Dreyer repeated the identity in the IC 1 Notes section.

Lewis Swift discovered NGC 6953 = Sw. II-86 on 14 Sep 1885 with his 16" refractor and noted "eeeF, pL, R, ee difficult."  There is nothing near his position other than a mixed variety of stars.


Herbert Howe examined the field in 1899-00 with the 20-inch refractor at the University of Denver and reported "I could not find this, which is called by Swift 'eeF, pL, vdiffic.'  17 seconds preceding and 0.2' south of the place given by Swift is a small group of at least four stars of mag 14, which was scruntinised for nebulosity, but in vain."  Bigourdan also identified the same stars, at 20 37 45 +65 46 00 (2000), as NGC 6953. This identification is very uncertain and perhaps Swift made a large error in his position.  See Harold Corwin's comments for more on this number.

24" (8/5/13): moderately bright to fairly bright, moderately large, elongated ~3:2 NW-SE, 60"x40".  The view is somewhat hampered by a mag 11 star that is superimposed on the east edge and a mag 14.5 star is ~20" E of the bright star.  This galaxy appears to be a barred spiral with a brighter bar oriented ~N-S extending down the middle of the glow.  The brighter nucleus is quasi-stellar (~5") and similar to the mag 14.5 star in brightness.  A faint extension (spiral arm) curves east from the south end of the bar, extending south of the mag 11 star.  Brightest in a trio (KTG 71) with UGC 11620 6.9' SE and UGC 11623 8.1' E.  Located in a rich Milky Way star field 3.7' SSW of a mag 9.6 star.


UGC 11620 appeared faint/fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, 21"x14".  Two mag 13/14 stars are off the SE end and a mag 15.5 star is near the NNE end [22" from center].  UGC 11623 is fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 36"x20", a small brighter core is embedded in a fairly smooth halo.  A small trio of mag 13/14.5.15 stars is close preceding.


18" (9/10/07): fairly faint, moderately large, round, weak concentration except for a quasi-stellar nucleus. A mag 10.5 star is superimposed on the east edge of the halo and somewhat hampers the view.


17.5" (10/13/01): this moderately bright glow appears unusual as a mag 10.5 star is attached at the east side and interferes with viewing.  The surface brightness of this barred spiral is pretty uniform except for a faint stellar nucleus.  A mag 14 companion star (double) follows the brighter star.  Brightest in a trio with UGC 11620 and 11623 situated 7' SSE and 8' ESE, respectively.


13" (6/29/84): faint, diffuse, even surface brightness, possibly slightly elongated E-W.  A mag 10.5 star is attached at the east edge 26" from center and detracts from viewing.  Brightest of three with UGC 11620 6.7' SSE and UGC 11623 8.0' E.


8" (7/16/82): faint, small.  A mag 10 star at the east edge interferes.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6956 = H III-219 = h2086 on 19 Oct 1784 (sweep 299) and noted "eF; vS; stellar; just preceding a small star, 240 verified it with difficulty."  JH made a single observation and recorded "vF; S; 15" precedes and is attached to the double star No. 1566 of my 4th catalogue."  His position for HJ 1566 matches the two stars mentioned in my 24" observation, altlhough the WDS identifies a pair that is off the east side of UGC 11620.

John Herschel discovered NGC 6958 = h3841 on 24 Aug 1834 and recorded "B; R; pgmbM: 25"; follows 4 stars; of which one is 9m."  His position is accurate.  Using his 5-inch refractor at Vanderbilt, Barnard described NGC 6958 as "close following three or four small bright stars.  The light from these stars makes it difficult to see the nebula, which small pretty suddenly much brighter in the middle to a flickering, ill-defined nucleus.  I can not see why it should be called bright in G.C., probably in the southern hemisphere it is much brighter."

R.J. Mitchell, LdR's observing assistant, discovered NGC 6959 = Big. 84 on 27 Aug 1857, while observing the NGC 6962 group.  He noted "[labeled object] a is lE, bM" and his sketch confirms the identity with CGCG 374-013 = PGC 65369.  Bigourdan found this galaxy again 22 Sep 1884.  His RA in his 2nd Comptes Rendus list is 10 seconds too small, but was corrected in his last Comptes Rendus list.  Bigourdan is credited with the discovery in the NGC due to a confusion about what objects were found at Birr Castle.


The RNGC misidentifies LEDA 162626 as NGC 6959.  The RNGC then mislabels the correct NGC 6959 as NGC 6965.  See my article on the identities of this group in Deep Sky, Fall 1985.

Bright, extremely large, very elongated N-S, stretches across the entire low power field while passing through the bright unequal double 52 Cygni = 4.3/9.5 at 6".  Fans out to the south and splits into two delicate branches and fainter wisps.  The bright curving nebulosity north of 52 Cygni has a remarkable "electric" quality.  It has an abrupt bend about midway and then tapers down to a narrow tip towards the north end gently bowing out towards the west side.  Fantastic detail using a 20mm Nagler and OIII filter.


11x80 (5/26/84): both sections of Veil are easily visible in the 11x80 finder using a filter.


15x50 IS binoculars (8/27/11): the entire Veil was visible (eastern section was striking) using a pair of UHC filters threaded over the objectives.  The western section through 52 Cygni took more care to view and the forked southern half was the most difficult section to pick up.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6960 = H V-15 = h2088 on 7 Sep 1784 (sweep 259) and recorded "Extended from one number to the other [in declination]; pB, taking in 'k' [52] Cygni in its extent.  The milky ray is convex towards the following side in that part which lies north of k, pretty compact and equally bright.  On the southern side of 'k' it is less bright and at last loses itself with some extension, perhaps in two braches, but it is not bright enough that I may determine this circumstance with certainty.  The breadth of the northern parts is near 2', the southern branch is less defined."  Soon after in the same sweep he encountered NGC 6979 (the northern section of the Veil).  On the previous night (sweep 258) he discovered NGC 6992, the main eastern portion of the Veil and


JH recorded 3 observations.  On sweep 178 he noted "The place is that of k Cygni, through which the nebula passes.  It is very long and winding and runs northward from k full 2 fields breadth (30').  One branch is pretty conspicuous, even in a little moonlight.  The nebulosity is milky, and does not seem to arise from small stars of the Milky Way."  Isaac Roberts took the first photograph of the NGC 6960 on 28 Sep 1891.

Dreyer incorrectly assumed this object was seen by d'Arrest and that it was possibly labeled "a" in the sketch of 1857 (it's not shown on the sketch).

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered NGC 6963 = Big 85 on 12 Aug 1885 and recorded "mag 13.4; a star involved in nebulosity."  The NGC position is 2.6' N of NGC 6965 = CGCG 374-016 and the RNGC, CGCG, UGC and MCG misidentify this galaxy as NGC 6963.  This error goes back to the 1921 Helwan Observatory bulletin 21, based on photos taken in 1914-15.

R.J. Mitchell, LdR's observing assistant, discovered NGC 6965 on 27 Aug 1857 in the NGC 6963 group.  He labeled this galaxy as "b" and noted "S, nearly R, bM.".  The sketch clearly indicates NGC 6965 = CGCG 374-016.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer had to estimate the position and placed this galaxy 3' too far south.  This was caused by a poorly indicated direction of drift (west) in the sketch.  Bigourdan later reobserved this galaxy, gave an accurate position, and it was catalogued again as IC 5058.  So, NGC 6965 = IC 5058 = CGCG 374-016.


The Helwan Observatory 1921 bulletin has descriptions (and misidentifications based on the poor positions) for the entire NGC 6962 group.  NGC 6965 was described as "Not shown, exposure 90. min.  Inclusion in the NGC probably a mistake."


As far as more modern catalogues, RNGC, UGC, CGCG, and MCG all misidentify this galaxy as NGC 6963.  The galaxy labeled as NGC 6965 in RNGC is actually NGC 6959 = CGCG 374-013.  UGC, MCG, CGCG all mislabel NGC 6967 = CGCG 374-018 as NGC 6965. In Deep Sky, Fall 1985 I incorrectly concluded that NGC 6965 was a duplicate entry for Bigourdan's NGC 6963, but NGC 6963 is a double star.

At 323x it was occasionally resolved but it was easy to see how this might be assumed to be a nebulous object. Located 3.4' NE of NGC 6962 and at the midpoint of NGC 6962 and NGC 6967 3.2' further NE.


Heinrich d'Arrest probably discovered NGC 6966 = Big 86 on 26 Jul 1865.  About 1' north of his (single) position is a close double star at 20 47 26.8 +00 22 04 (2000) with a separation of 3"-4" (currently).  Guillaume Bigourdan rediscovered the same pair on 27 Jul 1884.  His micrometric position is unambiguous.  The Helwan Observatory list for 1921 reported "no nebula here" and Dorothy Carlson perhaps first made the identification with a double star in her 1940 NGC errata list.

NGC 6974 = Veil Nebula

20 51 04 +31 49 42; Cyg


18" (8/3/11): although the NGC position (from the 4th Earl of Rosse) is 74' further south in an empty section of the Veil, this number is generally applied to the southeast end of the 25' section of nebulosity between the north end of Pickering's Triangular Wisp and the north end of NGC 6992/5 (eastern section of the Veil).  This patch is roughly 4'x2.5' in size and contains three brighter stars.  A thread of nebulosity extends NW and then spreads out at the NW end (see NGC 6979).  Extremely faint haze extends at least 20' SE  towards a slightly brighter patch (see notes on section G).


18" (7/31/08): at 73x (31mm Nagler) and an OIII filter, this is a locally brighter patch at the SE end of a 25' elongated section of the Veil to the east of the northern end of Pickering's Wedge.  Although not plotted on Megastar, Uranometria or MSA, very faint nebulosity continues to stream to the SE throughout most of the 1.1° field of the 31mm Nagler and ending near a slightly brighter patch (see notes on piece G) at 20 51.1 +32 23 (2000).


17.5" (9/7/91): smaller southern portion of a very faint elongated patch with NGC 6979 in the Veil Nebula.  Several faint stars are superimposed.  Located east of the north edge of the widest section of the huge triangular wedge of nebulosity in the center of the Veil.  Also see NGC 6979.


The NGC identification is very uncertain as the 4th Earl of Rosse's position was 74' further south and there is no nebulosity near his position.


Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse, discovered NGC 6974 on 20 Aug 1873 and described a "Nebulous *, neby cE pf, 20h 45.5m NPD 59d 50'±."  This position precesses to 20h 50.8m +30d 38'± (2000) and places it somewhere in the central region on the Veil.


The RNGC position is on the southeast end of the section that includes NGC 6979, over a degree due north of Parsons' position.  Also, this piece of nebulosity is not "cE pf", but extended generally north-south."  Still, Corwin feels this is a plausible candidate (digit error in the declination).  In any case, the identification of this number is uncertain because of these discrepancies.

NGC 6979 = Veil Nebula

Size 5'x3'


18" (8/3/11): this number is generally applied to the NW end of a fairly faint 20'x4' section of the Veil, located the NE of the northern end of Pickering's Triangular Wisp.  The NW end is roughly 5'x3' and involves a few stars including a couple on the SW side and a couple on the north side.  An isolated filament (section "F") oriented NNW-SSE is situated 10' ENE of NGC 6979.  To the south of NGC 6979 the nebulosity thins and a faint thread extends to the SE before spreading out again on the SE end (see NGC 6974), about 15' from NGC 6979.


18" (7/31/08): this is the north end of a very elongated section of the Veil to the NE of Pickering's Wedge.  Although the entire section is reasonably prominent at 73x using an OIII filter, the northern end which corresponds to the position of NGC 6979 doesn't really stand out, other than ending here and involving a few mag 10 stars.  The north end of Pickering's Wedge is in fact much brighter with a wealth of filamentary detail.


17.5" (9/7/91): very faint, fairly large, elongated ~NNW-SSE, detached patch in the Veil Nebula.  The SSE portion of this patch (identified in the RNGC as NGC 6974) is smaller and has several faint stars superimposed.  The northern part (NGC 6979) is larger and wider but less well-defined and has some brighter stars superimposed.  This patch is located NE of the northern end of the huge triangular wedge ("Pickering's Wedge") that forms the north central section of the Veil.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6979 = H II-206, along with NGC 6960, on 7 Sep 1784 (sweep 259) and noted "F, S, crookedly elongated, r[esolvable]".  Dreyer mentions in Scientific Papers that this section of the Veil nebula was not found at Birr Castle on three occasions although on one observation "extremeley faint" nebulosity was noted.


RNGC and Uranometria 2000 use the NGC position, though this points to extremely low surface brightness filaments.  Harold Corwin's position matches the northeast section of a fairly faint 20'x4' filament situated northeast of the north end of Pickering's Triangular Wisp.

17.5" (7/17/01): at 380x, the halo is very irregular and the globular has a very uneven surface brightness.  The non-symmetrical halo is elongated ~E-W, perhaps 4'x3'.  The brighter 1.5' core is covered with a sprinkling a 8-10 faint stars.  From the core there are short ragged extensions to the SW and NW with a few resolved stars.  More prominent is a nearly detached clump on the east side which is extended ~N-S and contains roughly 8 easily resolved stars over haze.  In total, perhaps two dozen stars are resolved in moments of good seeing.

17.5" (8/2/86): very mottled, ragged irregular appearance. 15-20 stars resolved over the disc.


13.1" (9/29/84): very mottled non-symmetrical appearance with a bright core.  Roughly a dozen stars are resolved mostly on the east side of the core.  A brighter mag 13.5 star is in the NE side of the halo.


Pierre Méchain discovered M72 = NGC 6981 = h2090 on 30 Aug 1780.  First observed by Herschel on 28 Sep 1783 using his 8-inch (10-ft focal length) and noted as "fairly resolved into small stars."  WH made a detailed observation on 30 Oct 1810 using the 40-foot telescope (48-inch):  Having been about 20 minutes at the telescope to prepare the eyes properly for seeing critical objects, the 72nd of the Connois came into the field.  It is a very bright object.  It is a cluster of stars of a round figure, but the very faint stars on the outside of these sorts of clusters are generally a little dispersed so as to deviate from a very perfect circular form; the telescopes which have the greatest light shew this best.  It is very gradually extremely condensed in the center, but with much attention even there the stars may be distinguished.  Power 280x.  There are many stars in the field of view with it, but they are of many magnitudes and totally different from the excessively small ones that compose the cluster.  It is not possible to form an idea of the number of stars that may be in such a cluster, but I think we cannot estimate them by hundreds.  The diameter is about 1/5 of the field = 1' 53".6."  John Herschel also resolved this cluster on 4 Oct 1825: "F; R; gbM; resolved into very small stars; 2 or 3' diam."

17.5" (9/23/95): at 100x appears to be simply a large Milky Way field about 20' diameter in the "Canada" portion of the "North American" nebula.  Weakly more enhanced than the surrounding star field and only distinguished because of four bright stars off the south side including mag 5.5 SAO 50187 (off the SW edge) and three mag 7.5-8.5 cradling the south edge and forming an obtuse isosceles triangle.  Requires low power or appears similar to the average Milky Way patch.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6989 = H VIII-82 on 11 Sep 1790 (sweep 959) and recorded "A large cl of pS stars of several sizes."  His position is 10' northeast of mag 5.5 HD 199098 in the northwest corner of the North America Nebula.  JH made two observations under VIII. 82, though he added a question mark.  In the first observation (sweep 189) he did not measure a position and simply noted "Viewed.  A mere clustering portion of the Milky Way."  In the second (sweep 203) he recorded "Coarse, poor, pL cluster; stars small."  His position, though, is 27' northeast of his fathers, and this entry later became NGC 6996.  So, it's not clear if his sone ever saw H. VIII 82.  Karl Reinmuth calls this "a very dense region, no distinct cL; 4 B st s."  See Corwin's notes for more.

30" (10/10/15 - OzSky): at 394x; moderately bright, very elongated 3:1 N-S, 0.9'x0.35', slightly mottled appearance but no well defined core.  A mag 12 star is at the south tip, 0.6' from center.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6990 = h3847 on 9 Jul 1834 and recorded "a * 10m, to which is attached or almost so, by its extremity an eF, vS nebulous ray; vmE in meridian 15" l; 4" br; night superb, and without this condition it were useless to look for this object."  His position (measured twice) is accurate.

17.5" (10/24/92): at John Herschel's position and matching his description for h2091 is a scattered group of approximately 20 stars in a 6' field which is located about 10' SW of IC 5076 and a mag 5.7 star.  Three equal mag stars are collinear on the east side and a mag 8.5 star is on the SW side.  There are no dense knots or a core and this collection of stars barely stands out in the field.


At William Herschel's original position and description (VIII 76) is a scattered group of stars involved with IC 5076 and mag 5.7 SAO 50246.  Nebulosity (IC 5076) is visible on the west side of a striking 5' group of stars centered on the bright star.  Ten of the stars surrounding the mag 5.7 star form a semi-circle including a tight quadruple 2' SE.  John Herschel's h2091 lies ~10' WSW and either object could be taken for NGC 6991.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6991 = H VIII-76 = h2091 on 27 Sep 1788 (sweep 866) and recorded "A st 6m not in H.  A L star surrounded with many considerable stars, forming a brilliant though much sc[attered] cluster; the star 6m is not in the center but towards the following side."  His offset points to mag 5.7 HD 199478 at 20 55 49.7 +47 25 04 (2000), which is the star involved with reflection nebula IC 5076.  JH recorded two observations , but they refer to a separate group about 12' southwest!  In sweep 210 he recorded "a star 9m; the largest of a cluster."  His position on this sweep is 8 seconds of RA west of mag 8.4 SAO 50220 at 20 54 43.4 +47 16 50.  In sweep 209 the diameter is given as 6'.


So, there are two candidates for NGC 6991.  My notes described both candidates.  Lynga and RNGC identify WH's group as NGC 6991.  Also see Harold Corwin's identification notes and Brent Archinal's monograph on the nonexistent RNGC open clusters.

NGC 6992 = SNR G74.0-08.5 = Ced 182b = Veil Nebula

20 56 19 +31 44 36; Cyg

Size 60'x8'


17.5" (7/5/86): this section of the Veil nebula is probably the most detailed and exciting emission object to explore in the 17.5" using a 20mm Nagler and OIII filter.  Appears very bright, extremely large, very elongated, about 1° length, crossed by darker rifts.  Feather-like side branches are at the south edge running off towards the west.  The breathtaking filamentary detail at 83x using an OIII filter is too intricate to describe, particularly on the southern half!  The filaments appear like intertwined threads or twisted ropes giving a striking 3-dimensional appearance along the length! Attached to NGC 6995 and IC 1340 to the south.


13" (5/21/82): incredibly detailed at the south edge.  Wispy structure with two long tails.  Darker rifts and filamentary structure along the entire length.


8" (5/21/82): bright at 50x with UHC filter.  Some structure seen with darker rifts and branches at the south edge.


15x50 IS binoculars (8/27/11): NGC 6992/6995 is striking at just 15x using a pair of UHC filters threaded over the objectives as a long, curving filament.  Although NGC 6960 through 52 Cygni was also visible in the same binocular field, it's is a tougher object, particularly the fainter (forked) southern portion.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6992 = H V-14 = h2092 on 6 Sep 1784 (sweep 258) and recorded "eF, above 3/4° long and 6, 8 or 10' broad.  The whiteness entirely of the milky kind, brighter in 3 or 4 places than in the rest.  The position of the ray or extent is from np to sf [northwest to southeast], making an angle of 30 or 40° with the meridian.  The stars of the galaxy [Milky Way] are scattered over it in the same manner as the rest of the heavens.  The time and number is taken in the brightest part of the nebula.  The ray is faint enough to have been overlooked had it not been for the brighter places in it."  The following night (sweep 259) he discovered the western section of the Veil Nebula (NGC 6960) and reobserved the eastern section, finding "Branching nebulosity of the extent of the number that is 53' in polar distance, and in RA reaches through 5 or 6 fields that is near 1 1/2 degrees.  The following part of it is divided into several streams and windings which after separating meet each other again towards the south."  Herschel's rough sketch was publication in his 1811 paper (Fig. 1) as an example "of extensive diffused Nebulosity".  NGC 6992 is generally applied to the northern portion of the eastern half of the Veil Nebula.


John Herschel first observed the Veil on 7 Sep 1825 (sweep 8) mentioned "The whole neighborhood seems affected with wisps or cirro-stratus-like masses of nebula."  This was the original of the nickname "Cirrus Nebula", though the moniker "Veil Nebula" was probably first introduced by Leland Copeland.  E.P. Mason made an excellent sketch in 1838.

17.5" (8/4/02): at 220x appeared very faint, fairly small, round, 40" diameter, low even surface brightness.  Not noticed initially near position, but once identified could just hold steadily with concentration.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 6993 is uncertain because of a very poor discovery position but it roughly matches Leavenworth's field sketch and description.


Francis Leavenworth discovered NGC 6993 = LM 1-236 on 8 Jul 1885 and recorded "mag 14.0, vS, R, sbMN."  His very rough position (nearest minute of RA) happens to correspond with extremely faint PGC 776139 at 20 59 28.8 -25 41 24.  But Harold Corwin examining Leavenworth's discovery sketch and it does not match this galaxy or star field.  Corwin found the sketch best matches ESO 529-011 = PGC 65671, located 5.5 minutes west and 13' north of Leavenworth's position.  But this identification still leaves some uncertainty (see Corwin's identification notes).

V = 9.7;  Size 3'


17.5" (9/7/91): four stars in a "Y" asterism.  On the west side are the two fainter stars mag 11.5 and 12 oriented WNW-ESE which form the stem of the "Y".  A mag 10 star is on the SE branch and a mag 10.5 star is on the NE branch.  This is an unimpressive asterism.


8": four stars mag 10.5, 10.5, 11.0 and 12.0 in a small group, easily resolved at 100x.


Charles Messier discovered M73 = NGC 6994 on 4/5 Oct 1780 and recorded a "Cluster of three or four small stars, which resembles a nebula at first sight, containing a little nebulosity."  On 28 Sep 1783 during his Messier survey, WH noted "consists of a few stars in a triangular form. No nebulosity among them." (10-foot, 150x).


The Hipparcos data places the four stars at different distances, so this is an optical quadruple -- a true asterism.

17.5" (7/5/86): feather-like side branches on the south end  run off towards the west.  Using an OIII filter at 83x, the breathtaking filamentary detail is too detailed to fully describe but the filaments appear like intertwined threads or twisted ropes giving a striking 3-dimensional appearance!


13.1" (7/5/86): this is the amazingly detailed southern end of the eastern section of the Veil Nebula attached to NGC 6992 and contains beautiful feather-like side branches to the west, especially using an OIII filter.  See description of NGC 6992.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6995 = h2093 on 7 Sep 1825 (sweep 8) and recorded "A most wonderful phenomenon.  A very large space 20' or 30' broad in PD and 1m or 2m in RA, full of nebula and stars mixed.  The nebula is decidedly attached to the stars and is as decidedly not stellar.  It forms irregular lace-work marked out by stars, but some parts decidedly nebulous, wherein no stars can be seen.  A figure (from which the drawing for the engraving was copied), represents the general character, but not the minute details of this objects, which would be extremely difficult to give with any degree of fidelity."  Ebenezer Mason was first to point out the Herschel's position was exactly 1° too far south based on Mason's careful observations and sketch (around 1838).   Herschel's description and sketch clearly refer to the southern portion of the eastern half of the Veil Nebula.  The northern half carries the number NGC 6992.  This was only John Herschel's 6th overall discovery!

NGC 6996

Size 5'


18" (8/12/07): at 115x, ~40 stars mag 10-14 in a 6' region are mostly arranged in a "C" arrangement (or three sides of a rectangle), opening on the NW side.  Stands out somewhat in the field but not striking.  Located on the north (Canada) side of the North America Nebula.  More interesting is that on the east side of the group and curving around the north side is a well-defined fairly high contrast dark nebula (Barnard 353).  I had the impression that the stars in the "cluster" were perhaps an absorption hole in this dark cloud.


17.5" (9/23/95): about 50 stars mag 10 and fainter within an 8'-10' group in the northeast part of the North American nebula.  Fairly well-detached and distinguishable in a low power field but appears to be a typical Milky Way cloud with no particular dense spots.  Situated about 10' NW of a striking equilateral triangle of mag 8/9 stars with sides 2' (center at 20 57.0 +45 19).  Barnard 353 (low contrast) is just following. The RNGC misidentifies NGC 6997 as NGC 6696.


John Herschel discovered NGC 6996 = h2094 on 28 Oct 1828 and noted "viewed.  A mere clustering portion of the Milky Way."  No position was given.  On sweep 293 he logged "Coarse, poor, pL cluster, stars small." His position corresponds with a scattered group of stars in the northern portion of the North America nebula.  He was apparently looking for his father's  H VIII- 82 = NGC 6989 and was uncertain if they were equivalent.  NGC 6996 and 6989 are two different Milky Way fields, based on JH's single position.


The RNGC misidentifies NGC 6997 (50' further south) as NGC 6996 (error originated by Hogg).  See Corwin's notes.

18" (8/12/07): very nice group of ~75 stars at 73x in a 12' diameter.  A number of the stars are arranged in an oval outline extended ~E-W.  The cluster is fairly rich although there is no clear border and another smaller grouping is nearly adjacent to the NW.  Located towards the "East Coast" (west side) of the North America Nebula (on images the cluster is closer to the position of Lake Erie).  Several mag 6-7 stars are within 15'-20' of the cluster including mag 6 HD 199579 17' S and mag 5.6 HD 199870 20' SE.


17.5" (7/17/93): about 50 stars in a 10' diameter.  Located in the eastern U.S. portion of the North America Nebula.  Includes many mag 10.5-12 stars.  There are no rich portions and the group is somewhat scattered.  Roughly circular outline, weak concentration in center.


13.1" (6/30/84): fairly prominent scattered group at the west edge of NGC 7000 (this is the "east" coast of the US outline).  Located midway between two bright mag 6.0 and 6.8 stars with a 30' separation N-S.


William Herschel discovered NGC 6997 = H VIII-58, along with NGC 7000 (next entry in the sweep), on 24 Oct 1786 (sweep 620), and recorded "a cl of stars."  On 11 Sep 1790 (sweep 959) he logged "a cl of considerably L stars." and measured a good position. This star group is situated within the East Coast part of the North America nebula and is possibly superimposed in the foreground of the North America nebula. The RNGC and Lynga misidentify the group as NGC 6996.   See Corwin's notes.
