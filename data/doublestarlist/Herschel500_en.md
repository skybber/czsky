The Herschel 500 Double Stars

Selection from the five William Herschel (1738-1822) catalogs

This is a selection from the five William Herschel (1738-1822) catalogs available at the index page linked below: his Class I ("most difficult"), Class II ("close but measurable"), 
Class III ("5 to 15 arcsecond separation""), Class IV ("15 to 30 arcsecond separation") and Class V ("30 to 60 arcsecond separation") lists entire, all published in 1782 and 1784. 
It excludes all unidentified and duplicate entries, and most stars whose separation is outside the "class" limits of each catalog. The file is sorted by Right Ascension and makes 
a useful target list for seasonal observing and GoTo computerized telescope mounts. ? I created these lists to commemorate Herschel's extraordinary achievement in double star exploration, 
which has been overshadowed by his equally remarkable achievements in deep sky astronomy (the "Herschel 500" list) and telescope construction. These 500 double stars sample the complete range 
of Herschel's double star targets, from stars that can be separated with binoculars to stars requiring 10 inch or greater aperture. Many are tests of observing skill. This file excludes 
Herschel's notes and my comments and includes only the most recent double star separation (rho) and position angle (theta) data, with the change in value since Herschel's time. The file 
also includes the commonly used catalog designation for each system in the Washington Double Star database. Note that, unlike the Messier deep sky objects (which have retained Messier's 
catalog numbering up to the present day, despite the fact that they have been incorporated into more recent catalogs and in many cases were not discovered by Messier), about 
85% of the systems discovered or independently discovered by Herschel have been assigned to more recent catalogs by Friedrich Wilhelm Struve, John Herschel, James South and others. ? I hope 
this summary provides an interesting introduction to double star astronomy, restores Herschel's claims to priority, and creates wider awareness of the double star achievements 
of one of the greatest visual astronomers.
