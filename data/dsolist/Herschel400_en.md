Herschel 400 Catalog

Selection of bright objects from NGC catalog

Selection of bright objects from NGC catalog, that are not in Messier catalog.

The Herschel 400 catalogue is a subset of William Herschel's original Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, selected
by Brenda F. Guzman (Branchett), Lydel Guzman, Paul Jones, James Morrison, Peggy Taylor and Sara Saey of the Ancient City Astronomy Club
in St. Augustine, Florida, United States c. 1980. They decided to generate the list after reading a letter[1] published in Sky & Telescope
by James Mullaney of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. In this letter Mr. Mullaney suggested that William Herschel's original catalogue
of 2,500 objects would be an excellent basis for deep sky object selection for amateur astronomers looking for a challenge after completing
the Messier Catalogue.
