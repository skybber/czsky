I have always pushed my telescopes to its visible limits. No matter what size it
was. I have always got extreme pleasure at seeing distant galaxies that were a
billion or more light years away. There is something hard to explain to a novice
why we do this and the satisfaction it brings at catching some ancient photons
from some distant object even if its just a smuts in the eyepiece. With that said
this is how the Far Out list got started.
Recently a paper about super luminous galaxies at a high redshift was brought to
my attention by Steve Gottlieb. On a recent observing run we observed several
galaxies from the Super Spiral list and we were surprised that we could see spiral
galaxies with a light travel time of 2 + billion light years. This got me thinking if
there was galaxies in the NGC/IC catalog that had a light travel time of one billion
light years or more. This is how the list got started. Who knew there was so many
galaxies with a light travel time of one billion light years plus in the NGC/IC
catalog!
I would like to thank Steve Gottlieb for all his help and support in putting this list
together. Also the list would not be possible with out the the search engines that
my good friend Akarsh Simha provided. He really made this possible. I also would
like to say thanks to Wolfgang Steinicke for his help and information he provided.

Clear Skies, Jimi
