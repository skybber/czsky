Hickson Compact Group

In the 1970s, Canadian astronomer Paul Hickson systematically searched for groups of galaxies on photographic plates
Palomar (POSS) and published his first results in 1982. The final catalogue of 100 objects was published in 1994.
The criteria for inclusion in the catalogue were a membership of at least 4 galaxies with maximum luminosity differences of 3 mag, compactness
and isolation from the surroundings. The aim of these compilations was, among other things, to investigate dark matter.

The Hickson catalogue is interesting to amateurs for several reasons. In addition to well-known groups such as the "Stephan's Quintet" or the
the galaxies around NGC 3190, a large number of objects can be observed with medium-sized telescopes. From a visual and photographic point of view
photographic and visual, they are often challenging, but their compactness makes them extremely attractive observing targets that can be
without exception from central European latitudes.
