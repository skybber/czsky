Vic's Asterisms

Vic's Selection of Interesting Asterisms

Vic's selection of asterisms is a compilation of intriguing celestial objects in our night sky that you won't find in typical maps and catalogs, yet they are worth your attention. Asterisms are random groupings of often unrelated stars that, with a bit of imagination, form peculiar patterns.

The list doesn't include all asterisms by any means. Additional ones are gradually added, and some are intentionally omitted. It is focused on beautiful objects suitable for binoculars ranging from 10x50 to 25x100 or larger. The ratings are purely subjective, considering aesthetic appeal and the ability of the asterism to accurately reflect its name â€“ in other words, how well the description captures what can actually be seen.
