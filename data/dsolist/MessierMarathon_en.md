Messier Marathon

Challenge to observe all 110 objects in the Messier Catalog in one night.

The Messier Marathon is an astronomical challenge where enthusiasts aim to observe all 110 objects from the 
Messier Catalog in a single night. This event is best undertaken in March or early April, during a new moon, 
when the conditions allow all objects to be visible. Observers must plan carefully to catch fleeting objects 
low in the sky at dusk and dawn, progressing across the sky throughout the night.

The marathon was invented in the 1970s by Donald Machholz, a renowned amateur astronomer and prolific comet 
discoverer, along with Tom Hoffelder and Tom Reiland. Itâ€™s a true test of stamina, skill, and dedication, 
offering a rewarding opportunity to explore the wonders of the cosmos.
