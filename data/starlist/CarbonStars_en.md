Carbon stars

Adapted Stephenson catalogue (1989) of Cool Galactic Carbon Stars

Carbon stars are evolved cool giants (and some time dwarf) with circumstellar shells or clouds of carbon dust material. The typical temperature surface range from 2000K and 3000K. The apparent color of this stars is deep red and all are irregular or semi-regular variables.

The C2 Swan bands dominate the spectral distribution (at wavelength of 4380A, 4738A, 5165A, 5635A, 6122A). Also visible are the absorption C3 bands (4056A), CN (i.e. cyanogen at 3880A, 4217A, 7699A), CH and SiC2 bands, and often strong Na line at 5893A. One of the classification scheme of spectra is like C2,3. The first number indicates decreasing temperature from 0 to 9 (2 for the example). The second number indicates strength of the carbon bands from 1 to 5 (3 for the example). Carbon stars are also classified into N and R series, where N stars are older stars. An N9 star is redder and cooler than a N1 star.

The list below is adapted from Stephenson, 1989, catalogue of Cool Galactic Carbon Stars (2 Ed.) and contain carbon stars brighter then Mv<8.5. Epoch= J2000. See: [Cool Galactic Carbon Stars, 2nd Edition](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?III/156)
