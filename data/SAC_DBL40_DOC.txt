        SAGUARO ASTRONOMY CLUB DOUBLE STAR DATABASE VERSION 4.0
                    dated July 4, 2008

Many members of our astronomy club have always enjoyed the beauty of multiple 
stars and in an effort to provide a list of these objects, this project was 
begun. We are not foolish enough to believe that it is complete, but it 
should be a good starting point for many amateur double star observers with 
modest telescopes.

The previous versions of the SAC double star database have been created by 
starting with a large professional set of data, usually the Washington 
Double Star (WDS) catalog. We found that approach to provide plenty of 
stars but we found that size just created an overwhelming observing list. 

So, this time we came at the problem from the other direction. Instead 
of creating a double star database from a huge file, we would put together 
the information from a wide variety of modest sources and created a larger 
file of multiple stars that have been discussed in the astronomical 
literature. In other words--someone at some point said that these stars 
are worth observing.

There are three versions of the database in this release, in an effort to 
provide the users of the data the most useful format for their computer.  
The "fence" version is a text file that has a vertical bar, or fence, 
between each field.  The "QCQ" version is a quote comma quote delimited (CSV) 
version so that the user can easier import it into a variety of spreadsheets 
or database managers.  The third version is in the form or an Excel 
spreadsheet.  

A description of the fields and what data they contain follows:

Field Number: 11    Name:  NOTES                        Size:  62  (Char)
To prevent errors in some database import programs, we did not use a 
double quote mark (") for arc seconds, two single quotes ('') were used.

Several abbreviations were used in the Notes section:

CoCo = Color Contrast, the star exhibits a difference in color between the
       primary and secondary.

Colors   =   B  = blue,
             BG = blue-green
             BW = blue-white
             Gn = green
             Gy = gray
             L  = lilac
             O  = orange
             P  = purple
             R  = red,
             T  = topaz (pale yellow)
             V  = violet
             W  = white
             Y  = yellow

Magnitude Contrast = the stars appear very different in brightness.

var = variable, the magnitude of the star changes with time.

We are well aware of the "wildness" of some of the colors, some of which cannot
be possible considering Planck's Radiation Law. However, they are historical
and based on the possibility that the response of the eye is rather variable
and the mind of the observer sometimes may get fanciful. Use your own
judgement.

If the binary pair is generally no more than half a magnitude different and
the spectral class is close, the term "Almost Matched Pair" is used. If the
magnitude difference is less than 0.2 of a magnitude and the spectral classes
of the members is almost the same or actually the same, the term "Well Matched
Pair" is used. There are problems with this method in that different sources
might have different values for either or both magnitude and spectral class.
So, here again, consider the terms general and use your own judgement.


Field Number: 12    Name:  U2000                        Size:   3  (Char)
The charts in the Uranometria 2000.0 that map the area of sky in which the
star is located. It is not guaranteed that all multiple stars plotted on U2000
are contained in the database but we are trying.


Field Number: 13    Name:  TIRION                       Size:   2  (Char)
The charts in the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0 that map the area of sky in which
the star is located. This is included so that a less detailed view of the area
will be available to star hoppers.


Field Number: 14    Name:  BRIGHT STAR ATLAS            Size:   3  (Char)
The charts in the Bright Star Atlas that map the area of sky in which the star
is located. Of the three chart names included this is the smallest scale.

Field Number: 15    Name:  SAO                          Size:   6  (Char)
The number for this star in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory survey.
There are several digital finder systems that use this number.

                        CONTRIBUTORS

Bill Anderson put a number of different data sources into the original Master 
Data File after getting numerous fields to have some uniformity, organizing 
the data so as to make subsequent work much easier and doing a lot of 
reorganization as the project continued. He also wrote the program for 
determining the Tirion, U2000 and Bright Star Atlas chart numbers.

Steve Coe wrote the file you are reading and checked and entered data. He 
is also the one to do the internet work associated with questions and 
uploading the files. His particular expertise was finding the SAO numbers 
so that users of telescopes with computers that have that data installed 
can easily find these stars.  One interesting touch was his adding in 
binaries in which one of the members was a carbon star. Look in the "NOTES" 
for those additions.

A.J. Crayon and Al Steiweg did error corrections.

Brian Skiff provided us with error checking data and gave us input on 
what to include for each entry.



                       REVISION HISTORY

Version  1.0 was the raw data from the output of a Quick Basic search routine
that was written by Bill Anderson and Steve Coe and run against the Washington
Double Star catalog as we received it.

Version  1.1 was the output from Alan Gore's dBase III+ program to parse the
star names from the NOTES.

Version  1.2 contained the precessed values for position and added the chart
numbers. Steve Stanford wrote the chart numbering program and Kent Hepburn
interfaced it with the data from the WDS.

Version  1.3 was a quick check to make certain that we had not lost any
"famous" doubles while dealing with the above operations.

Version  1.4 was the output of a comprehensive check that lasted several
months trying to catch any errors, large or small, in the data or
documentation. All the above versions were internal to the SAC and did not get
a general release to the public.

Versions 1.5 thru 1.8 were intermediate revisions done by Dan Ward to
eliminate some data format inconsistencies. A few non-SAC members received
copies of one or more of these versions. When Dan finished 1.9, the rest of
the team went through it again to make one more check prior to release.

Version  2.0 is hereby placed in the public domain. It is our first release of
the double star database for general use.

Version  2.1 is released to fix a problem that Quick Basic had with values of
Declination near the equator. The algorithms in QB just don't understand
negative zero!! A dec such as - 00 32 was forced to become positive. So we had
to go through all the stars near the equator and check their declinations.

Version  3.0 is a brand new attempt to create a useful double star database
that contains a listing of multiple stars that are worth observing. Many
sources of information about double stars were combined to provide as complete
a set of data as could be found.

Version 3.1 fixed three or four problems.  It would not have been released so
quickly, except several of the stars are famous and would have stood out.

Version 3.3 added some doubles that were sent to me by email from several 
sources, a few of the stars are bright and have Flamsteed numbers, so I 
added them in and made a new release.

Version 4.0 was an effort to make the data as clean as possible.  The data was reviewed and a few errors were found in positions and seperations.  Some NOTES were added to provide more information about each star.

                         FINAL NOTES

We realize that such an undertaking could not possibly be completed without
some errors or typos creeping into the database. We would like you to get in
contact with us if you find any problems.
